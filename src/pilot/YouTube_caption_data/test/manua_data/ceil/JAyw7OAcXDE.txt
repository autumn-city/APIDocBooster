localcanofdutchgold: wow wow
flippe31: do we still hate the speaker or what
ryugavegeta: Damn always flexing George
fronyyo: explicit
ttimpe: They would still have the copyright on the music itself.
walruous: You can definitely get copyrighted for that
kklisura: Was he able to reverse the libraries from last night?
arhamkaiser: woah there
daghers: They don’t copyright the whole vid. They just mute the parts it played. And if he was silent anyway it doesn’t matter too much
oreo_171: @ryugavegeta you are beggin to get banned for the past few streams, geo hates fan bois LUL

rahLLi: just play your rap song
panpsychism_: twitch too
daghers: I’ve never heard of that
alycia: You cant get banned now though I think, tey wil start banning people soon
asaalgk: why not train an adversarial model that modifies audio minimally that bypasses dmca algos
LABZdotEU: it's amazing how a programmer can get 500 people to watch his stream on twitch :D
panpsychism_: it's a recent policy for twitch
Invert3dReality: they definately ban you if u get 3 strikes I ve seen it happen
ttimpe: Twitch is currently getting hundreds of requests by the German RIAA (GEMA as it’s called). They never really worked out a deal.
walruous: @asaalgk Thinking big brain
LABZdotEU: working on ane again?

walruous: You can stream this song all day
mobal: !followage
hexadecimalinteger: How he can write code on all these languages wtff
Thomasbrah: so nobody has been here long enough to tell me what he is trying to do with the chip ?
mobal: he is a professional pro
aodhneine: hexadecimalinteger, why not?
aodhneine: Thomasbrah, he's trying to make tinygrud run on it
codingbryan: I have no idea what he’s doing but I still love watching lol
walruous: ^
hexadecimalinteger: @aodhneine the moment I try to learn a 2nd language I forget the first one, rip
MrReflection99: this guy never stops coding
MrReflection99: lmao
walruous: @hexadecimalinteger That happens to me all the time
walruous: But it
mobal: Taylor Swift? :D
deep_research: did he convert the model from pytorch to protobuf or something?
walruous: But it's always easier to pick up the old one again
aodhneine: hexadecimalinteger, so you're just using them too infrequently for them to stick in your memory
elyahood: george you told me once making your own NN lib is stupidity squared -.-
alamender: Can you share your terminal config

ezeql8: key boaard ? Kappa
marschr: so… thneed for ane today?
walruous: @reeldill120 It's him trying to get his neural net to run on Apple's boosted chip i'm pretty sure
localcanofdutchgold: men don't program @walruous EZ
walruous: @localcanofdutchgold you got me there
DailyDisclosure: damn
walruous: What does that make george?

alamender: is your GF also a coder?
organistfred: What is he doing?
DailyDisclosure: lol
Thomasbrah: @alamender i dont think that is his gf
aodhneine: organistfred, he's trying to make tinygrud run on apple neural engine
FargioFarmani: Is the M1 Neural Engine comparable to running code on the RTX 3090?
rbsrbs: oh boi thats a +5 productivity
walruous: @localcanofdutchgold Nah he's def just a decision tree
DailyDisclosure: YO
whitsyerhing: George pretty much does mukbang streams with some programming.

ArbitRandomUser1: is there an SDK for the M1's neural engine?
walruous: Like 30 minutes ago
elyahood: george you said writing your own NN lib was a waste of time. Explain this
Thomasbrah: @alamender lol well i was thinking it was his sister he was staying with
axlebear: hi mommy hotz
aodhneine: aimon1337, why? it's not like it matters AT ALL
mobal: pretty lady, let him programming and brings food KappaHD
Thomasbrah: somebody in chat trolled me
BiotekNick: 7 cents on the dollar u mean?
walruous: @elyahood It's probably a waste of time to write it for production
mescal33t: NomNom
Ziv0: how are you liking the M1?
walruous: You can write it for learning purposes
bananiel66: NaM
alamender: HOWS M1
bigie: are you trying to get GPU acceleration for tinygrad ?
marschr: thneed for ane real?
walruous: What's the diff?
morocco0: Apple neural engine
ArbitRandomUser1: how are we on opencl ?
alamender: Anyways Good morning GERGE
bigie: is it apple's version of CUDA cores ?
vincentcutepogi: Hello sir can you explain to me like im 5 years old what you are doing
alamender: GEORGE**
Wireballz: @georgehotz Can it do 4k youtube on M1 ?
kurumuz12: lol ofc
whitsyerhing: Why is ANE going to be needed soon. What do we have to look forward to?
alamender: @Wireballz YAAS
aodhneine: people who don't know what's ane/apple neural network - read https://github.com/hollance/neural-engine/ this
crucialOri: are you interested in having another podcast with Lex Fridman ?
axlebear: using ghidra over hopper, bold
Wireballz: Sweet
walruous: @vincentcutepogi He is getting his neural network to utilize the Apple Neural Engine to accelerate his training
alamender: LMAO his username is SMOL
axlebear: you can do dmesg --follow
djceci: oh he is not writing his neural network in assembly gotcha
absoluutely_: the m1 mac sees day 2 of use, maybe he’s getting attached
alamender: imagine watching his stream but u r not a programmer
Singpafo: asmr
alamender: asmr
viluliinaxx: cmonBruh
bigie: are the docs so bad you have to get kernel trace to see the calls ?
deep_research: The die surface area for neural engine is like 1/2 of the GPU. What's everyone's guess for the inference time boost running on neural engine vs the M1 GPU - or maybe you can USE ALL THE THINGS with the on chip ram. This is exciting!!
naisuu42: KEKW
viluliinaxx: jailbreak shkreli when

aodhneine: kurumuz12, normie? today's chat sucks even more than yesterday
rbsrbs: @kurumuz12 you must be new here
winningbigforever: there are a ton of people from lex fridman i think
walruous: @nuripower It's sort of like (not really) like the cuda cores on the Nvidia RTX if you're familiar with those. It's specialized to run Neural nets. It's pretty new relatively.
bigie: what's the point of the neural engine if only apple's stuff runs on it?
Jeptah88: @kurumuz12 It's OK, I just arrived.
1Horsepower: @murraydrover 20 year old thinkpad
kurumuz12: it was pretty fine yesterday
viluliinaxx: @aodhneine False

walruous: Pennsylvania?
kurumuz12: @r0renzu nah it has the same exact chip
UntiedSoul: has george ever mentioned any books/textbooks/blogs to read
ayli__xd: Can someone explain to stupid guy like me what is he doing right now?
kurumuz12: search engines are all you need
bigie: that looks like a "normal" string
ryugavegeta: @untiedsoul He read a blog about some building ancient
rbsrbs: @ayli__xd hacking the mainframe obviously
Ekaeo: how's m1 so far
kurumuz12: @ayli__xd reverse engineering ANE so he can trigger it to use in tinygrad
walruous: @UntiedSoul Check out the Lex interview #2, he gives a pretty concise take on what you need to do if you want to learn computer science pretty thoroughly
frode_0xa: @UntiedSoul Watch the latest Lex Fridmann with George
jacekakacz: If I would have a server which get ip adresses from clients but don't save it so I need some permission, legaly stuff like RODO??
walruous: But of course its a take, what actually works varies from person to person
ayli__xd: @kurumuz12 thanks, can you explain me what is tinygard?
axlebear: george is going to segfault the simulation someday
walruous: @ayli__xd well are you familiar with gradients in general?
UntiedSoul: thanks chat! thats what inspired me to ask. He mentioned yudowsky, unqualified reservations
r0renzu: @kurumuz12 Ahhh I’ve been lied to. Not that I’ll be buying a Mac
hyper_aleks: so you guys in chat, have you guys performed any type of hacking lately or do you guys have jobs?
kurumuz12: tinygrad is george's neural network framework, its named tinygrad because its really smol @ayli__xd
UntiedSoul: and the hudl competition
pharaohskaro: @ayli__xd google the Apple neural engine.
akrwp: He said learn assembly, c and python
walruous: I'm selling my windows laptop for a mac
crakeenn: love you
walruous: Don't know if I should wait for apple silicon or not
kurumuz12: so he's planning to use apple's neural accelerator with his NN framework
walruous: ^exactly
kurumuz12: I will wait for the M2 kek
kurumuz12: 2 ports is not enough
ryugavegeta: Does George watch anime
walruous: Thing is
grahambojangles_: does anyone know what he's looking in the memory for?
ghhernandes: the mbp 13 have 3 ports
walruous: Is the switch to ARM gonna be as seemless as Apple making it seem like it is
ghhernandes: 4*
xrealyy: is he on mac air?
gaschu: m2 is gonna have 1 port
guest1GRjBAYo: does the M1 run on ARM?
gaschu: m3 none
SlayerX1: LUL
carus11: the switch to arm will only be seamless when enough Devs fix all the open source toolz
alycia: he is on mac book ground
kurumuz12: We cant see it george
goto3: you live in a parking lot?
pharaohskaro: @georgehotz this work bring you back to CTFing at all?
clamsino: hey I saw this guy on Lex Fridman, he's cute as heck
kurumuz12: your webcam is covering it
axlebear: m4 is going to have negative ports
Tusk_sb: im "renting" the base air to play with and resell before m2
UntiedSoul: it's covered by the camera
flippe31: lets just approximate battery life i'd say its 55% right now
carus11: so grab a device and help test them out
ryugavegeta: @pharaohskaro Dont ask about ctf man he gets annoyed
pahil: is he using a second monitor to stream off?
UntiedSoul: schrodingers battery life
gaschu: m4 will have a second bluetooth radio
bigie: what kind of SDK access would an apple developer get to ANE ?
zer0ch1ll_: I wonder if I could beat up Lex Fridman
pahil: @zer0ch1ll_ LOL do u do mma?
optimaltransport: apparently NSObject is the low level representation of code on all apple chips
zer0ch1ll_: @pahil not even once
winningbigforever: no haven't you heard lex fridman is a badass, he likes the idea of doing hunting
pahil: my moneys on him then
bigie: he'd destroy you while thinking about love, peace and human-robot interaction @zer0ch1ll_
kurumuz12: lex would choke you out in seconds
winningbigforever: he's like 5'4 right
pharaohskaro: @optimaltransport I was wondering the same thing
ryugavegeta: Yeah choke with his tie
UntiedSoul: qn: how did he get the stack from the left? did he run a benchmark program?
zer0ch1ll_: if I distracted him with a poem first I think I'd have enough time to strike
pahil: if he knows bjj he could be 4'6 and beat u
axlebear: george do you microdose?
iamFIURE: OBS is native or running by rosseta 2?
ryugavegeta: He does nano pal
kurumuz12: rosetta
Tusk_sb: i cant even imagine lex in the ring
UntiedSoul: thanks
optimaltransport: @pharaohskaro this article has a good paragraph on that: https://daringfireball.net/2020/11/the_m1_macs
gaschu: @iamFIURE Linus LTT was running it on rosetta
professorlogicx: George, any tips for understanding intermediate ML/DL
optimaltransport: "Retaining and releasing an NSObject is a low-level operation that is foundational to Apple’s programming frameworks. Just about everything is an object, and when an object is being used, software retains it, and when it’s done being used, the software releases it. This is reference counting in a nutshell: every time an object is retained, its reference count increments. Every time that object is released, its reference count decrements. When it goes to zero, the system frees the object from mem
Tusk_sb: lex is so peaceful
iamFIURE: I was impressed by how smooth the stream goes with obs by rosseta 2
ryugavegeta: "We do things on stream not because they are easy but because they are useless"-Geohot 2019

ryugavegeta: You talk about elo rating i thought
bigie: will becoming an apple dev give you easier access to ANE ?
kurumuz12: im over 3000
Jeptah88: I'm just j/k @ryugavegeta , I don't know what I'm saying
matnesis: @professorlogicx look for interesting papers on cool deep learning things, and try to code that by yourself, also fast.ai is probably the best tutorial, but, you need to code the problems yourself
TusKaN_BaNaNas: @LibTiff Dog its not nut november still you gotta get off the stream then
aodhneine: bigie, probably
kingvoneduard: This is the Simulation code and he try to break it and go in the Dimension 5
kurumuz12: your elo is rated by the DL gods
ryugavegeta: @jeptah88 90 percent dont know what they say out here pal
supeerius: Henlo

gussyyy_: @FreshHummus true - it'll take time for the transition - but in the meantime - we can enjoy this amazing M1 chip
FreshHummus: Taylor Swift
gussyyy_: hence why I'm on this stream :)

optimaltransport: just start a new blank Swift project via xcode
HDIP: BibleThump
BiscuitCoin: Time to abandon Swift.
FreshHummus: @gussyyy_ Not really, I think they are all pretty close now, good reviews on amazon and can't go wrong. Just make sure it can do 4k60fps if thats something you care about

MarioBGE: There should just be a python based OS, would make this kinda stuff so much easier
prostidude221: can someone explain why he needs to do this in the first place? Why cant he compile tinygrad on the new M1 more easily?
alamender: @MarioBGE Good point ....... Ask GeoHotZ for making one
Andremm2: @prostidude221 the neuro engine is not available for third party devs
westonwaldo: no I don't think thats right
sn4kex: does your gf understands what your saying rn ?
mk1729: Guao : 'P
gaschu: you have 2 outputFileName
westonwaldo: BINGO not unkonwn file

prostidude221: @Andremm2 well that sounds scummy LUL
Andremm2: that's apple for ya LUL
Keyeh: how is apple selling airs without homebrew though?

Keyeh: or is it using that rosetta instruction translation stuff
westonwaldo: try p02 funtion
westonwaldo: no the array is wrong
michelfugain420: what mouse are you using pls

westonwaldo: fixed it for you
westonwaldo: CFMutableDictionaryRef
lesserthangood: this guy just pasted code into twitch chat
michelfugain420: XD
bankzed: I can put you in touch with Apple HW or SW engineers, that's all I can offer, but I'm sure you know way more engineers there.
Thezla: what a legend
mk1729: ```CFStringRef strs[3]; CFArrayRef anArray; strs[0] = CFSTR("String One"); strs[1] = CFSTR("String Two"); strs[2] = CFSTR("String Three"); anArray = CFArrayCreate(NULL, (void *)strs, 3, &kCFTypeArrayCallBacks); CFShow(anArray); CFRelease(anArray);```
mk1729: Markdown doesn't work : 'P
westonwaldo: we can't type enough code in chat because of your mods
grateful_tomato: objective-c was nice when they invented it, in 1984, nowadays there are better languages
lesserthangood: use pastebin
michelfugain420: @grateful_tomato yes, there is html5
Wrathedd: monkaS
grateful_tomato: @michelfugain420 that's not a language
her3hero: nice
westonwaldo: .....
westonwaldo: nice
youngsachi: PogChamp

cpaleop: say thanks :)
doctorpoopee: @westonwaldo kudos
Andremm2: weston can relax now LUL
michelfugain420: @grateful_tomato Wait what Pepega
westonwaldo: <3
SlinkyWP: mmm yes 5Head
grateful_tomato: not a programming language
bespoke_code: @westonwaldo GG
her3hero: contents "h13" hmm
westonwaldo: George if you can share your screen I can do everything
alamender: Who wants HIM to teach us Neural Network
jmp0ut: did you pull all the math algos out of the fpu?
westonwaldo: this can be my job application XD
Landepbs: is the h13 right?
michelfugain420: @westonwaldo are you a swift programmer?
westonwaldo: @michelfugain420 no just from 4chan
brade0g11: What language is this?
cpaleop: xd
lesserthangood: c++
michelfugain420: @westonwaldo what do you mean by that
doctorpoopee: @michelfugain420 i don't think there is such a thing called a swift programmer
trajenx: looks like assembly
Wrathedd: i could never work with these editors i can't ready shit
brade0g11: ty @lesserthangood
michelfugain420: @doctorpoopee weel swift is a language, isnt it?
doctorpoopee: Kappa
michelfugain420: Kappa
westonwaldo: all what George is doing is really not that hard. he is just copy/paste code from stack overflow super easy
TJSparks: lol
westonwaldo: this is the guy we are suppose to trust drive our cars XD
trajenx: why is he using this hacker program?
westonwaldo: sorrysorry i'll stop
bespoke_code: this is what real programming looks like, especially when you're not familiar with the matter. The best thing to learn here is George's thought process and the tools he uses to analyze the errors which pop out at execution time :)
saim7: KEK
cpaleop: he's from 4chan tho
klasher125: This is real software engineering
michelfugain420: Don't ban him, he's a 4chan swift programmer

chatdogy: whats the status have he managed to crack ANE? and to something with that
Webmasterdro: he doesnt have friends in anonymous
Andremm2: @chatdogy not yet
toastedgorilla: does it make sense to watch his streams if you dont understand so much ?
grateful_tomato: @chatdogy he is still learning objective-c
her3hero: set the H13 to "h13" and continue
bankzed: @toastedgorilla yes, the first state of knowledge is admitting your lack of it
westonwaldo: hmm George is there any way you can share your work? perhaps we could audit the code and let you know
cwk20: @georgehotz hel,
fh1m: hi

FreshHummus: @trajenx :)
ZuppaSalata: @trajenx Pog
FreshHummus: I got the pink macbook air too
her3hero: just backup /dev/null and replace it
myaocat: lldb attach and add -o /dev/stdout
miche_____: trajenx ThankEgg

her3hero: haha
sanneck: h13 looks like the zce ball number
myaocat: the pid is the process id
ViVonner: Thanks for lower qualities, can watch from africa FeelsGoodMan
NegDuHood: 64gb is overkill
PutYourMoneyOnMe: gpt3 bots in the chat
ArtemisCosmo: @NegDuHood unless you are 3d artist right?
FreshHummus: We're all gpt3 bots
her3hero: https://github.com/ewust/nullspy
ArtemisCosmo: even then 32 is probably enough
TJSparks: 0600 permission or something
MashCus: Wouldnt gpt3 come up with sensible chat messages?
FreshHummus: @MashCus LUL
NegDuHood: @ArtemisCosmo no you would need a good gpu for that not ram
ArtemisCosmo: ah
bitman777: is the hacking in mr robot fairly accurate to how its actually done? anyone know?
Landepbs: I am way out of my depth here but there is something in the ARM64RegisterInfo of LLVM about h13.
Thezla: they are using real techniques
her3hero: would this work? https://github.com/ewust/nullspy
Pixel_Community_Project: @bitman777 its pretty close, more accurate then the usual stuff
fdfdfdfdfdfdff: 64GB for my i9-9900k works well when im running MPI processes locally with 1000s of blocks in a simulation
fdfdfdfdfdfdff: though thats basically only for debugging
fdfdfdfdfdfdff: i started swapping with 16k blocks
NYCyril: touch /tmp/log

UltraScientism: this is just brute forcing your way LUL I would have read the lldb man page or something
ArtemisCosmo: I have 2017 Pro mid spec, suppose I will wait for M2 16'
ArtemisCosmo: the current m1 pro blows mine out of the water though
ArtemisCosmo: tempting
darkzade: emoneySwag
FreshHummus: @ArtemisCosmo Join the pink macbook air club.
TJSparks: Sadge its not doing what I want it to
bolderhero: did george buy a pink mba?
kernelwarden: @ArtemisCosmo m1 doesn't have virtualization support. might be another killer criteria..
ArtemisCosmo: not a huge fan of that pink
NegDuHood: @bolderhero
NegDuHood: yes KappaPride
PutYourMoneyOnMe: can you put a break point in cfshow and call it with the h13 thing?
changing_variable: noob here, what is he doing right now?
0xHSN: @georgehotz where do your rent ubuntu VPSs from?
Creamy_Goodness_: @changing_variable have u heard of skynet?
changing_variable: yea
ArtemisCosmo: @kernelwarden I'm a visual designer so I don't really need it
NegDuHood: modCheck battery %?
FreshHummus: @kernelwarden It does have virtulisation but I think it's different to the technology in intel and amd chips, vmware said they would support m1
ArtemisCosmo: I use Final Cut, logic, adobe suite, Xcode rarely
kernelwarden: @ArtemisCosmo nice - lucky u :P
afterworktech: 53 %
smurfd0: did you see that Apple have kernel debug kit that you can remote from another machine and catch things via lldb from the kernel...
NegDuHood: !uptime
BiscuitCoin: That battery life is so good.
afterworktech: @ElGreko17 3:08:27
Tusk_sb: look at that rose gold
Tusk_sb: bling bling
iskjmss: while streaming??

ArtemisCosmo: @aknaveg13 base air with m1
ArtemisCosmo: @FreshHummus I don't actually know
FreshHummus: Ah
myaocat: NSLog redirected to Console
changing_variable: have he tried to turn it off and on again?
RengarSenpai: it's not really 5nm, 7nm is already an inaccurate description
prince___amir: guess what? : tomorrow i have algorithm exam and i'm watching george
prince___amir: isn't that cool
ryugavegeta: George you are persistent 1000
ArtemisCosmo: hey Linus this iPad without touch is pretty good
trajenx: you can just cast pointers to void*
FreshHummus: @prince___amir go study, George wouldnt be happy that you fail

FreshHummus: @vadzim_tv I think he's written a few lines at least
ArtemisCosmo: @NegDuHood oh shi I didn't know about external monitor, thought it's a webcam
smurfd0: h13 is from a13? :)
uk245: hey guys is george's current vimrc public? the one on his github is only like 10 lines

Denis0109: which font is he using, I cant figure it out
NegDuHood: m1 master race SeemsGood
hiphopsucks: which shampoo does he use
Matharp: Does the debugger not have readline-esque keybinds?

ELEMENTiQ1337: @m113v nope
Kobayawaka: @m113v yes
nairdabackwards: whats so special about m1
FreshHummus: @nairdabackwards pretty fast and low power
afterworktech: @nairdabackwards https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/
nairdabackwards: ty
trajenx: it might be because its a 'static string' and that is why it is being formatted in a weird way in the debugger. they can be comparing strings using pointer comparison
NegDuHood: m1 air > m1 pro
MarioBGE: How good is it compared to cuda?
ChickyNugs: i love steev
ArtemisCosmo: @NegDuHood Pro has a bit more juice
ArtemisCosmo: which is handy

metacritical: Kernel panics are rare on Mac due to Darwins modular architecture.
ArtemisCosmo: lul cache didn't fix
ArtemisCosmo: how is this even possible
salvdelg: happy hacking george
ArtemisCosmo: George hacked me
metacritical: Linux on the other hand well you can easily have panics with even one faulty module.

OetziOfficial: OetziOfficial subscribed at Tier 1.
myaocat: so when you run CoreML it can run on GPU, CPU and ANE. But you can use expose those functions and call them without coreML decides if it want to run on GPU/CPU i think LUL
winsomehax: Has Crapple not documented this stuff?
UltraScientism: @smurfd0 I understand that, but using debugger is not how development supposed to happen. So it's undocumented api or private?
Kobayawaka: both
smurfd0: apples neural egine is not well documented yet
UltraScientism: Well, undocumented and private is the same thing. I'm Pepegaing

hir0andobey: what about nvidia tensor cores?
metacritical: All of those things are ASICS
FreshHummus: @hir0andobey it's better than not using it on a new mac :P
metacritical: They are build for that task,
hir0andobey: but why use a mac for ml then?
FreshHummus: @hir0andobey I think george might even somewhat consider this "fun"
UltraScientism: So apple doesn't expose its NE directly and you have to use it through core ML only for predefined use cases or something?
BiscuitCoin: I mean the Tensorflows benchmark suggests it is much faster than the Intel GPUs atleast.

Shashwatkthnxbye: i found a free pdf
Erciks: the thing is C is huge and if you are asking what PL you should go for indicates that you might not be experienced, and if you are, you would already know what to do. Not trying to be mean or anything. It would be best to focus on what you are trying to learn. Jumping around definetly not going to help @Shashwatkthnxbye

Shashwatkthnxbye: but sir if best way to learn is by problem solving what can I solve in C?
Shashwatkthnxbye: i cant write apps and make websites right
afterworktech: so fancy this documentation. is pissing me off....
unodosthree: @Shashwatkthnxbye You need do projects. Use a book and web just as reference, instead of reading it straight through. For instance if your learning C, start out with making a double linked list.
friedbeefed: what's that beeping?
Erciks: okey I feel like you are moving forward too fast. Try to understand fundemantals first
oreo_171: @Shashwatkthnxbye google projects in C, pick something you find interesting, google your way to the solution. you'll learn a lot along the way
Shashwatkthnxbye: ok thnx alot
slimpimp007: george is beta testing for apple rn

techtim123: Objectively speaking of course
bonfues: @Zepcon7 i think so but plugged into another screen - so maybe has charge
instagrab: @Shashwatkthnxbye just learn C++ instead bruh
MrVitoDayz: or pascal
Shashwatkthnxbye: Oh
Shashwatkthnxbye: so many languages
RealOden: C is probably not a great first language to learn imo, there is too much going on with memory to be able to focus on big picture stuff of a project
fiendodto: hey george!
unodosthree: @Shashwatkthnxbye although If I were just starting out now, I just learn python
commandpaul: @Shashwatkthnxbye bhai hacker rank pe grind kar
doctorpoopee: i think c is a great first lang because its all up from there
commandpaul: THats how i learnt
fireposeidoncx: @georgehotz thoughts on joscha bach?
Erciks: @Shashwatkthnxbye remember, it will not be easy and there can be a lot of struggle. Just do not give up. This might sound like buzz word but, yeahh...
unodosthree: very easy to get started with
twintowerpower: HolyC
oreo_171: @Shashwatkthnxbye i am assuming you are from india as well, so definitely c++ would be more beneficial in the long run for academics and college placements.
wtf_my_name_already_taken: what do you mean by that: "if you are asking why, you are missing the point"
commandpaul: Wanan pe C ya Pyton me kar
Shashwatkthnxbye: Didn't geroge hotz say in lex video to learn assembly and C?
Shashwatkthnxbye: @oreo_171 ohhh ok
commandpaul: So pick C Then , That What I went With
unodosthree: @Shashwatkthnxbye eventually you want to go back and learn C and assembly
RealOden: Python if you want to learn programming, C if you want to learn about programming
doctorpoopee: why would you learn c for algorithms and such, if you want to learn c build something
commandpaul: I do HW design , All I use is C and Assembly other than HDLs
commandpaul: GGs lmao
unodosthree: but python is very easy to get started with compared to C and assembly.
instagrab: LMAO
funnlimited: wow
bonfues: @unodosthree yeah python is good. any language is good if you eventually wanna go deep into C/C++ since it all ultimately traces back to c/c++
Erciks: oh boy assembly.. I wouldnt recommend learning assembly now
fireposeidoncx: can anyone actually keep up with his programming? lol
nejintejag: Are we using coreml to understand how the nural engine works? I can't see how tinygrad connects to this. Tinygrad will need some type of computaion on the Nural engine right?
UltraScientism: @oreo_171 Learning C++ is a whole enterprise and spends too much time on the language itself. C++ is VERY COMPLEX language, if we are talking about really knowing it.
Erciks: not yet atleast
Supgoku: LuL
zup_zup: i love your struggle, cause i share it
smurfd0: copy past from stackoverflow = real coder :D
raad1masum: did geohot go to cmu?
pedrito_02: can anyone explain to me briefly what is he doing? i don't know what the Apple Neural Engine is
fiendodto: any experienced programmers care to explain the big picture of wtf george is doing ?
Shashwatkthnxbye: im more confused now :p
unodosthree: @bonfues Oh for sure you wanna go back learn C and Assembly, but to start out I go with a higher level language so you can start making stuff right away with low overhead
Supgoku: copypasta from stackoverflow
doctorpoopee: c and assembly are really good first languages if you can find a good book or have a good guide or something
UltraScientism: @fiendodto He's trying to use Apples Neural engine in their new chips, and I think his main struggle is poor documentation, so he has to basically reverse engineer his way through.
FreshHummus: @fiendodto I think he's trying to cause the battery to explode in the macbook, something about not being about to buy fireworks because he got id'ed
commandpaul: Indians saale Placement ke peeche padhe rethe hai , goto Hacker Rank and Do everything that you can in C
fireposeidoncx: tbh everyone in here probably just reading the chat because no one knows what he is doing lol
funnlimited: p for ... ?
Erciks: programming is bigger than what you think it might be. Don't try to understand everything. You cannot learn everything. @Shashwatkthnxbye
Supgoku: I know Kappa
Shashwatkthnxbye: @commandpaul is hackerrank good for beginners?
oreo_171: @UltraScientism i don't think he "really" wants to know it, only a few people alive really know c++ imo, i just think it would be nice to get him started and get into programming and even aid him in his academics, trust me its a major focus here in india
commandpaul: yes
grateful_tomato: he is trying to learn objective-c by looking at the assembler code :-)
instagrab: Chat: What will the end result be?
DarkEpopt: has ghidra overtaken ida now?
Shashwatkthnxbye: @Erciks i want to get into AR and VR once I'm good
epistemologist_: hello!
fiendodto: @grateful_tomato is he teaching himself a language?
r3ndd: he's trying to reverse engineer the libraries for the neural engine so that he can write his own code that runs on the chip
RealOden: If you say you know C++ you're full of shit
fiendodto: oh
commandpaul: Start problem solving with code first , AR VR baad me
mik12f4: hey George, how do I learn things?
byte_baron: if i had to guess, reverse engineering an apple device to be able to make use of their hardware for ML?
twintowerpower: You learn by doing
Shashwatkthnxbye: ok thnx
fiendodto: why must he reverse engineer it exactly
cpaleop: lol
byte_baron: isn't this like... illegal?
myaocat: br s -r 'H11ANE*' maybe
funnlimited: stackoverflow is best resource to ever exist
ggtom: 🤔
ProBeats: @mik12f4 George would say just do it
bonfues: i guess he's reverse engineering the neural engine API? bc it's a private api?
ProBeats: try it
ryseek: Does he use new m1 MacBook ??
byte_baron: @fiendodto from what i've googled, apple doesn't allow 'third parties' to make use of the hardware for ML, it's for apple exclusive apps
Erciks: yeah but just do it step by step. Focus on programming fundemantals first. Once you get familiar with stuff, it will be easy for you to decide how you want to achieve what you want @Shashwatkthnxbye
ProBeats: @ryseek he has the macbook air
r3ndd: @byte_baron I take it you don't know who George is
her3hero: learn this one simple lldb trick. apple hates this trick
Shashwatkthnxbye: ok thnx everyone
byte_baron: @r3ndd i know he's a hacker, yes
fiendodto: ohhh hes trying to jail break his way into their ML thingy
UltraScientism: @oreo_171 We ought not to recommend him to become a mediocre C++ programmer. One has to know C to basically know how computers and OSs work, and then he could choose his path, but C++ is specialising in systems programming, and it's not for everyone.
bonfues: @fiendodto yah seems like it
instagrab: need to watch stream from beginning after it is archived. I am missing some key information.
epistemologist_: @Shashwatkthnxbye honestly, the one thing that i've learned from these streams is you just gotta do shit
mik12f4: i know i was just messing around
jtparker: Because it never works as expected :D
ryseek: @probeats thanks SeemsGood
Erciks: yeah C++ might be too much for now, I agree
mik12f4: i know how much he like when people ask that
Shashwatkthnxbye: @epistemologist_ ill keep that in mind sir
FreshHummus: @byte_baron not true, software goes through CoreML which decides if it should run on the ANE, you basically ask nicely and it will either run on it or not but it only will allow certain operations.
fireposeidoncx: terry davis would have already be done lol
ggtom: fireposeidoncx dont mention that legend here bro
r3ndd: If you want to learn the basics of reverse engineering for free I recommend pwncollege
FreshHummus: @fireposeidoncx We can only aspire to be as good as Terry
grateful_tomato: I guess he wants to use it for his tinygrad thing, instead of just using TensorFlow which already supports it, like everyone else does
instagrab: @FreshHummus who is Terry?
fireposeidoncx: @ggtom we need more divine intellect in here
epistemologist_: @Shashwatkthnxbye like when george was writing the scheme interpreter, i was following along and that led me down a rabbit hole of learning haskell and just learning different programming langauges/paradigms
Shashwatkthnxbye: Also is it necessary to get a CS degree? I don't think my parents can afford it rn
epistemologist_: @Shashwatkthnxbye hell no
MrVitoDayz: @epistemologist_ what's your use for haskell ?
grizvok: no, you don't need a degree.
unodosthree: @Shashwatkthnxbye just learn python dood. Find a beginner book that is project based. No Starch Press has a some good beginner books that project based.
ggtom: fireposeidoncx they are not ready for such power levels bro
instagrab: @Shashwatkthnxbye degrees are overrated
FreshHummus: @instagrab Terry Davis, he made holy C and thesmartest programmer to have ever lived. He was tasked with creating gods temple and was blessed with divine intellect.
oMYTHRA: @Shashwatkthnxbye no you don't need a degree. learn and work on projects for practical experience
commandpaul: No , youll be able to contribute to OSS after a point , but it really helps if your trying to get "Placed" or immigrate
epistemologist_: @MrVitoDayz no practical use, just an interesting rabbit hole
oreo_171: @Shashwatkthnxbye depends on where you live, for a majority of the places not really
unodosthree: @Shashwatkthnxbye From there practice extending those projects to do something new
instagrab: @FreshHummus thanks bruh
metacritical: Woah man I made a career without a CS degree, you need to self study. There are plenty of people who have created self teaching CS Degree programs for themselves.'
FreshHummus: @instagrab Check out TempleOS
kavprog: I'm going to make my own dlss program guys what language should I use?
fireposeidoncx: @FreshHummus lol
winningbigforever: hmm but how do i get a job at 18 without degree
UltraScientism: @Shashwatkthnxbye If you are not getting a CS degree, you HAVE to get the that knowledge anyway, because without it you are a code monkey, a plumber, connecting components, without significant added value.
fireposeidoncx: @kavprog holy C
kavprog: @fireposeidoncx muthafuka lmaoooo
grizvok: @winningbigforever have an impressive portfolio and proove yourself in interviews
pedrito_02: @Shashwatkthnxbye hah curb your school system... we have free universities in Czech Republic on international level (joke)
grizvok: @winningbigforever prove* even
Shashwatkthnxbye: ok tnx everyone from the bottom of my heart. I know if I get good at cs i can change my family's life.

ggtom: fireposeidoncx but can anyone improve on his work? i think not with such divine inspiration...
UltraScientism: @metacritical to which country? For many countries having a degree is a requirement for job visas.
Shashwatkthnxbye: @metacritical h1b rules are very bad sir I don't wanna go to USA, cant start my own company

Jakobo06: @smokyakasteve I know that Sentdex (Youtube dude) wrote a book for Nn in pure numpy but dont know if its any good
afterworktech: someone will figure out the location he is staying by the sounds in the environment
metacritical: @Shashwatkthnxbye Just learn programming work hard and get a job plenty companies hire in India without a degree, Including big ones like Shaadi.com
epistemologist_: @ggtom basically, you just encode the idea behind the limit definition of a derivative (i.e. ignore all terms smaller than dx^2)
alexander_1x: just tuned in what is he doin
lulzury: IN objective c callback blocks are similar to lambdas in python, they just have different formatting

Shashwatkthnxbye: @metacritical ok sir thnx
oreo_171: the pillagers are raiding again
smokyakasteve: @jakobo06 i think it just covers ann from scratch not sure if it even have cnn
quackyrabbit: Thoughts on information flow typing? Been working on that a lot recently.
FreshHummus: @metacritical and infosys will basically hire anyone LUL
epistemologist_: think of dual numbers like complex numbers, but instead of i^2=-1, you have an epsilon^2 = 0
metacritical: Infosys is a shit comopany. Just fluff no stuff.
oreo_171: @FreshHummus you could always apply for TCS LUL
FreshHummus: @metacritical I know LUL
metacritical: TCS is another Infosys.
FreshHummus: At least there is a running track though LUL
epistemologist_: if you expand any function as a taylor series, it's like f(x) = f(x0) + f'(x0) (x-x0) + O(x^2), so all the terms of O(x^2) go away from the definition of epsilon
oreo_171: @FreshHummus common man, we gotta be grateful for such opportunities LUL
ggtom: epistemologist_ ngl thats wild bro
fdfdfdfdfdfdff: @georgehotz how difficult would that c.ai programming challenge be for someone with no background in machine learning? I might tackle it for fun but it seems like a rabbit hole
ProBeats: just do it!
Jakobo06: @smokyakasteve Once you understand how a typical nn works its quite easy just to read the algorithm for cnn and implement it in pure python. Its the overall mathematics of PDEs and how to implement them which is difficult
bionicnacho: ™
FreshHummus: @oreo_171 I worked for a company that had outsourced most development to them, 20% of deployments to production worked with 4 environments and a pre-prod.
karanberries: just got in here and have no idea what's going on. this feels about right
commandpaul: GEO HOT gonna Crack the First MAC Silicon like the First Iphone
oreo_171: @metacritical companies like infosys, tcs, cognizant visited my campus and let me tell you, they were acting as if they were silicon valley giants Kappa
fdfdfdfdfdfdff: @ProBeats i have little no one knowledge of what would actually have to be done to implement a nn that would be able to learn from one mp4 how to accurately predict speeds at each frame
epistemologist_: did george turn off the thing where you have to be watching for like 3 months in order to chat
gussyyy_: @commandpaul ahh u remember them good old iphone days
bionicnacho: @fdfdfdfdfdfdff I mean you don't lose anything by just trying
gussyyy_: @epistemologist_ - he made it 1 day...it was so frustrating
bionicnacho: probably learn something along the way, even if you dont complete it
walruous: swag meal
karanberries: @epistemologist_ yes cuz now I can chat lmao
ProBeats: @fdfdfdfdfdfdff What questions can you ask to find gaps in your knowledge
epistemologist_: ohh lmao, i was waiting and i noticed that i could chat before 3 months lmao
gussyyy_: @epistemologist_ such a troll
gussyyy_: hhahah
aeron10: aeron10 subscribed with Prime.
gussyyy_: where is george based atm?
gussyyy_: NY?
marcelbischoff: San Diego
Mehinedinger: @gussyyy_ CA
gussyyy_: living the dream
fdfdfdfdfdfdff: @ProBeats i havent even done a basic image recognition machine learning nn, so thats basically where you would have to start, then apply that to a mp4 where you extract data out of each frame, and then somehow select proper data out of each frame to infer velocities from and train a model based on that. i really dont know that second part well
fireposeidoncx: deutsche hier?
nejintejag: George can you make a push to GitHub I am trying to follow along.
smurfd0: gdb 2 lldb command conversion for anyone intrested : https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/gdb_to_lldb_transition_guide/document/lldb-command-examples.html
gussyyy_: nein
fireposeidoncx: @gussyyy_ lol
epistemologist_: tbh i still dont get the math behind a neural network, but i havent looked into it in a fair bit so
fireposeidoncx: woher kommst du?
marcelbischoff: <-- deutsch
bionicnacho: @fireposeidoncx I just noticed your name, damn cx frogs are everywhere lol. You still watch ice?
Olympience: I know pretty much zero about code
gussyyy_: can any1 recommend a good MOOC machine learning course?
Shashwatkthnxbye: so complicated
byte_baron: @gussyyy_ andrew ng course
fireposeidoncx: @bionicnacho no not anymore, stopped after horse shoe bay lol
bionicnacho: lmao
ProBeats: @fdfdfdfdfdfdff thats a great start, you have some idea of what direction to go in, keep moving in that direction and you'll slowly get a clearer picture of where to go
fireposeidoncx: @bionicnacho what about you?
SHIFT256: @gussyyy_ fast ai
gussyyy_: @byte_baron - nice it looks good -v ery highly rated
ch3e3to: @gussyyy_ stanford's cs 229-machine learning course is on youtube
karanberries: @smurfd0 ooh cool
fdfdfdfdfdfdff: @ProBeats ive done logistic regression, but i would assume you would want to do SVM or CNN for image processing?
gussyyy_: damn...but it uses MatLab?
gussyyy_: surely a python based ML would be nicer?
SHIFT256: @gussyyy_ google for CS229 and then for CS231n, both courses are ok
bionicnacho: @fireposeidoncx I pretty much stopped when the mansion got raided and he moved to texas. I just check in every now and then, mainly because I made his website lol
gussyyy_: thx thx
bionicnacho: or the platform that his website runs on, rather
bsx1123: fast.ai is great for ML
karanberries: yea I went through the cs231 last year was a great learning experience
SHIFT256: fast ai is great, but lacks of homeworks and projects
karanberries: all their assignments are up there as well
ProBeats: @fdfdfdfdfdfdff CNNs are the most common ways they do ML today but require lots of data, before Alex net the the DL 'revolution', visual bag of words with certain feature extraction was the most common method
epistemologist_: figuring out how to multiply matrices of a custom object type in numpy was a pain
kingf66: @georgehotz i saw an error on line 48, you should correct it
epistemologist_: because it defaulted to O(n^3) non-numpy multiplication
fireposeidoncx: @bionicnacho I think he got unbearable after the first rv trip. All his lies made me hate him
bionicnacho: i feel you
fireposeidoncx: @bionicnacho cx network?
ProBeats: @fdfdfdfdfdfdff There is a lot to learn, but try to document what you have learned. The final result doesn't matter anywhere near as much as the journey and the process you go through
widepeoplehappier: are recurrent cnn a thing for inferring velocity?
kingf66: THATS WHAT SHE SAID
Appz_x: Jailbreak wen
ProBeats: @fdfdfdfdfdfdff its not an easy problem to solve, but even trying to understand how you might go about solving it is commendable
Daniel_Duan: Every objc method is dispatched via objc_msgSend
kingf66: Jebaited
Swendude: Ooh it's still going, where is George at?
bionicnacho: @fireposeidoncx eh, more like cx network v2 lol. The original guy disappeared when shit hit the fan with the fbi, and I had this platform implemented already so he switched over to it. The whole tracking streamers and watching multiple people at the same time on the site is on there, but he hasn't lmade like any events since and there's no network so it's all hidden
kingf66: @georgehotz what do you think about shungite ? not the rapper
cpaleop: lmfao
confidentlythrowaway: George, I'm your biggest fan! I'm 6'7" and 240 lbs
chatdogy: at the end apple wil ladd support to use ANE, its a lot of work what you have donw
remegy: my uni made me sign a statement that I wont cheat during an online test... wtf
Mehinedinger: @confidentlythrowaway False im 7ft
confidentlythrowaway: ;(((
Mehinedinger: lol
ggtom: remegy that's wild bro real wild
confidentlythrowaway: @remegy lmao contracts aren't real
UltraScientism: @confidentlythrowaway that's a big girl
fireposeidoncx: @bionicnacho oh okay, I hope he did pay you at least and that there are no hidden crypto miners lol
Thomasbrah: what is he trying to do ? like reverse engineer something that apple has done regarding the M1 chip ?
confidentlythrowaway: @UltraScientism for you
hanshellmann: lol
aimon1337: !uptime
Mehinedinger: @Thomasbrah kind of something with the NN that apple made
fireposeidoncx: @bionicnacho but I acutally miss the old days with kyle and Nathan
bionicnacho: @fireposeidoncx lmao yeah, I had him set up auto payment from paypal every month before releasing it. I heard horror stories from past devs having to jump through hoops to be able to get paid lmao
tuggek: is it true that you can beatbox
UltraScientism: @confidentlythrowaway for 95 percentile
jeff8revelator: jeff8revelator subscribed at Tier 1.
bionicnacho: @fireposeidoncx same, it was good times
nejintejag: Cant George just look at what "run.swift" sends in to the nural engine? Just send the same thing.
fireposeidoncx: @bionicnacho yeah true, the boy was no good. Ed was right from the beginning
mik12f4: George can you intern with Bionano Genomics for a week or two? I would feel more comfortable investing with you on board. Thanks bro
pedrito_02: soo, he is trying to use neural engine for his own intention?
kachokblexinity: Is this content for noobs?
Rkyrk: Yes
LABZdotEU: Can't a middleware be built that translates from tinygrad to Apple's ANE/ML APIs?
directrix13: Is the IOSurface not just a runtime introspectable way to find which mapped addresses you're looking for?
LABZdotEU: or that would not be sufficient?
Mehinedinger: @kachokblexinity no
fireposeidoncx: @bionicnacho Do you know what voldesad is up to?
confidentlythrowaway: This is programming 101, if you can't do this you're basically worthless
crucialOri: @kachokblexinity his content is never for noobs tbh xD
crucialOri: i barely know whats going on but im enjoying it lol
confidentlythrowaway: Mods, am I allowed to tease other members?
myaocat: does LD_PRELOAD works in big sur? maybe you can use that and hook that function when running python using coreml tools?
Mehinedinger: @confidentlythrowaway another false
formemi: @georgehotz I just joined, apple can use tagged 64 bit pointers for ARC optimizations
masterMau: hey george! how is everything? hope all is well! :)
bionicnacho: @fireposeidoncx no clue unfortunately, paul left him behind when he moved to tx and I dont think he's really been streaming
myaocat: maybe look that inside ghidra?
confidentlythrowaway: What's his progress at? What's he trying to do?
damini0s: how's the new macbook?
0xHSN: adgaurd disabled the twitch chat, wtf?!
alamender: how are you so good at coding
kachokblexinity: this looks very easy for me, why is he stuggling so much?
Erciks: LuL
FreshHummus: @kachokblexinity go do it then
0xHSN: nice couch
fireposeidoncx: @bionicnacho btw is he still workin with steve jobs?
localcanofdutchgold: @FreshHummus actual simp
metacritical: Practice practice and persistence, that's how you become good at coding, just like painting or any other skill.
FreshHummus: @localcanofdutchgold guilty
kachokblexinity: i mean it's just C++, not Javascript + CSS
bionicnacho: @fireposeidoncx thank god no
DayAdam: do the processors after the a12 have the neural engine as well?
0xHSN: @metacritical i mean ok, but what to work on?
alamender: haha.....i guess ill start learning neural networks
setzdichnimmdirnkeks: i think he's still trying to find a way to use the apple neural engine from tinygrad
metacritical: @0xHSN What do you fancy?
confidentlythrowaway: Is there a tool to visualise this as a graph?
Erciks: yeah its just c++, its not important what hes trying to do i guess Kappa
cpaleop: wtf
fireposeidoncx: @bionicnacho thank god!
alamender: im 15 and if i start learning neural networks......will it be worthy
myaocat: you can see in the disassembly who wrote to x1?
aodhneine: kachokblexinity, os, so then surely must know what is he doing. how would you approach this then?
moonify: Damn it one hour late, good luck on this run @georgehotz
deadpoet002: hi george
icyvran: Couldn’t this copy and paste be automated?
alamender: @icyvran NO
alamender: anyways its 4 am i gota go sleep
masterMau: what is the Apple Neural Engine gonna be used for?
confidentlythrowaway: @masterMau he's tryin to get tinygrad to work on it
makvbex: @mastermau for machine learning
0xHSN: replicating the streams is a good idea to be an elite programmer, there are 65+ streams, understanding them fully would take you 10k hours, 3hrs daily >> 9 years see you in 2029
grateful_tomato: @confidentlythrowaway couldn't he just look at the source code of TensorFlow, which has integrated it already?
epistemologist_: dude dragonctf this year had a coq challenge LUL
UMPS: that's what he said
Ziv0: it could def be automated with something like radare + r2lldb but it'd be messy
kachokblexinity: aodhneine I don't use shitty hardware such as Apple i create my own in Iron Man Cave
confidentlythrowaway: @grateful_tomato afaik no, the API is not a 1:1
setzdichnimmdirnkeks: @grateful_tomato tensorflow only uses the gpu i think
sanneck: many parameters
masterMau: oh shit, tinyGrad is his own machine learning right??
confidentlythrowaway: yup
cpaleop: haha
0xHSN: @georgehotz where do you rent VPSs from bro?
metacritical: To start programming replicating this stream is not a good idea, go do programming for a yr and then come back to this. This is reverse Engineering stuff.
mik12f4: @moonify he's practically been on for 5hrs
aodhneine: kachokblexinity, ah yes, good luck reinventing cpus then ^^
grateful_tomato: how much faster will it be anyway compared to a GPU?
0xHSN: @metacritical yeah sure, it's not for absolute beginners
confidentlythrowaway: I did reverse engineering on a BIOS and this is triggering my PTSD
setzdichnimmdirnkeks: dunno
metacritical: Yup
confidentlythrowaway: I remember doing the same thing of indenting the calls to visualise the backtraces better
Erciks: probably
komocode_: apple's new ding sound is so dissatisfying
0xHSN: nostarch books are a good start
ferdovvs: Is this c++?
grateful_tomato: @setzdichnimmdirnkeks this webpage says TensorFlow uses the new M1 chip: https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/11/accelerating-tensorflow-performance-on-mac.html
metacritical: Honestly I learn most programming from free sources so I hardly buy books.
confidentlythrowaway: tabphobic CoolCat
Thomasbrah: *ding ding
commandpaul: I hate tabs too
formemi: Chat, what is he doing? Why not just use objective-c++ with CoreML?
bionicnacho: @komocode_, damn, now i cant unhear how annoying it is
localcanofdutchgold: who the hell pays for books
jidderz: George is hacking PogU
confidentlythrowaway: @formemi hardware acceleration
siriusb_79: is there a pytorch implementation yet?
komocode_: :P
aodhneine: localcanofdutchgold, I do -_-
IncognitoJam: f
metacritical: LOL
leairondeth: xd
kachokblexinity: RIP
epistemologist_: did he just leave lmao
nejintejag: @grateful_tomato "ML Compute, Apple’s new framework that powers training for TensorFlow models right on the Mac, now lets you take advantage of accelerated CPU and GPU training on both M1- and Intel-powered Macs."
cpaleop: 4Head
devequel: f
ferdovvs: I have the same question @formemi , which language is he usin gnow?
formemi: 4Head
bionicnacho: lmao
confidentlythrowaway: @siriusb_79 no, I think he's one of the first to reverse engineer it
grateful_tomato: he is easily getting triggered, isn't he? :-)
UltraScientism: Didn't know Objective C++ was a thing. The Horror DansGame
Mehinedinger: bath room break?
confidentlythrowaway: @ferdovvs languages don't matter
LABZdotEU: Hey @georgehotz why can't we just create a middleware between Tinygrad and Apples ML APIs and use those instead of hitting the ANE directly?
0xHSN: you can get them for free, no one pays for content in 2020
milkshakegum: Hi
altrightfiveyo: bs
ggtom: that is a nice mug ngl
kachokblexinity: why he is not using VSCode? Console is for noobs
commandpaul: How much caffiene do you have every day ?
nic0latesla: what are u drink?
metacritical: Reverse engineering and finding the APIs to call a secret hardware on your CPU is hard stuff.
epistemologist_: lmao @kachokblexinity
localcanofdutchgold: @kachokblexinity VSCode DansGame
atlaslobster: disabling the sound in vim: set noerrorbells visualbell t_vb=
advitameternam85: he drinks tea
masterMau: BALLER
ggtom: 0xHSN the best statistical learning reference for me was a youtube playlist by a legendary bro
Erciks: interesting
commandpaul: The Caffiene numbers what are they
ggtom: 0xHSN and ive read all the books ppl swear by and they dont come close
LABZdotEU: can't we somehow monitor CoreML? like a wireshark for the ANE :D
epistemologist_: mfw i program most things in nano
confidentlythrowaway: my boy George is the Indiana Jones of hardware acceleration
0xHSN: yeah. there are some gems on غف
nic0latesla: thanks @advitameternam85
aodhneine: kachokblexinity, I'd say that vscode is for noobs who need constant stimulation in form of graphical interface rather than just focusing on writing the code and not caring about what editor to use
0xHSN: yeah. there are some gems on yt @ggtom
setzdichnimmdirnkeks: @grateful_tomato tbh: im not completely sure what his goals are in this session.. :-)
ggtom: 0xHSN اكيد
grateful_tomato: I don't think this makes sense, the overhead for accessing the M1 engine from any framework is negligible compared to the time M1 runs
Erciks: good editor can help
confidentlythrowaway: @aodhneine I'm a vimmer but you can make a good argument that integrating semantic understanding in the tooling is better than pure text
0xHSN: @ggtom you've caught with that
grateful_tomato: so just use CoreML and wrap it to whatever you want :-)
Maccyhuge: vscode with vim keybinds is actually not bad
epistemologist_: mfw my computer is too slow to run vscode and im too lazy to learn vim, nano is my first choice :(
0xHSN: where are u from?
kachokblexinity: aodhneine But you can write code much faster
UltraScientism: vscode is based on electron. Everything that uses electron is an abomination and must be destroyed.
Repunk: LOAcquire : https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0602/d/base-instructions-alphabetic-order/ldlarb-load-loacquire-register-byte
sw1jari: learn vim slowly, you won't regret it
myaocat: p/a address ?
kachokblexinity: UltraScientism Scientism sucks
sw1jari: learn the very basics, takes 1 minute
UltraScientism: LUL
localcanofdutchgold: you only need like 10 commands to use vim
aodhneine: kachokblexinity, with vim? yes, with vscode? yes
confidentlythrowaway: neovim > vim
mik12f4: george hotz == focus and determination
grateful_tomato: more like getting lost in rabbit holes
metacritical: Meh that's patronising George.
UltraScientism: As someone said on HN: What Apple M1 giveth, electron taketh away. LUL
masterMau: any advice on where to start when wanting to learn about ML??
kachokblexinity: aodhneine I mean i write my html code way faster using vscode
mik12f4: i guess it depends on how you look at it
confidentlythrowaway: @UltraScientism kek
ProBeats: @masterMau Just do it, pick an intro course on something like coursera and just do it
chromosundrift: @kachokblexinity @aodhneine use what works best for you?
milkshakegum: How’s the hover pole?
metacritical: Well you can replace any successful person in that statement.
aodhneine: chromosundrift, I know -_-
masterMau: @ProBeats lmao yeah that's my original idea but was also curious about other methds
ggtom: masterMau just do an example with scikit-learn or tensorflow. both are good python packages.
epistemologist_: dude you can write your code in google docs for all that it matters
bolderhero: @masterMau i would recommend brushing up on calc and linear algebra just enough to not feel totally lost
metacritical: I bet if you put: Tom & Jerry == focus and determination.
bolderhero: just as tip
ProBeats: @masterMau I think its easier to figure out where to go with a skill once you have played around with it for a bit
metacritical: It would work.
confidentlythrowaway: you can't code without knowing topology and abstract algebra
ggtom: i mean u can get away with a lot using tensorflow
ggtom: it does everything for u
SOmedude456: Hey george, when you were still doing Exploit dev, were you ever scared of crash dumps exposing your bug?
confidentlythrowaway: @ggtom George shat on it in comparison to pytorch
UltraScientism: @confidentlythrowaway don't forget cubical type theory and categorical logic
grateful_tomato: would be more interesting to think about new algorithms. I think the standard backpropagation for neuronal networks is not the best, the human brain probably don't work like this, at least not with a clean separation between learning and using the net
aeron10: @georgehotz sup man!!
ggtom: confidentlythrowaway i never used pytorch so i cant comment. but tensorflow is still good.
masterMau: thanks everyone for the advice! I'll look at playing around with it!
scelillo: !uptime
confidentlythrowaway: @UltraScientism Damn, I guess I'll forever be a brainlet ://
jkfsda: has he managed to talk with the neural engine yet?
confidentlythrowaway: @jkfsda yeah, he's reverse engineering how to load models
confidentlythrowaway: the missing sudo from he nvram last stream killed me
confidentlythrowaway: it was a missing sudo, I doublt checked
confidentlythrowaway: double*
nejintejag: yes, you missed it!!!
brysonreece: Programming for the last 10 years and would be completely lost if was doing something like this

UltraScientism: @DarkEpopt LUL
angler_jax: I have never understood a single thing you coded during your livestreams but I still tune in!
john_kosta01: :) :) :) :)
UltraScientism: @angler_jax trying to get smarter by osmosis?
zup_zup: i used to do this back in the diablo 2 days making bots
epistemologist_: im just here in chat while programming my own stuff tbh, cant really understand whats going on
Maccyhuge: I have this in the background while I do easier programming to make me feel smart
confidentlythrowaway: he's reverse engineering some compiled C/C++ dynamic libs
BotDenhart: Whats the curremt status on calling the Neural engine? Did he get anything working?
angler_jax: @UltraScientism I have found ways to succed in life without being smart, I just enjoy watching smart people doing smart things
UltraScientism: ok
grateful_tomato: it probably uses some device driver to access the M1, might be interesting to reverse engineer the low level ioctl commands
ggtom: grateful_tomato do u frequent the food channel?
grateful_tomato: no, I'm just a random tomato
ggtom: ok i see. 🍅
masterMau: what are your plans for 2021 geo?? PogChamp PogChamp
LukeRobbo_Kappa: I wonder what % of the stream is actually following this
chromosundrift: I am
tbone2max: I am among those who don't
masterMau: i dont understand much but being able to witness the goat is what I value the most
rephlexsion: how many monitors do you use
tbone2max: That would be a good chat poll
LABZdotEU: a lot of folks, but it's rather difficult keeping up with the amount of information fed to us
chromosundrift: can you use expression breakpoints?
grateful_tomato: @masterMau there is a goat in his room?
tactiledactyl: pwndebug
bsx1123: lol
cpaleop: xqcSmile
epistemologist_: why the frick have i come across bfs like 3 times in the past week in different problems i've been working on
brysonreece: Following along strawpoll https://www.strawpoll.me/35193359
Swendude: Is this a handle in the sense of a resource lock?
nejintejag: makes sense, you need to send the program to the device.
nudajobina: whats a program handle?
ausernamepng: is that ghidra
nejintejag: @nudajobina probbaly a pointer to the program.
Solely_Luck: Sup Mr. Hotz, excited to be here live for once
her3hero: almost 1k viewers
Mehinedinger: I feel like this is a rabbit hole on roids
nejintejag: like a file handler.
jkfsda: load it like it's hot
chromosundrift: do that
BotDenhart: why not do that as a starting point?
zup_zup: what's wrong georgy

devoloution1: what is the Goal in Reverse engeneering this?
zZIP: Could someone explain in simple terms what triggering the apple neural engine accomplishes? Is this for the sake of developing neural net stuff on the new mac? I don't really know what we can do with this in the end
jkfsda: IDA could've been huge if it was open source
FreshHummus: Do something apple doesnt want
metacritical: To be able to directly use Neural Engine.
BotDenhart: Getting tinygrad to use the neural engine @devoloution1
BotDenhart: I guess
UltraScientism: Apple should make a M1 based "threadripper" with 64 cores
mik12f4: @FreshHummus lol
jkfsda: i wonder how fast it will run compared to the GPU
MrVitoDayz: @UltraScientism They need increments to make money :D
metacritical: The Current API in CoreML dent let you select the NE, it may choose to run it. So Georgy if successful would write explicit NE kernels from tiny grad.
zZIP: Is it just engineering differently to be able to run on the new chip more efficiently?
MrVitoDayz: teabagging incoming@
devoloution1: ah cool thanks @metacritical
fstab: radare2>ghidra
FreshHummus: Imagine learning anything
epistemologist_: all my homies hate wolfram alpha

siriusb_79: symbolab has left the chat
robinsec: does your wife code too?
Tunelesschan: I would if could afford it LUL
UltraScientism: @metacritical Why does it behave in such a weird way?
FreshHummus: All my homies are imaginary
MrVitoDayz: @FreshHummus i'm ya hommie
epistemologist_: do your integrals by hand
MrVitoDayz: bud
Mehinedinger: @siriusb_79 lol
UltraScientism: I.e. not guaranteeing NE execution. That's f-ing insane.
nejintejag: can you check the program handle class? in obj-c
vadzim_tv: @georgehotz what did you start with early in your career, coding or specifically reverse engineering?
metacritical: @UltraScientism Meaning?
Wopahopa: kids these days don't know how to learn stuff 🤷🏼♂️
Cluwe: real pros use axiom not wolfram beta or mathematica
MrVitoDayz: @epistemologist_ hahah :D
MrVitoDayz: save the paper
Keyeh: Why not learn lisp and make a reduce imitation that integrates for you
masterMau: what software does he even use to create tinygrad?? this is all so new to me its insane
FreshHummus: @UltraScientism Only specific things are supported, CoreML tries to make sure I think.
BotDenhart: Ugrh lisp
1PiZi: LOL, that's funny cuz I'm using wolfram at this exact momment
MrVitoDayz: @Cluwe I just integrate in my head
epistemologist_: ok but for real though, i use mathematica but there is an art to evaluating integrals by hand
BotDenhart: Do it in emacs
cpaleop: xqcS GO
IncognitoJam: We have to go deeper
UltraScientism: @FreshHummus doesn't explain it. They could return error if NE doesn't support it.
chromosundrift: next LEVEL!

myaocat: @supersalohcin it sucks tho
brysonreece: strawpoll 42% of viewers are completely lost 46% somewhat understand 12% following along
BotDenhart: @Keyeh You simply have to press C-x + C-i + C-s and pres tab 3 times

chromosundrift: to do that you would need to capture hdmi out of the dev machine into a separate streaming box
Tunelesschan: HolyC++
vloood: how is he generating this much power
nic0latesla: @AkhizoN x2
epistemologist_: modify electrons on the silicon chips
metacritical: OpenGL has program handles, this could be similar.

OetziOfficial: tinykernel hahhaah lets goooo
masterMau: but seriously, what software have you used for developing tinyGrad??!?\
afterworktech: geokernel
jo_renttt: What is tinyGrad supposed to be?
AkhizoN: RIP Terry Davis :(
UltraScientism: TinyNeuralEngine.verilog
cpaleop: i guess the handle must be something that already exists in the code somewhere
BotDenhart: Find the instructions
Wopahopa: can we skip the objc crap then
scelillo: scelillo subscribed with Prime.
grateful_tomato: but the kernel driver might no have the best interface for your tinygrad, better write yourself to all the M1 processor registers :-)
rogueaj: does anyone here know wtf is going on?
jkfsda: shouldn't you have headers for the kernel
BiscuitCoin: TinyASIC who needs the M1 chip anyways.
jo_renttt: @rogueaj no :)
MrVitoDayz: I agree with @grateful_tomato
cpaleop: 4Head just create and integrate your own chip
nejintejag: @metacritical yes I don't understand what George is going for. Why is it a problem that he has to send the program throgh the service?
rogueaj: :)
Cluwe: @rogueaj no, just pretend you do. Just like school

Mehinedinger: @Cluwe LOL true
supersalohcin: Today on Twitch: George discovers the horribleness of apple "Documentation"
supersalohcin: it's amazing they get away with it.
imadon59: so boomer the icon bar on the buttom :/
tuggek: is what he does illegal?
jkfsda: boomer icons best icons
supersalohcin: not only is what he's doing illegal, you're a party to the crime by watching! leave now tuggek
imadon59: @truggek no
BotDenhart: Really illegal @tuggek
Mehinedinger: @bolderhero a lot more fun if you crush other people's work
kurumuz12: why it would be illegal
BotDenhart: Dont tell anyone
mexeroserisback: not as illegal as owning a bunch of weed in Texas

supersalohcin: he's trying to use/reverse broken apple apis to see how to use their hardware accelerated engine for certain ML tasks
goto3: any juicers?
goto3: xqcS
supersalohcin: none of it is really documented, no implementation exists yet that's open source
supersalohcin: afaik, at least.
goto3: my sub PepeHands
brysonreece: I think right now he's trying to figure out how to open a connection to the Neural Engine by diving through decompiled classes that do it already. Goal is tinygrad running with the enginer
brysonreece: *engine
Mayfieldiv: wow george so many live streams this weekend
her3hero: so who uses the neural chip ?
rogueaj: @brysonreece thanks for translating
her3hero: just apple themselves?
supersalohcin: they have a blob for tensorflow
nhyy24: thanks for the explanation!
nudajobina: in which apps Apple uses nnets?
alessandro711: Hi :D
menta1backf1ip: Should I build a browser extension that classifies annoying questions like "what is he doing" and removes it from the DOM?
UltraScientism: is neural engine more like a PCI device, and less like AVX512?
imadon59: geohotz is for CS Game what Faker is for League
her3hero: and we hate tensor flow here
brysonreece: It looks like IOServiceOpen opens the connection, and he found where it's constructed in practice; now he's reverse engineering trying to figure out how to set up constructor parameters.
bigie: how far has he gotten ?
metacritical: Yup
MrVitoDayz: how's your brain working so fast man
metacritical: Ghidra is excellent.
crakeenn: anyone recommend me learn python before java ? or java before python?
her3hero: how many calls do you think he'll need to get the full stack running?
supersalohcin: george, have you decompiled this yet? https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos
goto3: @mrvitodayz, green tea is a hell of a drug
d3g0zz: hello
supersalohcin: probably some good pointers on how they're invoking all this.
MrVitoDayz: @goto3 :D
her3hero: he wrote down all the functions. that's alot go reverse
UltraScientism: @crakeenn java before python
jo_renttt: :)
jkfsda: is alex in chat?
nejintejag: @UltraScientism I guess, it is a 8 core cpu made specifically for AI inside the new apple M1 chip.
her3hero: hi Alex. how're you?
jo_renttt: modCheck
cpaleop: xqcL alex
leesin1729: xqcL
OetziOfficial: just a simple hi
ProBeats: @supersalohcin you can't specific the neural engine with the implemetation that tensorflow use

alessandro711: nice house
TheBlackzillian: is geo still a hacker?
jo_renttt: minecraft speedruns when? Kappa
brysonreece: he hackin now
ISD_Schogol: Are we trying to achieve anything or is this just for fun?
metacritical: Ofcourse Geo is reverse engineering Neural Engine right now.
BotDenhart: He is hacking NSA right now @TheBlackzillian
BotDenhart: Ghida is NSA spy tool

31337cr3w: What’s going on I just got here
pauldevv: george is trying to get tinygrad running on apple's new neural engine
danisokpg: where he lives?
BotDenhart: Poland
yurit04: in sumulation
name100015: this is way too dank
yurit04: obviously
pauldevv: in the cloud
johan_ub: Does he have the new apple silicon chip?
alycia: Zimbabwe
supersalohcin: san diego
fabyyy: in a bunker
31337cr3w: Thank you. Does neural engine mean like pytorch/tensorflo?
pauldevv: @johan_ub yes. he bought a new pink macbook air a couple of days ago
supersalohcin: those are software frameworks, the neural engine is on silicon
BotDenhart: @31337cr3w Is hardware for doing calculations
BotDenhart: Built into the M1
yurit04: if I get a good bonus this year, I will get a nice GPU
yurit04: maybe 2 GPUs :)
ibrowwn: how are you liking the M1 so far?
TheGhostface007: @georgehotz sup Bro
ausernamepng: is he coding in Objective C
ausernamepng: or c++
metacritical: Neural Engine isnt new it is in A11 that's a 2017 Chip
nejintejag: Push to GITHUB!
31337cr3w: So a MacBook Pro from 2017 can run this?
ausernamepng: No
supersalohcin: no, no intel macbook has this
BotDenhart: It was on their phones before
supersalohcin: this is the first time that macos has had the api
OetziOfficial: is it bc it resets before usage?
bolderhero: @31337cr3w apple just started releasing laptops with their custom silicon in it
vloood: what level is the device referring to in his laptop?
supersalohcin: it's powered off because these are mobile devices and they clockgate everything
hiphopsucks: damn you still going, i thought u left hours ago
optimaltransport: where we at guys
31337cr3w: O ok I didn’t know they already started to make those. That’s with risc5?
menta1backf1ip: poland
supersalohcin: no, arm64
supersalohcin: apple was a founding member of ARM if you didnt know.
metacritical: It won't run on a MacBook Pro from 2017, perhaps a iPad from 2017.
amaranthion1991: @georgehotz Do you think QA role is overkill in development process?
LABZdotEU: yo what did I miss? Did we find a way to feed the handle?
LABZdotEU: oh no haha
fabyyy: go deeper
IncognitoJam: driver implementation time
rogueaj: DEEPER
BiscuitCoin: Lets go DEEEEEEPER
chatdogy: yee
jo_renttt: Deeper xqcS
chromosundrift: go deeper you can do it the time will be slower there
31337cr3w: Is this like apples Augmented Reality stuff.
bichid69: why import rather than include?
ProBeats: Deeper!
jo_renttt: AGANE xqcS
OetziOfficial: build a hook
chromosundrift: staaay on target...
awesomeo113: Enhance!
31337cr3w: What’s a handle? Like username?
supersalohcin: lol george aliased kk to exit
BiscuitCoin: Use React Hooks

chatdogy: deeper depper penetration
TooManyBytes: lirikDEWD
cpaleop: hmmmmmmmmm.............
nejintejag: Yeah duhhh
xxxelent: ohhh yeah as startup code?
masterMau: geoCompiler
masterMau: G++
bichid69: what are we disassembling here?
willarkitekt: willarkitekt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months, currently on a 2 month streak!
OetziOfficial: do you mean as an library?
Dario3004: hmmm....
LABZdotEU: @bichid69 the ANE APIs
bichid69: Why? isn't there documentation to use the API?
powerofpickle: what decompiler is that?
chatdogy: its apple LUL
bichid69: @powerofpickle Ghidra
powerofpickle: Thanks
fabyyy: whats the dev-> ?
bichid69: I am so confused as to why we disassembling ANE
metacritical: Because Apple is not cool and doesn't want others to understand the architecture NE hence no api.
supersalohcin: if you're still getting "powered? 0", why do you think you're gonna be able to read regs?
bichid69: @metacritical but how do they expect 3rd partys to use the "neural cores"?
Yemtex: every time the "ooohh" comes, there truth is getting closer
smurfd0: isnt it that read register finds the register id?
Yemtex: the
afterworktech: https://opensource.apple.com/ old :(
lIIIllIllIlII: Can someone explain what he is doing pls?
bichid69: did he manage to get the ipykernel working guys?
metacritical: @bichid69 Well apple approach is heavy handed you develop your neural layers using MLCore and the Compiler would decide if it would run it on NE if it finds an incompatible layer it will switch to GPU.
supersalohcin: reversing macos api for their new silicon neural coprocessor
chatdogy: its not fully implemented yet @smurfd0
quebono100: New camera?
myaocat: https://github.com/apple/coremltools/issues/412
brysonreece: @bichid69 Yeah, he committed a fix yesterday, there's still an open PR
charliekobani: @quebono100 external monitor
0xHSN: anyone could predict when virtualisation is coming to vmware on m1? wanna get a device soon
quebono100: Cool. I would like to see BERT integration in tinygrad. I looked also up, if tinygrad is a city in russia. Actually its not :D
leonardssh22: 1.1k stars at tinygrad, nice
optimaltransport: tinybert would be awesome, but I think albert is sort of the same thing
powerofpickle: When did he move from tmux to screen?
xxxelent: dont you pass a callback?
unodosthree: don't think tmux works on the m1
chromosundrift: ?
Gweppe_: hes on the new mac?
powerofpickle: ah weird
bespoke_code: @Gweppe_ yup, the M1 Air
unodosthree: at least that is someone said in a chat awhile ago... not sure if they were trolling
supersalohcin: i imagine you've seen this, yeah? https://github.com/iKilledAppl3/iOS-12.4-PrivateFrameworks-Headers-iKA/tree/master/AppleNeuralEngine.framework
metacritical: What would you do with VMWare Virtualisation on M1 ?
metacritical: Also it would be like a rewrite of the JIT in VMWare engine to support M1 I down think it is coming anytime soon.
metacritical: *dont
xxxelent: you call that one function with a callback probably spawns a daemon
IncognitoJam: tmux does work on the m1 https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/7857
Tuvok: Tmux works on the M1, but I think George always uses Screen, no?
yznm19: jee yo hot
rustduck: so whats up with the unencrypted telemetry on big sur
powerofpickle: Weird that tmux would work on arm linux but not arm mac
unodosthree: yeah u right. My bad
quebono100: 923
aodhneine: why wouldn't tmux work on m1?
unodosthree: it does work on the m1
powerofpickle: lol
masterMau: gamers gotta Game bro
Kawhiet: Is he still not partnered yet?
TheGhostface007: LUL
IncognitoJam: does minecraft work
jkfsda: tmux is slow
powerofpickle: yeah someone got minecraft java running at 200 fps on the air
chatdogy: @georgehotz wants to quit, give up, cheking viewers all the time :D
kurumuz12: minecraft works on jvm and m1 can run jvm so yes
ProBeats: long handle
xxxelent: You call the init with a callback likely it is saved and a daemon executes it
supersalohcin: ANE_ForgetFirmware what a name
supersalohcin: I've never heard of forgetting firmware.
IncognitoJam: oh no
IncognitoJam: new macbook time
BotDenhart: Dump the firmware first
BotDenhart: Kappa

TeaPardee: where in the world is geohotz
mag_m3m0ry: you may wanna install a class plugin for ghidra https://github.com/cmu-sei/pharos/tree/master/tools/ooanalyzer/ghidra/OOAnalyzerPlugin
sanneck: is concatenated?
nejintejag: ANE::ProgramCreateInstance probably gives you a program handler????
BiscuitCoin: Neural Engine isn't actually implemented yet.
klasher125: @mag_m3m0ry will that let us see all of the names?
xxxelent: well without context yeah
BotDenhart: Can someone share the lib he has open in Ghidra?
mag_m3m0ry: dont think so
quebono100: He doesnt even share his vimrc :D
Yemtex: @powerofpickle take any compiled open source program
nejintejag: @BotDenhart I tried updating to "Big Sur" to get a copy but my Mac wont let me for some reason.
oubriq: @BotDenhart you can grab firmware/system image at ipsw dot me slash Macmini9,1

Yemtex: yeah twitch is terrible with these ads
menta1backf1ip: @kidumaro
Yemtex: any germans here ? LUL
quebono100: Yeah here =)
oubriq: @mag_m3m0ry I don't think they do ipsws for intel, but the ipsws include x86_64 FAT binaries for libraries. you can get intel mac update binaries elsewhere on apples support site
TheGhostface007: @Yemtex yea wtf is that about the ADS
quebono100: Im from Bavaria, where you from Yemtex?

thx1342: thanks
quebono100: What is he actually trying to achieve?
thx1342: seems to be porting tinygrad to M1
crakeenn: do you prefer iterm or the default terminal for mac
al_onso: but is it the new M1 architecture or the old one
trajenx: IOKit monkaS
Only_Cliches: He’s trying to achieve the singularity
Yemtex: @paradox109 I think I can take that https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odensc/ttv-ublock/extension/chrome/background.js and use it in ublock
thx1342: Ghidra <3

rrdpc: alacritty ftw!
jkfsda: SHOW CHIPS
safetotype: but if your using screen or tmux, the terminal choice isnt really that important
crakeenn: @georgehotz why so you use the default terminal instead of iterm?
afterworktech: stop with the terminal questions. it does not matter
rrdpc: vim is slugish in term and iterm
Yemtex: @paradox109 trying that now https://github.com/odensc/ttv-ublock/tree/main
