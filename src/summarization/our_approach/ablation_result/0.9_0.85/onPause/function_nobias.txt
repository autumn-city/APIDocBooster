 So where onCreate is called when the activity is first created, onPause it's going to be called when you leave the activity. 
whenever a new ACTIVITY starts the previous activity's onPause will be defiantly called in any circumstances. 
onPause is guaranteed to be called on Activity A (No matter whether Activity B is non-full-sized transparent or full-sized). 
onPause()- Screen is partially covered by other new activity. 
onPause() + onStop()- Screen is fully covered by other new activity.
