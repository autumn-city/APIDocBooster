,Java pow implementation with Integer.MIN_VALUE as exponent,<java><pow>,"I am implementing a pow function in Java, and I am wondering how do we deal with Integer.MIN_VALUE as a exponent ? Do we just treat it as a special case ?
Because I tried to compare the result with the standard Java.lang.Math API and I get a couple different result. The following is the list of comparison
[code snippet]
So I am wondering if Integer.MIN_VALUE is a special case where I have to have a if statement for checking it.

,"Rails 4, ruby-2.0.0-p247, pow, rvm - LoadError: cannot load such file -- bundler/setup",<ruby-on-rails><rvm><rack-pow>,"I've been having a bunch of issues with pow all of a sudden and I cannot figure out why. 
I have my app at /path/to/app and symlinked it to pow:
$ cd ~./pow
$ ln -s /path/to/app app_name
I have my app set up with rvm:
$ rvm -v
rvm 1.25.0 (stable)
and my gemset set up with .ruby-version and .ruby-gemset. When I check rvm list and rvm gemset list I do get the right ruby version and gemset specified.

Here is the issue: when I visit app_name.dev/ in browser I get the following error. 
[code snippet]
Now as per the pow trouble shooting guide, I tried 
echo ""export POW_RVM_PATH=/usr/local/rvm/scripts/rvm"" >> ~/.powconfig 
while replacing /usr/local/rvm/ with my rvm installation location and restarted pow. Didn't work. 
I've installed bundler in my global gemset, but didn't fix it:

I also tried uninstalling pow and reinstalling but to no avail. 
I double and triple checked that my app is using the correct version of ruby. 
Additionally, pow works with other apps that I have symlinked.  
Anyone have any thoughts? Thanks in advance.

,Strange behaviour of the pow function,<c><pow>,"While running the following lines of code:  
[code snippet]
I was surprised to see the output, it comes out to be  1 10 99 1000 9999 instead of 1 10 100 1000 10000.  
What could be the possible reason?  
Note
If you think it's a floating point inaccuracy that in the above for loop when i = 2, the values stored in variable a is 99.   
But if you write instead
[code snippet]
now the value of a comes out to be 100. How is that possible?

,"Why isn't `int pow(int base, int exponent)` in the standard C++ libraries?",<c++><math><integer><standard-library><pow>,"I feel like I must just be unable to find it. Is there any reason that the C++ pow function does not implement the ""power"" function for anything except floats and doubles?
I know the implementation is trivial, I just feel like I'm doing work that should be in a standard library. A robust power function (i.e. handles overflow in some consistent, explicit way) is not fun to write.

,why pow(3^47) gives wrong answer?,<php>,"using php, this code echo sprintf('%.9F',pow(3,47)); outputs 26588814358957501972480.000000000

btw, i'd like to know what is the maximum digit php can handle for calculation using pow,sprintf,fmod. Is it 300 digits?

,Why doesn't GCC optimize a*a*a*a*a*a to (a*a*a)*(a*a*a)?,<gcc><assembly><floating-point><compiler-optimization><fast-math>,"I am doing some numerical optimization on a scientific application. One thing I noticed is that GCC will optimize the call pow(a,2) by compiling it into a*a, but the call pow(a,6) is not optimized and will actually call the library function pow, which greatly slows down the performance. (In contrast, [Intel C++ Compiler (hyper-link)], executable icc, will eliminate the library call for pow(a,6).) 
What I am curious about is that when I replaced pow(a,6) with a*a*a*a*a*a using GCC 4.5.1 and options ""-O3 -lm -funroll-loops -msse4"", it uses 5 mulsd instructions:
[code snippet]
while if I write (a*a*a)*(a*a*a), it will produce
[code snippet]
which reduces the number of multiply instructions to 3. icc has similar behavior.
Why do compilers not recognize this optimization trick?
