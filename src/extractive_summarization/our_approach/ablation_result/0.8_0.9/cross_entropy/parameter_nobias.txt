PyTorch's CrossEntropyLoss expects unbounded scores (interpretable as logits / log-odds) as input, not probabilities (as the CE is traditionally defined). 
So the weights are changed to reduce CE and thus finally leads to reduced difference between the prediction and true labels and thus better accuracy.
