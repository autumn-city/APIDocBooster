 So where onCreate is called when the activity is first created, onPause it's going to be called when you leave the activity. 
If you can still see any part of it (Activity coming to foreground either doesn't occupy the whole screen, or it is somewhat transparent), onPause() will be called. 
If you need to save any state in your activity you need to save it in onPause().  onStop() may be called after onPause(), or it may not. Depends on the situation.
 In onPause it could be possible when it is either about to resume a previous activity or it is partially visible but user is leaving the activity.  This is typically considered as the best state to commit unsaved changes to persistent data, stop animations and anything that consumes resources. 
1- a part of previous activity is visible or the new activity is transparent: only onPause will be called.
