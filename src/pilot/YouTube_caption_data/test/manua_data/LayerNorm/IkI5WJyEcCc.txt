theblackknight1_2: yeah expand the dim for the batch
oneil512: Do layer norm
lukeyx88: Cheer100  Hey George, longtime fan from the UK - loved the simulation theory talk you did, what are your thoughts that the double slit experiment maybe just some kind of memory optimization technique outside of the simulation? :D
dalvasorsali: Do these type of models work on any sample rate or do you need to give it the same freq that you trained it on?
theblackknight1_2: you should try for batchnorm @georgehotz  it helps a lot iirc
j4n3sz_: Any books you recommend on neural nets ?
naomieo: glad i could catch a stream!

lasercatboss: can we have some pretrained decoder from a language model to get tokens as output instead?
lukeyx88: @livehoc Hoping to get a response
kadblue: Thats actually kinda sick
machinekob: i think wandb is limiting max request to like few per second
howuhh: well, better to log mean for epoch, not on every step
livehoc: @lukeyx88 The way to get a response is not by asking multiple times lmao
theblackknight1_2: wandb.log() for the val loss maybe
TheLarry17: hello george big fan
lukeyx88: @livehoc He will not see the question if I don't repeat

myaocat: @kubectl how is that a valid syntax?
whurksburner: @Sumrisehd SCRUM is useful. My company uses it
Jeppelelle: There is something on your table that wobbles all the time that mic picks up 🎅
nowrds_: lion’s mane, i haven’t tried shilajit but it’s up there as well
Silensrunners: Scrum is used everywhere
theblackknight1_2: smoothing
nestradalink2: @Sumrisehd  lots of companies uses it.
snowbola: can we make a bot to automatically ban stupid questions please
kubectl: @myaocat he did fic that before, was just to jog memory
AlfredPowerrr: ReduceLRonPlateau
Sumrisehd: k thx
HyperEssy: In the old days, ppl would pay millions to get access to a decent computer... not python btw lol
ActForImpact: @georgehotz nerdgasmNvidia  or nerdgasmAMD ?
myaocat: @kubectl i thought it was function
skankhunt1510: You should add this project to your resume. Will look good
Sumrisehd: @snowbola Then you would've already been banned
boostedcats: you can use librosa
notmap: god!!
HyperEssy: pyaudio is wrapper of portaudio in c
recursivey: yo
theblackknight1_2: librosa afaik
snowbola: @Sumrisehd bruh you're asking about scum to mr hotz. you already know the answer
machinekob: yea librosa probably easiest
RIDDLEguy111: should maybe change streaming category to "software and game development"
TheLarry17: @RIDDLEguy111 no
theblackknight1_2: @RIDDLEguy111 why???
Santiago_LHC: @RIDDLEguy111 never
Ascertainment: this is tech

BeHonestFool: Does bad question mean no stream, thats a lot of power to give chat
Santiago_LHC: We don't want more people asking bad questions
pi_salt_peanuts: Now it’s a nightmare
MrYasser2194: @Ascertainment and software and game development isn't tech?
theblackknight1_2: @georgehotz what architecture is you are using for the nnet, if you are using ctc loss you can use beam search for inference it might improve predictions
HyperEssy: Like I said, pyaudio is a wrapper of portaudio in C
quickcheck: No wheel errors Pog
jjjjjjt8: man hotz should do a ml model to classify good or bad questions lol
TheLarry17: does it help your thinking process when you say everything out loud
machinekob: @jjjjjjt8 true :D
theblackknight1_2: have you tried interactive python notebooks? easier to use than ipynb files
sbrabez: that notebook extension support looks tot awesome in vscode
snowbola: just ban anyone that uses a question mark
theblackknight1_2: just put #% in your python files
HyperEssy: haha did he lose his mind?
machinekob: vscode is best microsoft product by a mile :D
skankhunt1510: @TheLarry17 He probably is only talking to chat

mafio1: what normalize value is that?
dzidzileyla: is he using vscode + vim plugin?
KikoFromTexas: @Bioaim7 LOL
Silensrunners: 2^16 maybe
ProDucks: smash 64
machinekob: its probably int to float range of wav file normalization
notmap: wats wrong with vscode?
KikoFromTexas: where my VIM boys at
skankhunt1510: @snowbola The trick is to convert formulate questions as statements

bradyry773: synthesis voices for audiobooks George!
r3xpow3rs: data normalization on the fly...
mn2197: wait, a GRU and a couple of linear and relu layers .. how is it going to work ???
machinekob: @georgehotz u can use from IPython.display import Audio
BeHonestFool: what was wrong with @schizue message?
theblackknight1_2: hmm he still hasnt added batchnorm
snowbola: NICE
whateverhappns: you can use "from IPython.display import Audio" to play audio from np array in jupyter i think

slev0182: this dude write high level code faster than I can write basic emails :(
ws_popup: @schizue If you ask a streamer "What do you think about ice cubes?" You are most likely not actually asking because u wanna know what x streamer thinks about ice cubes, but more what his response will be, will he call you an idiot? Will he waste 5 minutes answering it?
experimental_warrior: how many nvidias to train that?
Santiago_LHC: PSA: Bad and off topic questions will get you timed out or banned.
diemsond3: was that a marketwatch notification? ;)

softwaretools: like a patriarchy?
ws_popup: @schizue I mean, if i were to ask Geo what he thinks about ice cubes, it would be to figure out what kind of person he is based on what he responds with, idc about the ice cubes
NichtMarlon: converging to the same value :)
Impr0x: what a day, what a lovely day! geohotz is streaming
jagger_rsw: I'm new to ML, what's model? As in, my lame understanding was that we train network to get a model, but geohot uses some model initially and then trains it?
Joooooooooonas: @livehoc you are right but your making the chat worse with writing that stuff
Silensrunners: @experimental_warrior that was more of an inverted exponential LUL

theblackknight1_2: iirc its one of the main methods used
Silensrunners: Yes, dropout is used to turn off a node randomly so it learns different paths to get the proper result afaik
Ansmirnov: do kwon just receiving divine punishment for tempting the gods
lasercatboss: idk dropout seems suspicious, can we decay weights instead
theyawn: lol the mods are active KEKW
jasonheh: what optimizer is he using
theblackknight1_2: why do you think dropout is suspicious @lasercatboss
bradyry773: some of the pricing for speech ai is ridiculous
alexjorgef: @mys3r olá

bradyry773: pyaudio is rubbish
awesomefreak72: yo
bpolhamus13: @theblackknight1_2 Thats the one. Just wondering what it is
theblackknight1_2: its the predictions
theblackknight1_2: basically he has a network that maps input to sequence length, the 0s you see are blank characters and the numbers are mapped to characters in his charset
akotirous: @georgehotz a bit of a random question, but do you think you'll see true AGI in your lifetime?
kilian_de: UTF8 is the future bro
theblackknight1_2: honestly wandb has the best adjective-noun pairs

bpolhamus13: @theblackknight1_2 That makes sense. Thanks.
MrBankster: what u think of kung fu kenny new album?

theblackknight1_2: @bpolhamus13 no problem bro ML is great to study!
bradyry773: this wandb.ai is pretty cool
bradyry773: https://wandb.ai/geohot/tinyvoice/table?workspace=user-
Barakie: How do you know it's not overfitting ?
Tyl3r44: never heard about wandb.ai. i'll check it out
JAKWAI: JAKWAI subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months!
theblackknight1_2: @Barakie  the validation loss is still going down
theblackknight1_2: its overfitting if train loss is going down but validation loss is going up
Timjenkinson32: it's like Siri with brain damage so far
Joooooooooonas: use some filters on your voice, highpass filter and stuff
b1gjr: Yeah I can see it
Barakie: @theblackknight1_2 thanks
bradyry773: speaking like Christopher walken
bpolhamus13: @theblackknight1_2 I keep saying I'll find time for it. My adhd has me messing with UE5 lol
bojosos: Give it more GPU
theblackknight1_2: @bpolhamus13  ML is great for ppl with adhd I think lots of cool little applications to try
B0Bhead: is this the Dropout that kanye wrote about?
grinsepilz: @theblackknight1_2 it's more a curse
bpolhamus13: @theblackknight1_2 Good to know. Thanks a lot stranger.
theblackknight1_2: train till overfit maybe then try the other one till overfitting
kingf66: @georgehotz hey goerg long time fan, i just wanted to ask why you look like the potato head from toystory?
lasercatboss: i really think your mic being different makes this out of distribution, you wouldnt see overfitting
Tyl3r44: why no tensorboard bro
patkarmobile: APUSH? im in class rn
bradyry773: m1 ftw
theblackknight1_2: overkill A100
BeHonestFool: yo favourite, dog breed?
techied: YES
daltonSC2: give it more emotional support
lafolledu36: you need layer norm
j4n3sz_: any books you recommend on neural nets ?
musabkilic0: yes
Tekichan21: no music today?
milkisbad: have u seen data2vec? https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03555
uhhcronikk: Tell it it's a nice model and you're thankful for it.
ruhruhrook: output needs a language model, no?
bradyry773: does it consider accents?
think__tech: Thoughts on you.com? the Richard socher search engine?
mn2197: why not use some sample from the training set itself and see what kind of output we are getting ..
mongo_obi: Gato and dall-e 2?
theblackknight1_2: a100 is 32k
smurfd0: https://hackernoon.com/building-an-end-to-end-speech-recognition-model-in-pytorch-with-assemblyai-5o8s3yry was this the post you looked for?
routerkicker: are a100 going in the new datacenter?
Timjenkinson32: are you planning a use for this?
PhysoTronic: georgehotz have you maybe bought new macbook with new apple cpu? if yes, how do you like it?
mrr0bot_: Data augmentation?
vHyphy: Will you start an NLP based company?
lasercatboss: called it, dropout suspicious
Santiago_LHC: @PhysoTronic There is a stream about it
paranon1: @georgehotz you were looking for a better search engine a while ago - did you ever try https://search.marginalia.nu ?
solvablequintic: using obs on rosetta triggers me because of the energy usage on the activity monitor
penpeq: omg coding steam am I dreaming
PhysoTronic: @PhysoTronic do you maybe know title or approx when did it happen so I can find it?
Joooooooooonas: Did you see that the new rtx series probably will draw like 600W+ @georgehotz
c0smicsag3x: hello
dalvasorsali: it's not changing
PhysoTronic: @Santiago_LHC do you maybe know title or approx when did it happen so I can find it? (this replay is really annoying that I replay to my own message LUL )
jasonheh: I think you're likely under fitting if anything
BeHonestFool: I like his style. Saying he wants to talk to chat then just carry on. Based
bradyry773: i reckon openai is limiting ai growth by keeping everything closed off
Santiago_LHC: @PhysoTronic https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W55PHTX_zb0 and there are like three other streams following that one in that channel
theblackknight1_2: maybe using attention will improve the quality of the model
dustinsomnia: @paranon1 that's one shitty search engine
PhysoTronic: @Santiago_LHC thank you very much
Keyeh: just use transformers bro
Tyl3r44: cool kids use transformers
lasercatboss: we dont have enough data already, please dont transformer it
vHyphy: How will NLP be implemented into the the C3
im_rc01: You should
mn2197: lol
theblackknight1_2: how much data do you got
bradyry773: hugging face transformer haha
jasonheh: conferences should really ban "is all you need" papers
Orped: love the streams, dont think i've seen you life before. thanks for streaming today @georgehotz
Orped: live*
bradyry773: sounds like a pokemon type
daltonSC2: call it fallen gras 6_new
SurfCat: FeelsGoodMan party time
theblackknight1_2: fallen grass untitled
jsnfly: Aren't you calculating gradients for validation as well?
theblackknight1_2: @jsnfly  why doe
jasonheh: do you have multiple GPUs?
bradyry773: how much data in lj?
HyperEssy: Or just call it meaningless it will wrap all those names
theblackknight1_2: why would you need gradients from the validation set
mn2197: ctc is definitely the correct choice here
bradyry773: lj doesnt have enough to overfit surely
estodarr: so what does it mean when it goes from 0 -> 100%?
theblackknight1_2: is tehre another choice? @mn2197
theblackknight1_2: there*
jsnfly: yeah he shouldn't but I don't see torch.no_grad(). But maybe I missed it.
bradyry773: fallen-fire-7
im_rc01: For speech recognition I tried using FairSeq or ConvTransformers
r3mote: Hi all :)
battledroyale: @georgehotz how much of your programming skill do you attribute to hard work vs IQ?
bojosos: Looks like it's IO bound
jsnfly: Ah ok
bradyry773: will it overfit with the lj data?
bradyry773: how much is there
bojosos: Disk utilization 100%?
HyperEssy: Are you build your tinyGrad or is it dead?
theblackknight1_2: 2.6 GB @bradyry773
bradyry773: ah 13,100
im_rc01: Nice
Santiago_LHC: https://github.com/geohot/tinyvoice
BeHonestFool: take over the world?
bradyry773: synthesis books!
bradyry773: richard feynman reading hawking
BarGolan: Sorry for the ignorance, but can you introduce yourself and what are you doing?
Shashwatkthnxbye: ban
ein_echter_depp: derp derp black box neural networks ftw
Santiago_LHC: @BarGolan No. look him up
BeHonestFool: @BarGolan xd
BeHonestFool: Hello class introduce yourselves
sangor: @BarGolan google "george hotz"
im_rc01: you can try deepmind's wavenet
alycia: is this html
TrafalgarLawu: why speech recognition though?
jasonheh: Google annotates it at the phoneme level
theblackknight1_2: so you wanna segment the input properly
darkzade: 5Head
Santiago_LHC: @TrafalgarLawu why not?
theblackknight1_2: ctc loss gives you that right
theydontknowyet: is the input well distributed? (different bitrates/ voices/ etc?)  Also are you normalising your inputs?
BeHonestFool: @jasondesante ah yes the pheromones
TrafalgarLawu: just wondering
bradyry773: cool!
HyperEssy: @TrafalgarLawu It's obvious! Think about what he showed us. The robot... lol he's prob trying to add voice command for his robot
AatishSai: quick question will you be uploading the final trained model to repo as well?
bradyry773: possible to translate to other languages you think?
theblackknight1_2: check tortoise out its insane quality wise
theblackknight1_2: https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts
theblackknight1_2: very recent as well
zwjke123: batchnorm
tom__bob: he's back!
i_rapkin: can we get better results with pre-training on text?
theblackknight1_2: just takes a loooong time to synthesize a clip
TrafalgarLawu: @HyperEssy that makes sense
bradyry773: half this tts repos you can't even run without so much messing around
WeBDaEMoN3: that does sound good
daltonSC2: uses transformers, what a suprise LUL
Consural: that sounds insane
BeHonestFool: damn thats good
im_rc01: https://github.com/vincentherrmann/pytorch-wavenet
Ynifor: so good
bradyry773: yep!
cuddlingusrl: we are indeed here to do party
cuddlingusrl: please make merch
Shashwatkthnxbye: Party YEAHHHHHH
grinsepilz: FeelsBirthdayMan
damacloid: try this tts https://15.ai
theblackknight1_2: tortoise is open source i think
bpolhamus13: haha I love that mindset
WildRhino: FeelsBirthdayMan
zwjke123: people who bought luna are depressed man, on reddit its really sad for them
BeHonestFool: cant it be nice and runable and still a party or no?
tarunadityaselva: hahaha speechify
zwjke123: sme of them
bradyry773: uh oh
ein_echter_depp: neural networks are fucking stupid
WeBDaEMoN3: is this what I'm gonna use to get commabody to go make me a sandwich?
theblackknight1_2: overfitting soon
lasercatboss: sounds like a lot of work to balance the two losses and completely dependent on tuning that
Shashwatkthnxbye: Buy some LUNA bois
alchemixxt: then maybe use the recognizer and synthesizer together in a GAN?
theblackknight1_2: maybe hahaha
HyperEssy: @ein_echter_depp why?
bradyry773: deepmind tts is pretty good i've heard
darushan: what is an example of a good question
Deni1111: hello boss
miketdc: so you want to prepare some autoencoder?
zwjke123: man its depressing on reddit for luna people
BarGolan: I feel completely foreign in this channel, but very intrigued
evanmays: weights and biases has hyper parameter search!
tarunadityaselva: https://www.deepmind.com/publications/end-to-end-adversarial-text-to-speech
im_rc01: RAVDEES is one Dataset
cuddlingusrl: @zwjke123 yep they took a huge risk. Sucks for them and also gotta take a cautious approach with all that
ein_echter_depp: people use neural networks when they have a ton of data and no idea what they are doing. just plug and play and you have something that looks good to your boss but will fail when you deploy.
bradyry773: hugging face
jsnfly: Meta AI has some recent work on this https://ai.facebook.com/blog/textless-nlp-generating-expressive-speech-from-raw-audio/
jokestera_e: What is he running in the terminal?
theblackknight1_2: the code is in the repo its a diffusion model
smurfd0: mozilla has a massive voice dataset
cuddlingusrl: @ein_echter_depp so true. In the music world, AI is everywhere
bradyry773: hugging face taking over everything now didnt they just get 2 bil valuation or something
jasonheh: yeah no one uses neural networks in production Kappa
zwjke123: @ein_echter_depp no not quite true
kadblue: oh no
bradyry773: could be
Shashwatkthnxbye: What's overfitting?
DatHarryGuy: @Shashwatkthnxbye google it
bradyry773: it gets lazy
ein_echter_depp: here is a question -- why would such a technique overfit?
tarunadityaselva: https://www.deepmind.com/publications/end-to-end-adversarial-text-to-speech
zwjke123: the model has to generalize
miketdc: 13k data is not that much i guess
ein_echter_depp: what is the reason overfitting exists?
ein_echter_depp: why does this splitting technique work?
Shashwatkthnxbye: Thanks
daltonSC2: it is memorization essentially
Keyeh: statistics
drewrl3v: double descent is the real rage these days
Consural: overfitting is like when you study for the exam by memorizing everything, but you actually learned nothing.
cuddlingusrl: CAREFUL we're almost to an engineering stream now....
theydontknowyet: is the input well distributed? (bitrates / diff voices / etc etc)
darkzade: information theory has the answer
theblackknight1_2: @georgehotz  tortoise design documentation here https://nonint.com/2022/04/25/tortoise-architectural-design-doc/
Bioaim7: overfitting exists, because there is not REAL AI
cursedbuddy: think about it like memorizing the questions before a math test
darushan: overfitting is when you wear a turtleneck that is too tight
UserNameThe3rd: Because of maths
lasercatboss: generalization is a lie
HyperEssy: @ein_echter_depp Well this is the idea of learning by data... which extracting the function... creating a function could be very hard... if you can, then do it!
kubectl: Memorization is easier than understanding :)
cuddlingusrl: @darushan lol
Santiagolarrain: Great explanation
mongo_obi: It’s cramming vs learning
Acandias: exactly LUL
daltonSC2: @Bioaim7 that's not true, humans could "overfit" too
Shashwatkthnxbye: Gotcha
i_rapkin: Here good text about overfitting https://karpathy.github.io/2019/04/25/recipe/#3-overfit
jeemjam: overfitting is for cool kids, double descent is poggers
bradyry773: recommend everyone watch alphago - quality
miketdc: @kubectl depends on number of samples and data complexity but pretty much yes
bradyry773: deepmind documentary
BeHonestFool: Awareness LULE
theblackknight1_2: haha he used sketches mustve been a passion project
Supgoku: your favorite activation function?
Shashwatkthnxbye: Is it true you failed a science class in middle school?
zwjke123: if you know the all information in the universe, overfitting would not occure for a NN
Bioaim7: @daltonSC2 that's not false
Acandias: overfitting used to be OP in history exams.
Deni1111: i overfit all the time
Joooooooooonas: I feel like in your voice is a lot lower frequency maybe its because of that
ein_echter_depp: its because the model is over powered. it can shatter the dataset. the vc dimension of the algo is too large.
ontologicaltofu: can this help with overfitting? https://github.com/LiyuanLucasLiu/APART
sw1jari: didn't you make the model bigger?
マーシャリティ: @georgehotz hi there! can u recommend some literature about reinforcement learning? and may be something useful which somehow similar to OpenAI hide and seek video? thank you in advance
bradyry773: goodreads
ein_echter_depp: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/182685/why-is-vc-dimension-important
bradyry773: 2 minute papers too
UnknownGreek: Can you describe a little the spectogram and why you believe its worse now?
zwjke123: how all of you read papers?
xksteven: what are we building speech recognition for?
mrr0bot_: Does that model can recognize the son it was called the cold War ?
bradyry773: hi youtube
smile_ix: How to flip waterbottle?
routerkicker: @UnknownGreek he's looking at the text it generated not the spectrum
theblackknight1_2: https://nonint.com/2022/04/25/tortoise-architectural-design-doc/ in case you still asking for it
HyperEssy: @zwjke123 Nowdays papers are very bad... it's competition of complex words... useless
lasercatboss: i dont trust it, can we even overfit it?
ein_echter_depp: neural networks are quite dangerous for applications that actually matter to people's health and safety. the problem of vc dimension mismatch is a huge one.
UnknownGreek: @routerkicker ty mate
マーシャリティ: @georgehotz hi there! can u recommend some literature about reinforcement learning? and may be something useful which somehow similar to OpenAI hide and seek video? thank you in advance
estodarr: why don't you post more on your insta smh
miketdc: what proportion do you use for train / dev / test?
jokestera_e: Are you back finally??
jirikmarik: was fun
jokestera_e: I'll sub if you do
Consural: aww
BeHonestFool: Stupid question xd
Shashwatkthnxbye: pls stream again
Santiago_LHC: Good questions please
theblackknight1_2: anytime bro
sangor: thank you for the stream
i_rapkin: waiting is the worst
zwjke123: how you read papers
serotta_cyclist: Thanks for stream!
bradyry773: could you push the changes? To read
smile_ix: work is good and fun!
zhigalivan: @georgehotz Thank's man!
Shashwatkthnxbye: For the love of god stream
dzidzileyla: xD
mafio1: were you happy with the chat today?
Bioaim7: humans ar the biggest threat ye
tyler__miller: How you liking the Kia EV-6?
ecal_: he is dangerous to applications that actually matter
Impr0x: take care man, hope to see you again here @georgehotz
Ynifor: that was fun, hope to see you later
vHyphy: How will NLP be implemented into C3
theblackknight1_2: this is why NLP research is still an active field I guess
Deni1111: if you think that you need to kill yourself
dustinsomnia: LUL
battledroyale: @georgehotz have you met Elon?
WeBDaEMoN3: a watched tensorboard never converges
HyperEssy: He means a probabilistic approach rather than deterministic...
Deni1111: couse you are a neural network
dustinsomnia: I like watching it train LUL
Ynifor: that's fine for me
lasercatboss: look, the gradients gotta do what the gradients gotta do, lets keep it  training for a bit
jokestera_e: You cann't run the trianing on a server?
daltonSC2: play Tetris while it trains
Joooooooooonas: Just buy more hardware then we dont have to wait LUL
jsnfly: Just use something pretrained and play with that?
theblackknight1_2: I mean theres a lot to talk about while it trains
emilwallin: IS THE UNIVERSE DETERMINISTIC OR NOT FFS?
damacloid: Loss spikes occur when the model becomes sentient
zwjke123: thoughts of tensorflow lite?
kubectl: Train multiple versions of the same model at the same time
bradyry773: TPU would be sweet
deanfx: Sup man! Been a while since I've seen you on :) Hope you're doing well
theblackknight1_2: code ->train ->code while training
Shashwatkthnxbye: ITS WAKING UP
kubectl: do some hyper parameter tuning e.g. automl
tarunadityaselva: training time = rant time
Consural: @emilwallin read chaos theory
atwozie: how would u describe ur life in 3 sentences?
theblackknight1_2: play beat saber why it trains
mafio1: what you need is a cherry gpu :D
zwjke123: code a bolzmann brain
emilwallin: @Consural ok
battledroyale: does anyone know George's IQ?
kubilaylay: 69
Quev1337: 140
mafio1: 1337
Shashwatkthnxbye: 69
Acandias: honestly the time I've wasted on training models is depressing
zwjke123: 420
dustinsomnia: @battledroyale IQ doesn't matter
マーシャリティ: @georgehotz can u recommend something to read about reinforcement learning? and may be something useful which somehow similar to OpenAI hide and seek video? thank you in advance
bepoiaa1yt: thanks for streaming, I hope we can see you in future more live streaming but at the end, it's your decision.
daltonSC2: @battledroyale APM is the only metric that matters
Nikola_432: @georgehotz any books you can recommend?
theblackknight1_2: @battledroyale hahaha yeeep
Shashwatkthnxbye: just do it bro
zwjke123: man george you overfit
Joooooooooonas: more gpus more gpus xqcCheer xqcCheer xqcCheer
dicapz: What gets you up in the morning George. I’m depressed and burnt out of coding /working
battledroyale: his IQ is probably 142. no troll.
Robster1919: Hi George! I'm a big fan of your OnlyFans content! Can we get more auto-generated feet pics next time? Thanks!
HyperEssy: Anything in python will be slow
recursivey: not coding volume traces
daltonSC2: are you using the cudnn GRU?
musabkilic0: Disk Utilization 100%
zwjke123: you play any games?
Shashwatkthnxbye: Noob Programming Lesson #2 when? @georgehotz
dustinsomnia: IQ is a false indicator of intelligence
bradyry773: the training time and gpu usage is what stops advancements alot of the time. It who can pay the most so it ends up being big companies like google and not actual innovators
Joooooooooonas: more gpus more gpus xqcCheer xqcCheer xqcCheer
Robster1919: @dustinsomnia keep coping buddy
HyperEssy: Noob MLers do python. True MLers do C.
peugeot_exalt: do you have crypocurrencies? or are you programming cryptocurrencies? @georgehotz
zwjke123: depends on the dataset size
estodarr: @peugeot_exalt leave
recursivey: an array with three objects is slower than three objects themselves
battledroyale: IQ is CPU speed
deanfx: You prefer a mac?
Shashwatkthnxbye: George you said you wanted to do something like Shkreli but for CS
daltonSC2: @dustinsomnia like saying bmi is a false indication of weight.
dustinsomnia: @Robster1919 yeah I'll keep up with reality
peugeot_exalt: can a mod ban estodarr
lasercatboss: replace number with power of 2 until fast
KhalJonSnow: @HyperEssy i do ml i assembly
emilwallin: when will george appear on joe rogan, it needs to happen asap!!
Deni1111: can you not thread this
estodarr: @peugeot_exalt no
Robster1919: @dustinsomnia touch grass buddy
darushan: my IQ is below average, am I stupid? :(
peugeot_exalt: i'll block estodarr
zwjke123: do you play any games?
Ansmirnov: nice :)
HyperEssy: @KhalJonSnow That's worse than C since C's optimizer is better than most humans
Joooooooooonas: nice

WeBDaEMoN3: nice
mvargasmoran: nice
peugeot_exalt: i remember your ps3 rap on youtube
knicked: nice
dustinsomnia: @Robster1919 why would I do that
Consural: best model
dustinsomnia: ?
Shashwatkthnxbye: FREESTYLE RAP
battledroyale: I change my answer. George's IQ is 169.
11plus4thinking: is that jupyter notebook poggers
VennKoan: have you ever used Jax? some people say they can't go back to pytorch after trying it. @georgehotz
bradyry773: wow this is slow
HyperEssy: @battledroyale lol
zwjke123: do you validate youre model
thuganalyst: We missed you fam
Shashwatkthnxbye: Chat took an absolute dump once he said stream is over
jokestera_e: @11plus4thinking ya vscode has an extention for it
zwjke123: fast == batch norm
dustinsomnia: ask george. he will tell you IQ is a false indicator of intelligence
11plus4thinking: @jokestera_e yea but isn't it kinda shit in vs
11plus4thinking: thats what I heard
lasercatboss: you can probably cut of the higher frequencies in the input
jokestera_e: he seems to like it
i_rapkin: lower bitrate
paelvoid: Imagine saying a model going through epochs this quickly is still too slow, at my job each epoch takes several hours
sliderspy: If there only was a way to use the viewer's cpu power, like a botnet, so we could help with training
schizue: iq is useful for generalizing on large pops, but not individuals
primedotcpp: hey george! i just needed to see you right now it lifted my day
droopa: OMG
11plus4thinking: @jokestera_e yea but has he tried the other version LUL
droopa: he's back
bradyry773: gpu share on twitch that would be quality
Joooooooooonas: more gpus more gpus xqcCheer xqcCheer xqcCheer
zwjke123: how you read papers?
i_rapkin: lower bitrate
11plus4thinking: just buy better pc 4Head
ezpog: sumFast
daltonSC2: time being sequential is really irritating. We should really make time parallel
Ambadrant: @zwjke123 you read the abstract
paelvoid: Is everything on the GPU
estodarr: salesforce LUL
mafio1: what does pin memory do
11plus4thinking: @mafio1 pins your memory
darushan: hmm maybe the salesforce dataloader will be faster than torch's
think__tech: Run a profiler?
HyperEssy: @schizue bs... iq was a test developed to selectively kill ppl... called eugenics
Wilbo007: hey there i like guacamole guacamole holy moly guacamole
zwjke123: @Ambadrant well there are techniques
m_e_l_o___: HeyGuys
schizue: @HyperEssy Jebaited
bradyry773: donate gpu for george
richmitchw: xqcHYPERF xqcDUD
think__tech: I faced a similar issue, profiling revealed a lot
HyperEssy: @schizue https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#IQ_testing_and_the_eugenics_movement_in_the_United_States
Tornyl: hello
B0tch: whats your setup like, macbook + monitor??
bradyry773: so slow
alexman31459: @georgehotz ML question: can your validation loss be lower than your training loss? Is that possible?
dustinsomnia: exactly
sangor: LUL
11plus4thinking: machine learning is just a synonym for statistics
Impr0x: exactly!
DrunkCrow: thoughts on toes?
theblackknight1_2: XD
mvargasmoran: hahahah xD
Shashwatkthnxbye: oops
primedotcpp: GlitchCat  hey geohotz
11plus4thinking: prove me wrong
freiheitswag: do you have a language model?
11plus4thinking: ya cant!
damacloid: why does text coherency drop over time?
theblackknight1_2: @11plus4thinking hmmm
riccardodm97: don't do .cuda(), put it on GPU directly when you create the tensors to speed it up
mvargasmoran: add value, or get out! BibleThump
lasercatboss: just cut the high frequencies reduce input size we good
theblackknight1_2: you sure its running on the cuda device
bradyry773: google colab with tpu ha
11plus4thinking: just download more wam
11plus4thinking: from the server
richmitchw: @mvargasmoran xqcHYPERF
theblackknight1_2: google colab tpus are on a free resource basis
11plus4thinking: google colab sucks
B0tch: why is the resolution so huge is he using monitor or streaming from laptop?
bradyry773: nothing wrong with google colab ha
think__tech: Maybe a profiler could help? Else we could try some torch.distributed. that has helped a lot sometimes, given the data and model are in the right format, which they seem to be
bradyry773: free!
ako_freshman: what prog lang is this
Shashwatkthnxbye: he literally doesn't read the good questions
richmitchw: if it's free, you are the product
Shashwatkthnxbye: or suggestions
i_rapkin: you can try to find what's slow https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/profiler_recipe.html
bradyry773: true
darushan: @bradyry773 I pay $50 a month for it xqcDespair
dustinsomnia: @Shashwatkthnxbye imagine reading the whole entire chat while coding
11plus4thinking: @Shashwatkthnxbye who are you to decide whats good or not
alexman31459: any planned Solidity streams?
richmitchw: @darushan xqcL
bradyry773: not bad
droopa: why 2 space vs 4 space indent? xD
riccardodm97: don't do .cuda(), put it on GPU directly when you create the tensors to speed it up
B0tch: @droopa he is psycho lol
sw1jari: 4 space takes up so much space
Shashwatkthnxbye: don't do .cuda(), put it on GPU directly when you create the tensors to speed it up
マーシャリティ: @georgehotz can u please recommend something to read about reinforcement learning? and may be something useful which somehow similar to OpenAI hide and seek video to understand how it works? thank you in advance!

ShredderSherlock: break it into smaller pieces
lawlster_1337: Had to do a double take, thought it was a weed plant in the background lol
マーシャリティ: @theblackknight1_2 yeah sorry but what can I do D:
theblackknight1_2: go google it lol @マーシャリティ
11plus4thinking: give your pc a kick
TheLarry17: @マーシャリティ just read something at this point stop spamming
11plus4thinking: it usually works
brickeyy: @dddilly we aren't complaining 🤷
11plus4thinking: just like a horse
マーシャリティ: @theblackknight1_2 you really think that I didn't google?
Joooooooooonas: @マーシャリティ he wont answer that, there are everytime like 10 people asking that question in the stream
11plus4thinking: it runs faster
11plus4thinking: trust Kappa
smurfd0: still, faster though, right
darushan: @Shashwatkthnxbye do you have link to an example of what you mean?
theblackknight1_2: ok, what did google tell you
mafio1: he wont answer those type of questions
paelvoid: but now you have to redo the cache every time
deep5: Pog
jokestera_e: just go to reddit ask the same qustion I"m sure there is a a sub reddit that answers that
richmitchw: Broadcaster absent SourPls Broadcaster absent SourPls Broadcaster absent SourPls
dustinsomnia: george said ask good questions. he did not say he will be answering them at all LUL
bradyry773: my man had too much iced tea

B0tch: @Vesh interesting I can barely see the code
droopa: @B0tch think he has the 5k apple monitor
theblackknight1_2: if you dont like that hands on course, you can read the book by sutton and barto, regarded as the bible for that stuff but its pretty dense
Joooooooooonas: will you let it run while you do other stuff ?
bradyry773: could you push the changes to read?
sw1jari: are you letting it train for some time?
jokestera_e: @マーシャリティ look up your question on reddit there will either be a sub on it or a sub will have a wiki with books that would help
bradyry773: ah cheers

thuganalyst: I'm sure this has been asked before but what is this for? Are you adding some speech rec features to Eon?
Fatsack44: so is he making something similar to cortana?
ws_popup: @thuganalyst Im probably wrong, but i think he is working on https://github.com/geohot/tinyvoice
Silensrunners: How much does the DS weigh?
darnfish: Hi george

r3ndd: @j0sheezy got wrecked by ust
Silensrunners: # This is a comment
j0sheezy: god damn , i just made a useless comment
thuganalyst: Have mercy on us commenters we're trying our best
malateman: one persons noise is another person's signal
bigbawsboy: Librosa
bigbawsboy: Or soundfile
NatelBeats: thank you
ws_popup: Can we define "Useless comments"?
ws_popup: so we don't do it
liird: EZ SteerR
zup_zup: is that what you say to your employees?
lnau: have you ever used vscode's remote / ssh capabilities?

Santiago_LHC: @ws_popup The bar is not high: No off topic crap
thuganalyst: 16 thousand
rick_jamezzz: @zup_zup Yea he probably does talk to them like that
malateman: business people love noise
evanmays: @lnau he's using it rn I think

tanmoyio: Missed yesterday’s stream, is it a transformer based model?
0xBADBADBAD: whatever happens to writing longer, more descriptive variable names, George?
rick_jamezzz: dictionary comprehensions >
romebop: @slev0182 ya i like to pretend i understand what george is doing because it makes me feel smart
ws_popup: @slev0182 Shouldnt be a problem understanding it, his naming is rather good
shrek_361: Moving the dataset to the gpu memory increases training times?
malateman: @slev0182 no, but i'll probably stay for only a bit and wait for the VOD if i want to practice/learn from it
dubsisneat: Datagram does speech to text via spectrum analysis in a neural net, so it should be possible.
brett1479: I knew
hFactorial: F
Icaro_sama: me
romebop: don't forget the F!
Silensrunners: Kappa /

tanmoyio: There are so many start up which are built upon STT, TTS technologies, George is making fun of them
thuganalyst: Bruh how do you make a TTS startup like have they ever heard of Github
ImpactChats: George! PogChamp
ontologicaltofu: Is the meta variable in the your code have to do with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, or does it mean something else?

tanmoyio: George is it a based on transformer? I missed yesterday’s stream
hFactorial: what's "the model"? is it a neural net?
Silensrunners: Preprocessing the input and do Style Transfer from her voice
CEOChillton: I'm self taught in python, I used speech recognition and google's text2speech for a project but I want something like this, is there a writeup on all these steps?
Mlewii: fuckin hell cortana still cant recognize shit for years right for years so we're here to write some competing stuff right Kappa Kappa
mongo_obi: Pretty sure its on geohot GitHub
CEOChillton: thx
Santiago_LHC: https://github.com/geohot/tinyvoice
mongo_obi: No worries man
musashhhi: omg I miss this stream
thuganalyst: For real I can't believe how bad some speech rec from billion dollar companies is. Google's is pretty good but other than that they all kinda suck
thuganalyst: Trillion dollar companies even*
pomprocks: i dont know. they are all pretty good
Mlewii: @thuganalyst amen to that
oMYTHRA: yea Siri sucks lol
bob_the_lonely_turtle: member microsoft dragon naturallyspeaking? lol it was so bad
Silensrunners: I believe speach recognition is fine, but they suck on determining the Intent
pomprocks: i think understanding intent is a bit more complex than just recognizing the words
SkywardDev: What’s the machines ur SSH’d into
Silensrunners: @pomprocks several magnitudes more complex, yes
thuganalyst: does anyone else find they tend to speak differently than a normal speaking voice when interacting with speech systems?
Mlewii: so what we saying is hard about speech recg chat? is it yet another slap an nn into it problem?
nowrds_: last night i asked siri what condoms are made out of and she gave me a "one moment" and i'm still waiting
musashhhi: what did you think of the lex fridman interview with the qualcomm ceo?
pomprocks: id love to see someone build a dwitter generator
muojo: you already have batch_first=True
Longboolean: gpt3 is better at intent but even it fails hard in some pretty funny ways
halirutan: @georgehotz Why do you use 2d conv for a audio signal?
chowzor: Height would be amplitude, width freq, and time would be the 3rd dim
perronsaurio: no mic?
chowzor: but I think that is what you meant
tanmoyio: I am wondering how it will perform if we train the model on YouTube audios against subtitles
ogxsabs: Hesss backkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm Kreygasm
Strackhs: it's [] not ()

oDraftz: He can make the file executable and tell bash how to execute, ie with python
oDraftz: less typing
gdawwg16: My god how long has this man been streaming
thuganalyst: @sngbd_ "./" just denotes current directory
chowzor: Do you want the convolution to cross time buckets? or stay in frequncy space?
LEXINGTONSTEELEROBLOX: are you going to get somewhat involved with the technovillage?
SentientDev: geodad
tanmoyio: I don’t know what loss you are using, but you might like this https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.12511.pdf
sngbd_: @oDraftz I see, I just know that by now
lucasgandara17: Hey Heorge!
lucasgandara17: big fan
ninedao: I've been wondering why all progress on voice recognition for Google, Alexa etc. seems to have stalling since a few years, anybody have an idea?
ninedao: *stalled
theadamsabra: @ninedao All papers are plauged by overoptimizing on standard benchmark datasets in my opinion
theadamsabra: So progress is generally trivial for the sake of publishing papers. Common in ASR and TTS
tanmoyio: @ninedao because everyone is interested in bigger models, like transformers. Everyone is building billion Params model,
Santiago_LHC: Not that one
jessiemvg: Dude’s just speed running intense code like it’s nothing

th3_maj0r: oh, ok
riccardodm97: you can use a bottleneck res block with 1x1 conv which is faster
peezy56: Res block?
VennKoan: Double check param order?
brickeyy: its because its python Kappa
jessiemvg: C = 16?
