Applies the Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) function element-wise. Tanh is defined as: [function]

Tanh function squashes a real-valued number to the range [-1, 1], and is known as the hyperbolic tangent. In PyTorch library, it operates in an elementwise manner, that is, it applies tanh to each element in the tensor being processed. It is important to note that the outcome of the Tanh function can be used to make predictions or classifications in the case of neural networks.

Parameter: Input:(∗), where ∗ means any number of dimensions. Output:(∗), same shape as the input.

Each element in the input tensor will be transformed independently. As such, the number of dimensions in the tensor does not impact the operation of the Tanh function. The output tensor will have the same size and shape as the input tensor, with each individual element being transformed.

Notes: None

The PyTorch Tanh function is not restricted by specific hardware or operating system dependencies. This function is GPU-accelerated which may lead to vast improvements in processing time, especially for large computations. It can be easily implemented within neural network models and it works in conjunction with other PyTorch functions and classes.
