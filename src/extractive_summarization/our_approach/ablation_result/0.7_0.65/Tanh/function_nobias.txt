 The Tanh function is then used to fit the value between -1 and 1. 
 While Tanh fits the input value between -1 and 1, this Sigmoid fits the input value between 0 and 1. 
 Alright, guys let's discuss hyperbolic tangent activation function which is also known as tanh activation function.  Unlike the Sigmoid function, the range for tanh function is -1 to 1.  So it is similar to Sigmoid function, where we were catering the output in a range of 0 to 1 & setting up the threshold at 0.5. so in tanh we extend the lower side of the curve till negative 1 & our mid will be at 0.  So guys by definition tanh function is derived from the trigonometric function that's why it's formula is written as tanh(x) = sinh(x) divided by cosh(x).  A general problem with both the sigmoid and tanh functions is that they saturate.  This means that large values snap to 1.0 and small values snap to -1 or 0 for tanh and sigmoid respectively. 
In truth both tanh and logistic functions can be used.  The idea is that you can map any real number ( [-Inf, Inf] ) to a number between [-1 1] or [0 1] for the tanh and logistic respectively.
First-order derivative: tanh'(z) = 1 - ([exp(z) - exp(-z)] / [exp(z) + exp(-z)])^2 = 1 - tanh^2(z)
