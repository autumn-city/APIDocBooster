Here's a solution to your specific case, which should help getting started on a more general solution (this will work for strings of the form 'cos^X(Y)' where X is some digits and Y is an arithmetic expression):
Define a function called cos^3, insert backticks into the original string around it and evaluate.
cos expects radians, you are giving it degrees.
So you get cos(foo) = 0 and sin(foo) = 1 (what you expected?)
cos(PI/2) = 0, not 1.
ⅈx = cos(π/2*x) + ⅈ*sin(π/2*x)
cos(θ) = ℜ(ⅈ^2θ/π)
How can you calculate powers of ⅈ without sin and cos?
For example, to find sin and cos of 72° = 0.8π/2:
cos(72°) ≈ 0.3078496400415349 ("exact" value is 0.30901699437494745).
To find asin and acos, you can use this table with the Bisection Method:
If we stop here, we obtain acos(0.6) ≈ 13/32*π/2 = 0.6381360077604268  (The "exact" value is 0.6435011087932844.)
Here's my arccos code:
Frankly, though, if you're really pressed for time, remember that you could linearize arccos into 3.14159-1.57079x and just do:
Anyway, if you want to see a list of my arccos approximation equations, you can go to [https://www.desmos.com/calculator/tcaty2sv8l (hyper-link)] I know that my approximations aren't the best for certain things, but if you're doing something where my approximations would be useful, please use them, but try to give me credit.
[nVidia has some great resources (hyper-link)] that show how to approximate otherwise very expensive math functions, such as: [acos (hyper-link)]
[asin (hyper-link)]
[atan2 (hyper-link)]
etc etc...
Here's their acos function:
And here are the results for when calculating acos(0.5):
You can approximate the inverse cosine with a polynomial [as suggested by dan04 (hyper-link)], but a polynomial is a pretty bad approximation near -1 and 1 where the derivative of the inverse cosine goes to infinity.
Here is [a plot (hyper-link)] (the inverse cosine in black, cubic polynomial approximation in red, the above function in blue) for comparison:
The error in the reciprocal approximation is negligible in comparison with the error in the acos approximation.
On a 2.6 GHz Skylake i7, this approximation can do about 8 inverse cosines every 6 cycles using AVX.
A fast arccosine implementation, accurate to about 0.5 degrees, can be based on the  [observation (hyper-link)] that for x in [0,1], acos(x) ≈ √(2*(1-x)).
Negative arguments are handled according to acos (-x) = π - acos (x).
As jonrsharpe mentioned in his comment, COS stands for Carousel Object System, but to explain more...
From [In Defense of COS, or Why I Love JSON and Hate XML (hyper-link)]:
COS stands for Carousel Object System and refers to the original/code name for Adobe’s Acrobat product.
The format is a subset of a COS ("Carousel" Object Structure) format.
[cos(0.321139585333178 degrees) (hyper-link)] = 0.999984292
[cos(0.321139585333178 radians) (hyper-link)] = 0.948876326
It is a bug in algorithm='maxima', so use algorithm='mathematica_free' (def new function to find definite integral) or simplify_full() for such product of cos(kx) and than integrate.
Cosinus of 90 degrees is 0.
The result is the same up to 15 decimal places, I suspect that is sufficient for almost all applications and if you require more you should probably be implementing your own version of cosine anyway such that you are in control of the specifics and your code is portable across different C compilers.
As cosine is defined as an infinite series of terms an approximation must be used for its software implementation.
To make things worse, and according to [@R (hyper-link)], IEEE 754 tolerates error in the last bit when using the cosine function.
According to [the documentation (hyper-link)], Asin and Acos definitely return in radians.
cos-1 means the inverse function of cos.
It does not mean cos raised to the power -1.
Asin and Acos return the angle in [Radians (hyper-link)], you have to convert it to Degrees.
To use cos inverse in C# try using Math.Acos() method, It returns the angle whose cosine is the specified number.
In C, cos is double precision and cosf is single precision.
In C++, std::cos has overloads for both double and single.
You aren't calling std::cos.
If <cmath> doesn't also overload ::cos (as far as I know, it is not required to), then you are just calling the C double precision function.
If this is the case, then you're suffering the cost of converting between float, double, and back.
Now, some standard libraries implement cos(float x) as (float)cos((double)x), so even if you are calling the float function it might still be doing conversions behind the scenes.
So it is impossible to match the first cos.
It matches the next cos because it captures the space as well (which satisfies the negative lookahead).
If you want to allow digits to be placed in the front as well (like 4cos(2)), you could for instance use:
Use the [Python builtin map function (hyper-link)] to apply sympy.cos to each element in the list:
These are ambiguous because there are two version of cos, which these two types:
cos(0 as Double)
cos(0.0) because direct use of a floatliteral as a Double takes precedence over a conversion via expressiblebyfloatliteral.
If you want the Float version, you can call it with: cos(0 as Float)
cos is 1 for every even multiple of pi radians.
M_PI/M_PI is 1.0 (as a Double), so these cases are equivalent to the first, but with the extra type information necessary to allow the compiler to unambiguously choose (Double) -> Double cos over (Float) -> Float.
As @paxdiablo mentioned, there's just too many lines of information, so a way to fix that is by removing endl and adding \t for degree, sin and cos as follows, the following code displays all the required information as I checked.
It looks like cos driver is not properly initialized.
This works with swift2d and cos scheme.
Stocator is on the classpath for Spark 2.0 and 2.1 kernels, but the cos scheme is not configured.
I recommend that you raise a feature request against DSX to support the cos scheme.
The latest version of Stocator (v1.0.9) that supports fs.cos scheme is not yet deployed on Spark aaService (It will be soon).
Please use the stocator scheme "fs.s3d" to connect to your COS.
You have to set .config("spark.hadoop.fs.stocator.scheme.list", "cos") along with some others fs.cos... configurations.
Looks like Julia's acos requires a complex argument for a complex output.
If you make those two changes, then the result of cos(Math.PI / 6, 10) is 0.8660254037844386 which seems correct to me.
You can calculate cos(1) by using the Taylor expansion of this function:
EDIT: Apparently the cosine is implemented in hardware using the [CORDIC (hyper-link)] algorithm that uses a lookup table to calculate atan.
The polynomials obviously diverge from a function like cos(x) because they all go towards infinity at some point, while cos doesn't.
Since 50 * 2pi << 1000, your polynomial can't approximate cos(1000).
Instead, use the periodicity of cos(x) and add the following as the first line of your function:
You're taking the cos of 45 degrees (converted to radians) and multiplying it by 100, and the cos of 45 degrees (or pi/4 radians) is 0.7071067, and so the expected value to print out is 70.7106.
SIN and COS functions take the arguments in radians.
This happens in some versions of COS;
There's no driver listed below [gpu] and running cos-extensions install gpu ends in the same way as in your case.
If you can use some older version of COS (85-13310 for example) - the driver is listed:
And when you run cos-extensions install gpu it will result in succesfull installation of NVIDIA drivers:
The parameter n in float cos(int n , float x) is the l and now just do it...
Consider that cos returns the following (sorry for the dots position) :
= 1, so calling cos(1, x) gets you the first MAX terms of the Taylor expansion of cos.
For n > 0, you do in cos(n-1, x) a division by (2n-3)(2n-2) of the previous result, and a multiplication by x².
If you allow yourself helper functions, then you should change the signature of the above to float cos_helper(int n, float x, int MAX) and call it like so :
float cos(int n, float x) { return cos_helper(1, x, n); }
Let us define trivially cos(0,x) = 0 and cos(1,x) = 1, and try to achieve generally cos(n,x) the sum of the n first terms of the Taylor series.
Then for each n > 0, we can write, cos(n,x) from cos(n-1,x) :
cos(n,x) = cos(n-1,x) + x2n / (2n)!
now for n > 1, we try to make the last term of cos(n-1,x) appear (because it is the closest term to the one we want to add) :
cos(n,x) = cos(n-1,x) + x² / ((2n-1)2n) * ( x2n-2 / (2n-2)! )
cos(n,x) = cos(n-1,x) + x² / ((2n-1)2n) * ( cos(n-1,x) - cos(n-2,x) )
We now have a purely recursive definition of cos(n,x), without helper function, without recomputing the factorial, and with n the number of terms in the sum of the Taylor decomposition.
performance wise, unless some optimization allows to not re-evaluate a cos(n-1,x) that was evaluated at the previous step as cos( (n-1) - 1, x)
Math is a class, Cos() is a static method belonging to that class.
sin & cos are not functions that are built into vba.
They are, however, built into excel and can be accessed through the $WorksheetFunction$ object of vba as $WorksheetFunction.Sin$ and $WorksheetFunction.Cos$.
I had to add Imports System.Math at the top to make the compiler recognise Sin, Cos etc.
(I don't know why it would "run fine" with cos() moved out of the for loop, but this explanation is not very clear on your part.
If you get an undefined reference for cos() in one part of the program, you should get it in a different part as well, if the compiler options are the same in both cases.)
You have to set .config("spark.hadoop.fs.stocator.scheme.list", "cos") along with some others fs.cos... configurations.
Set configuration information in scala (my COS location is us-east):
[code snippet]
First of all, a cosine of 180 degrees should be equal to -1, so the result you got is right.
Secondly, you sometimes can't get exact values when using sin/cos/tan etc functions as you always get results that are the closest to the correct ones.
C/C++ provides sin(a), cos(a), tan(a), etc.
OP's code with 180 passed to  DegreesToRadians(d) and then to sin()/cos() gives results that differ than expected due to rounding, finite precision of double() and possible a weak value for PI.
My solution is to use the new math.h functions __cospi() and __sinpi().
Performance is similar (even 1% faster) than cos() and sin().
But for large x, 1/cosh(x) is effectively 0, so the roots are approximately the same as cos(x) = 0, which are pi/2 + pi*k, any integer k.
Negating an angle will negate its sine, but leave its cosine unchanged.
acos() and other mathematical functions from the BSD library can be used directly from Swift.
Trying to optimize sin() and cos() (that are already optimized to the hilt) won't gain you much.
the other operations are going to take up time that is comparable to sin and cos. Did you run the profiler by splitting up the expression into its constituents?
That should give you an idea of how much the relative cost of sin() and cos() is.
Is equivalent to a= cos(120) that is the result of cos(120) is 0.8141 and being a integer type "a" will only store the integer part it.
One issue is that you declared integers, yet you are using them in the call to cos here:
Since a is an integer, the return value of cos (which is of type double) will be truncated.
this here:  acos(-1) look peculiar in your equation, you don't need the acos of -1 pi radians...
cos(x)^(-1) is the same as 1/cos(x) or just sec(x)
you need to write this  A=cos^(-1)⁡((b^2+c^2-a^2)/2bc)  properly
if you mean the inverse function of cos(x) aka acos(x) then the argument -1 is not correct in your equation
Note that the arccos will not solve your problem because it will return only angles in the 1st and 2nd quadrants.
two identical references) but "sin"(or "cos",etc) and amalgar are always two different objects.
When you need both, always compute the sin and cos of a value at the same time.
Have you tried benchmarking it against Math.Cos(), or other methods of approximating trig functions (you can get very good approximations with a few simple multiplications using [Taylor Series (hyper-link)])
One thing you could try would be to use the fact that cos(x) = sin(x + pi/2).
And make the sine table one quarter larger, so you can reuse it as the cosine table starting one quarter in.
cos(x) = sin(pi/2-x).
cos is in math module (as well as other mathematical libraries like numpy etc.)
I got both the function in javascript Math.sin(x) and Math.cos(x).
When the variable demoivre is true, complex exponentials are converted into equivalent expressions in terms of circular functions: exp (a + b*%i) simplifies to %e^a * (cos(b) + %i*sin(b)) if b is free of %i.
An old but good recurrence relation for sin/cos interpolation described [here (hyper-link)].
Just paste the string cos⁻¹ into your button title, label, or other view with text content.
After applying that change and compiling your program I used it to compute cos(3.141593) = -1.000004, which is correct.
You could Also use two lookup tables on for degrees and one for tenths of degrees and utilize sin(A + B) = sin(a)cos(b) + cos(A)sin(b)
In stead of calling the cos() or sin() every cycle of the loop, create variable before the loop which contains the value of cos(angle) or sin(angle) already.
The reason you're getting them is because pi/2 is not exactly representable in IEEE 754 notation, so there's no way to get the exact cosine of 90/270 degrees.
3 * cos(90°) = 3 * 0 = 0
When you need performance, you could use a precalculated sin/cos table (one table will do, stored as a Dictionary).
You'd still have to "calculate" sin(x) and cos(x), but it'd be decidedly faster, if you don't need a high degree of accuracy.
Modern Intel/AMD processors have instruction FSINCOS for calculating sine and cosine functions simultaneously.
Here is a small example: [http://home.broadpark.no/~alein/fsincos.html (hyper-link)]
Edit:
[Wikipedia (hyper-link)] suggests that FSINCOS was added at 387 processors, so you can hardly find a processor which doesn't support it.
Edit:
[Intel's documentation (hyper-link)] states that FSINCOS is just about 5 times slower than FDIV (i.e., floating point division).
Edit:
Please note that not all modern compilers optimize calculation of sine and cosine into a call to FSINCOS.
should give you sine and cosine in one step.
It could (and might) well take longer to do it this way (just because Euler’s Formula is mostly used to compute the complex exp using sin and cos – and not the other way round) but there might be some theoretical optimisation possible.
The headers in <complex> for GNU C++ 4.2 are using explicit calculations of sin and cos inside polar, so it doesn’t look too good for optimisations there unless the compiler does some magic (see the -ffast-math and -mfpmath switches as written in [Chi’s answer (hyper-link)]).
But I'd look to the fast implementations of SinCos that you find in libraries such as AMD's ACML and Intel's MKL.

This means you do something like this: starting at x and 1 for sin and cosine, follow the pattern - subtract x^2 / 2!
from cosine, subtract x^3 / 3!
to cosine, add x^5 / 5!
If you need less precision than the built in sin() and cos() give you, it may be an option.
Modern x86 processors have a fsincos instruction which will do exactly what you're asking - calculate sin and cos at the same time.
A good optimizing compiler should detect code which calculates sin and cos for the same value and use the fsincos command to execute this.
Tada, it uses the fsincos instruction!
If you are willing to use a commercial product, and are calculating a number of sin/cos calculations at the same time (so you can use vectored functions), you should check out [Intel's Math Kernel Library.
It has a [sincos function (hyper-link)]
According to that documentation, it averages 13.08 clocks/element on core 2 duo in high accuracy mode, which i think will be even faster than fsincos.
and you will get declarations of the sincos(), sincosf() and sincosl() functions that calculate both values together - presumably in the fastest way for your target architecture.
Many C math libraries, as caf indicates, already have sincos().
Sun has had sincos() since at least 1987 (twenty-three years; I have a hard-copy man page)
Became a built-in in gcc 3.4 (2004), __builtin_sincos().
More generally, many optimizations are temporary and can easily turn
   into pessimizations as cost ratios change.
I have posted a solution involving inline ARM assembly capable of computing both the sine and cosine of two angles at a time here: [Fast sine/cosine for ARMv7+NEON (hyper-link)]
This article shows how to construct a parabolic algorithm that generates both the sine and the cosine:
DSP Trick: Simultaneous Parabolic Approximation of Sin and Cos
[http://www.dspguru.com/dsp/tricks/parabolic-approximation-of-sin-and-cos (hyper-link)]
Remember that cos(x) and sin(x) are the real and imaginary parts of exp(ix).
An accurate yet fast approximation of sin and cos function simultaneously, in javascript, can be found here: [http://danisraelmalta.github.io/Fmath/ (hyper-link)]  (easily imported to c/c++)
It has good accuracy (maximum deviation from sin/cos on the order of 5e-8) and speed (slightly outperforms fsincos on a single call basis, and a clear winner over multiple values).
The names of these functions seem to imply that they do not compute separate sin and cos, but both "in one step".
Assembly (for x86) without /fp:fast but with /fp:precise instead (which is the default) calls separate sin and cos:
So /fp:fast is mandatory for the sincos optimization.
On my "slightly" older system (Intel Core 2 Duo E6750) with the latest MSVC 2019 compiler and appropriate optimizations, my benchmark shows that the sincos call is about 2.4 times faster than separate sin and cos calls.
cos() in openscad needs degrees, try:
Values of sin(a) and cos(a) are rational numbers only for particular angles (see [http://planetmath.org/encyclopedia/RationalSineAndCosine.html (hyper-link)] ) so you can't store values of sin(a) or cos(a) as Decimals without losing precision.
This defeats the purpose of converting sin and cos values to Decimal and having built-in functions that return sin and cos values as Decimals.
See the example here
[https://github.com/IBM/ibm-cos-sdk-python (hyper-link)]
As you've discovered COS does not ship with NFS client libraries, so GKE gets around this by setting up a chroot (at /home/kubernetes/containerized_mounter/rootfs) with the required binaries and calling mount inside that.
Since your equations have cos(a), they are not polynomials in a.
The [cosine of pi / 2 is zero (hyper-link)].
Lua simply wraps the standard C sin/cos functions - see [lmathlib.c (hyper-link)]1
In your example, the e-16 is very small and is basically zero as you said, but somewhere in the calculation there was probably a rounding error for the cosine values but it just so happened not to be the case for the sine values.
cos(90°) is not ~6.123, it's ~6.123E-17.
Basically, you can't exactly represent 90° as a finite-precision floating-point number, so you're not actually asking for cos(90°).
You're asking for cos of a number that's very close to 90°, and the answer is therefore very close to 0.
You seem to be using the law of cosines.
In this case, you want math.acos instead of math.cos^-1.
Because the function cos() is defined as taking an argument in radians: [https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/trigonometry/cos/ (hyper-link)]
no, this cannot be guaranteed, because cos is itself computed with an error, so its value can be an exact zero pretty easily.
Many systems have a lookup table for common values of sin and cos, so it's not inconceivable that exactly zero could be returned.
Note that this is a bound on the mathematically exact value, not on the value returned by the library function cos.  On a platform with a good-quality math library, this bound is sufficiently good that we can say that cos(x) is not zero for any double-precision x.
In fact, it turns out that this is not unique to double; this property holds for all IEEE-754 basic types, if cos is faithfully rounded.
Even more importantly, it's critical to note that in your example y can be infinite without cos(a) being zero:
If one were to implement cos with this approach, one would normally use cos symmetry first, to reduce the range to something smaller, e.g.
that cos(x + 2pi) = cos(x) and cos(x+pi) = - cos(x) and cos(-x) = cos(x), etc.
I made minimal changes to your code and it runs fine for your example calculation of cos(1).
This is the expected output for cos(1).
For cos(n) with n>1 the problem is that the values for factorial_denom are getting to big for an integer.
The cosine function has several identities, such as cos(x) = cos(-x) and cos(x) = cos(n*2*pi+x) for any integer n. Use these to reduce the angle to a limited range before running your series solution.
I’m assuming you are using a python notebook using the Apache Spark service and the jar file is in your project’s cos bucket (please update your question if these assumptions are incorrect).
Tcl has always called the inverse cosine function acos; it's part of expressions:
If you want the reverse cosine in degree, you could use this:
acos(-1) is pi.
IBM has a [Content Delivery Network (hyper-link)] that lets you stream media from Cloud Object Storage (COS).
There is a tutorial in the documentation that goes through the process of steaming videos and pictures from COS.
If I get your question right you are asking for the type of the value that cos returns.
"4*pi*cos(0.12)" etc.
This should be way faster than fitting a cosine.
90 degrees (pi/2 radians) has, as you said, a cosine of 0.
The cosine of that is (as you already found) -0.448074.
So you didn't really get 6.1 (a cosine/sine value that is greater than 1 is only possible for certain complex numbers), but 6.1 * 10^-17.
To get the expected answer, as sin() & cos() are between -1, 0 , +1, try to add 1 round it to the accurancy needed and substract 1.
*))" - that will match cos or sin only as a whole word (since \b is a word boundary) and the .
should be acceptable to you as an approximation of the cosine.
Once we start from a definition of cos/approx that is correct, we can start to work to make it efficient, via step-by-step rewriting to do things like preserve the accumulated factorials, etc., to eventually reach your definition.
If you check the [documentation (hyper-link)], you'll see that cos() accepts an angle in radians, not degrees.
The argument to sin() and cos() is in radians, not degrees.
In this code, substitute x by the number of you want to calculate cos.
Given the mathematical formula provided by the questioner, “x_1 = x_0*cos(Alpha) - y_0*sin(Alpha), y_1 = x_0*sin(Alpha) + y_0*cos(Alpha)”, I tested code in the question with several values.
Example:  cos_sinus(30, .3, .6) produces .669616.
But to put a long story short, you will want to translate your Canvas (or other drawing surface) a distance calculated by the cosine and sine functions.
Hypotenuse * cosine(angle in radians) will give you the horizontal displacement, and Hypotenuse * sine(angle in radians) will give you the vertical displacement.
If you want to learn more about Sine, Cosine, or Tangent, just google "Trigonometric ratios"..
You do not use the result of cos and it is optimized out as in this example
Change the variables to volatile to force cos call.
Another guess:
Maybe your cos implementation uses lookup tables.
In the GKE release notes, you can find the list of [current GKE minor versions (hyper-link)] available for each release channel as well as the COS version.
GKE generally uses the current [COS LTS releases (hyper-link)] available when at the time the initial GKE major/minor version is released.
GKE 1.18 initially GA'd in April 2020 at which time COS 85 was the current.
So all GKE 1.18 versions will almost always be based on COS 85.
The version of COS 85 available will usually be patch version available around the time of each GKE 1.18 release.
If you upgraded in May, then cos-85-13310-1209-29 would have been the COS version as it came out mid-April.
The otherway, as you described, is to iterate the COS objects.
Therefore, since I use a 16-bit bus, I need about 5461 clock cycles for one sin/cos.
To see the sin/cos wave with Vivado, right-click on the sin/cos signal and select 'waveform style' and then 'Analog'.
setting the bucketName and corresponding kwargs when calling cos.Object().
Math.sin and Math.cos methods will accept double values, and return a double.
Sounds like your using an older, IaaS COS setup.
COS is a true multitenant system - the entire public cloud is a single instance of COS (both IaaS and IAM-enabled are actually different windows into the same system).
This module should be part of cos or similar image in GKE as like other distros.
cos(75) means "the cosine of 75 radians".
so cos(radians(75)) means "the cosine of {the number of radians that's equivalent to 75°} radians", i.e.
"the cosine of 75°".
This means a large percentage of trigonometric computations will need to access RAM; each such access costs roughly several hundreds of CPU cycles.
After that tsin and tcos can be implemented inline as
Say you want cos2x distribution, from -pi/2 to pi/2.
Since integral of cos2x from -pi/2 to pi/2 is pi/2, you need to scale down so that the integral is 1.
Thus, the pdf P(x) = (2/pi)cos2x
Also note that std::cos() and std::sin() do not exactly satisfy the identity square(sin)+square(cos)=1.
functions like cos, sin and tan are in the standard library and can be used by including math.h.
Too many documents claim that x87 instructions like fsin or fsincos are the fastest way to do trigonometric functions.
In short, fsincos is too slow.
Here soft sin(0.5) is so fast, this CPU would do soft sin(0.5) and soft cos(0.5) faster than one x87 fsin.
If I also want cos(123), there is a chance that x87 fsincos would be faster than soft sin(123) and soft cos(123), for this CPU from 2010.
If there is, for example, only one floating point arithmetic register, then after doing the cos calculation, the result has to be stored in RAM in order to do the other cos calculation.
Suppose your code computes cos(x), then truncates that result and stores it into a temporary variable, say tmp.
It might then compute cos(y), and (drum roll please) compare the untruncated result of cos(y) with tmp, that is, with the truncated result of cos(x).
there is a good chance that the result of the second cos calculation will also be stored in RAM before the calculation.
Sin and Cos are simply the same curve offset by one-half radian (or 90 degrees), so:
If your sin/cos functions take radians:
If your sin/cos functions take degrees:
then any point on the unit circle in X,Y ( cartesian ) coordinates is ( cos( theta ), sin ( theta )).
sin(a)^2 + cos(a)^2 = 1  (pythagoras)
cos(a) = sqrt(1 - sin(a)^2))
the sign of the cos() seperately).
This is not possible if all you have is the sin() value (different angles can have the same sin() but cos() differs by sign).
This is almost certainly going to be faster than your cos(asin()) version and the [square root can also be optimized (hyper-link)] in practice.
x87 has square root and sin/cos but no inverse sin/cos functions.
Square root is faster than sin/cos.
Computing the cosine of the arc sine may lose you precision if you are in the 'near one' case (exercise: 1/ why ?
In term of speed: square rooting is easy (a few arithmetical operations for some newton-like method), but it is not clear what asin does (probably quite costly), cos is likely to be one order of magnitude slower than sqrt, and thus one square root is likely to be quickier than those two transcendental function calls.
Pass the same argument to cosine.
The only column in the new rows is the COS() value.
And same for cos.
squaring the sin and cos and adding:
That is, the value of (cos(phi2), 0.0 , sin(phi2)) is sin(phi2) (the parentheses don't change this).
So you can't give Math.cos the exact value needed to get 0.
My guess is that Javascript, which is notorious for its lack of precision with numbers, also creates an incorrect radian, and therefore its cosign is way off.
The sqrt is not necessary, you can get the same result with 1.*x*cos(n*pi*x/L).
I believe the answer to this question, without overly complicating the code, is no, since numpy already optimizes the vectorization (assigning of the cos and sin values to the array)
Looks like there is a delay between the release of new COS version and release of updated drivers.
However, I ran cos-extensions list just now, and it seems there are  drivers available:
std::sin on float has the same cost as sinf
std::sin on double has the same cost as sin
Note that functions like sin, cos, and so on do not return angles, they take angles as input.
You could take advantage by the fact that tan(x) contains both sin(x) and cos(x) function.
So you could use the tan(x) and retrieve cos(x) ans sin(x) using the common transformation function.
I've just timed this and it is about 25% faster than using sin and cos.
You can use complex numbers and the fact that e i · φ = cos(φ) + i · sin(φ).
A pure numpy version via complex numbers, e iφ = cosφ + i  sinφ,
inspired by the answer from [das-g (hyper-link)].
This is faster than the nprect, but still slower than sin and cos calls:
I compared the suggested solution with [perfplot (hyper-link)] and found that nothing beats calling sin and cos explicitly.
You'd just have to generate the data that will represent a sin/cos wave and pass it in to the chart engine.
Your problem is the numerator of the Maclauran series, which, in your expression, should be the cosine of zero (which equals 1), alternatively with sign + and -.
You have the sign right, but rather than cos(0) #=> 1, you have computed the angle in radians to the power 2*n+1.
because sin(x)**2 + cos(x)**2 = 1, you need only calculate sin(x) or cos(x) with the Maclauren series.
Below I've assumed we're estimating sin(x) (in which case cos(x) = 1-sin(x)**2)**0.5);
because the derivative of sin(x) is cos(x) and the derivative of cos(x) is -sin(x) and sin(0) is zero, we need only calculate the odd terms of the series, whose numerator is alternatively cos(0) and -cos(x) (1 and -1);
Let's look at the calculation of sin_and_cos(x,n) when:
Lastly we calculate the approximate value of the cosine:
Note the cosine is positive in the first and fourth quadrants, so
It is actually not possible using the aspera provided with COS.
You will have to use the "cos" plugin (instead of "server" as in doc)
Then you can just use that matrix and try to do the cos and sin calculations all at once:
You could take even strides as a mask and use fill A with the cos.  Then take odd strides as mask and fill with sin.
Note your sincos_lut doesn't analyze either.
Also note there were associated errors in the sincos_lut, both in port declarations and signal declarations.
(And you could have produced integers from the sincos_lut entity/architecture pair, but without a range constraint that would have likely been a 32 bit value).
macOS Homebrew:
It seems that there is not possible to get the COS bucket uploaded items by SL API.
However you can try with boto3 library of python to get the COS bucket items, see the following documentation.
The projection of this arc to x-axis is delta_x = s * sin(fi) and to y-axis it is delta_y = s * cos(fi)
r * delta_fi * cos(fi) = 1
delta_fi = 1/cos(fi)/r
The coordinates of a circle can indeed be completely defined using the trigonometric functions sine and cosine:
x = cos(angle)
x = cos(angle) * radius
I have found the problem: 
IBM's library [ibm-cos-sdk-python-core (hyper-link)], is their own version of the botocore library, however, on credentials.py from their repo, there is a reference to a library that's been renamed on Python 3 (httplib -> http.client).
The cosine of a number x close to pi/2 is roughly pi/2 - x, so the magnitude of the cosine of the nearest float to pi/2 would be roughly the magnitude of the difference between that float and the actual value of pi/2.
1) You need to use the sin and cos from NumPy as the math versions do not provide vectorized operations.
Math.sin(), Math.cos(),     etc
Be careful, sin and cos functions take a float or a double as input parameter.
[How the cos function is working (hyper-link)]
It seems you want your program input to be in degrees, but this is a problem because sin and cos use radians.
You need to draw a curve... X,Y,Z components of your curve is coming from the equation you have possibly with sin and cos and then you need to draw a curve by sampling the curve with small increments and connect the samples with lines...
Now we see that cos(x) and cos(y) are not the same!
This is because moveArgumentV2 changes the angle to be in the first and fourth quadrant (in the range [-pi/2, pi/2]), which is what you need for the sin function, but is not adequate for the cos function.
I would modify sin_taylorV2 and cos_taylorV2 to call moveArgumentV2, so you don't rely on the caller to know what the valid input range is.
In cos_taylorV2 you would need to call it this way:
Or, better, write cos_taylorV2 in terms of sin_taylorV2, which we know to be correct.
First, you don't need the moveArgumentV2(arg) function, as, if you remember, the radius of convergence for the Maclaurin/Taylor series of the sin(x)/cos(x) is [the set of all real numbers (hyper-link)].
As a matter of fact, following your code, we can write a function that approximates the cos as:
The values returned by the mycos function are close to the exact value given by the cos built-in function.
If we increase the number of points, the mycos function crumbles due to round-off errors, because of the factorial function that overflows.
Notice the recurrence between sucessive terms in the Maclaurin expansion of the cos function, and you can create another function without the use of the factorial:
As a matter of fact, if we now calculate the cos approximation with 500 terms, we get:
Notice in this figure the x marks are the calculations done with the mycos function, while the o marks are done without using the factorial function.
Avoid the calculation of factorial at all costs.
Also, you can use the acos and asin functions directly on s_x and s_y respectively.
In math is reverse operation for sin and cos.
This is arcsin and arccos.
But usually if it have cos and sin function then it can have reverse function.
asin(s_x), acos(s_y), perhaps, if you are using c.
I use the acos function to get back the angle from the given s_x cosinus.
But because several angles may result to the same cosinus (for example cos(+60°) = cos(-60°) = 0.5), it's not possible to get back the angle directly from s_x.
for the specific case of (s_y == 0), it does not matter to take +acos or -acos because it means the angle is 0° (+0° or -0° are the same angles) or 180° (+180° or -180° are the same angles).
Note that usually sine and cosine are computed together, I always wondered why the standard C library doesn't provide a sincos function.
atan2 is computed with a call to sincos and a little logic.
An alternative to directly using the service account JSON credentials, given the COS VM is already authorized to access the registry (e.g.
the attached service account has GCS view access to the project hosting the image), is to run the /usr/share/google/dockercfg_update.sh script shipped with COS:
The files are stored in COS, the [app built using Node.js (hyper-link)].
The snippet uses the mentioned ibm-cos-sdk with the S3 interface.
sin and cos take radians as input, not degrees.
You'll need to convert your angles to radians before passing them into sin and cos:
The new cos-61 [releases (hyper-link)] use docker 17.03 with overlay2 storage driver.
I have witnessed the same issue with all COS versions from 57.9202.64.0 (docker 1.11.2) on GKE 1.5 to 65.10323.85.0 (docker 17.03.2) on GKE 1.8.12-gke.1.
The overlay2 driver is only used for GKE 1.9+ clusters (fresh or upgraded) with the same COS version:
In C library math.h, there was a sincos function
Just use sin and cos separately and turn on optimizations.
C compilers are pretty good at optimizing, and they will probably realize that you are computing both the sine and cosine of the same variable.
The compiler will probably optimize away any calls to sin or cos in favour of simply using SSE intructions to calculate it.
I'm not sure SSE has a sincos opcode but even calculating them separatly is faster than calling any sincos function that the compiler won't optimize out.
When compiled with optimizations, it should produce the exact same code as calling sin and cos separately.
You can confirm this is the case with clang++ -std=c++17 -S -o - -c -O3 sincos.cpp on the following test code:
On MacOS with clang, both test functions compile to the exact same assembly (minus the name changes) that call ___sincos_stret to perform the combined computation (see [https://stackoverflow.com/a/19017286/973580 (hyper-link)]).
Instead, you can use this function which only uses std::cos and std::sqrt (haven't actually tested it, it may not work)
If Seed7 expects radians, you may need to convert degrees to radians before applying sin or cos:
Apparently, the ibm-cos-sdk was not installed properly.
After running npm install ibm-cos-sdk it worked fine.
Not sure why const IbmCos = require('ibm-cos-sdk'); is not sufficient.
The first, and the one I used, is to use an equivalent trig identity for the ACOS() function:
Excel.WorksheetFunction.ACOS(TheNumberGoesHere)
Square root is relatively simple to calculate, but I'm not convinced it's a huge difference between sqrt(1-sin*sin) and calculating cos again.
What processor may also be a factor, and what other calculations are done "around" the sin/cos calculations.
The GNU C library has [a sincos() function (hyper-link)], which will take advantage of the "FSINCOS" instruction which most modern instruction sets have.
If precision is not critical the fastest way to get sin or cos is to use tables.
Hold some global const array with sin and cos values for all agles with a step you need.
So your sin/cos function just need to cast angle to index and you get the result.
This type of error occurs when you call np.cos(a_symbol), which apparently translates under-the-hood in numpy to a_symbol.cos().
Obviously any AWS features that aren't supported by COS wouldn't work, and any COS extensions (like API key auth, or Key Protect, etc) wouldn't be available.
My aim was to use the IBM COS (Cloud Object Storage) service: read, write and delete files from it.
implement all these features (read, write, delete) manually via REST API of IBM COS service (which should be S3 compliant)
I'm pretty sure your coprocessor has sin and cos operations, and you can call them using Assembler, something like:
If you really need to implement the sin and cos functions yourself you should use the taylor series sin x = x - x^3/3!
.. and cos x = 1 -x^2/2!+x^4/4!-x^6/6!
Container sync for ICOS is on the roadmap but not yet slated for a scheduled release.
However, If you want to sync the existing container with COS S3, you can use open source tool like [Rclone (hyper-link)] .
I think you're using the wrong series for the cosine, the [correct formula (hyper-link)] would be (I highlighted the important differences with ^):
No sqrt(), atan2() or cos() or sin().
With -ffast-math (which implies -fno-math-errno), clang -O3 will inline __builtin_cos to @llvm.cos.f64
photonAngle is in degrees but Math.sin/cos takes radians.
since   cos ϴ = X / H  (basic definition of cosine),  we can say (via simple algebra)
Now our classic definition-of-cosine formula (when translated to our terms) looks like
"why am I using cosine to calculate the vertical velocity then?
Finally, why is there a negative in the cosine?
The squiggly line is cosine, the straight lines are your approximation.
As it is, sine and cosine in Javascript (and many other standard libraries) are very well optimised AND very precise.
)like cos_hmac_keys.access_key_id.
Maple follows the usual convention for the [principal value (hyper-link)] of arccos.
You can simplify arccos(cos(x)) back to just x under the assumptions that x lies with [0,Pi].
Look at Read command [http://docs.intersystems.com/latest/csp/docbook/DocBook.UI.Page.cls?KEY=RCOS_cread (hyper-link)]
COS, SIN and TAN, but interestingly, NOT for TANH, etc.).
If you have your own COS system (aka dsNet) set up, then those values correspond to any container vaults or provisioning codes.
Note that if you store the direction d as a unit vector rather than an angle you can save some sin & cos calls as the direction of the chord is then the direction d rotated through a/2, and the direction at V is d rotated through a.
And some processors have machine instructions for sin, cos and tan but they might not be used (because the compiler or libm know that they are slower than a routine).
the trig functions are not as accurate aa the other math functions on the x86, so sin / cos will not give the same result as tan, which is something you should bear in mind if IEEE compliance is your reason for asking this.
As for the speed up, sin and cos can be obtained from the same instruction, so long as the compiler is not brain dead.
The compiler can not therefore substitute sin/cos without breaking the standard.
But even if not, the compiler may rearrange the order of instruction execution to hide the true cost.
It's certainly slower to use texture lookups for sin/cos as it is to execute the instructions.
You'd have to test this out yourself, but I'm pretty sure that branching in a shader is far more expensive than a sin or cos calculation.
[Google'd links (hyper-link)] say cos and sin are single-cycle on mainstream cards since 2005 or so.
If you use both sin and cos in your shader, you can calculate only sin(a) and cos(a) = sqrt(1.0 - sin(a)) since sin(x)*sin(x) + cos(x)*cos(x) is always 1.0
The relationship between the sine and cosine of each FFT complex bin result is related to the phase of the sinusoidal input component at that frequency (of the bin center), circularly relative to the start and end.
If the phase changes, so can both the sine and cosine component.
The instructions fsin, fcos, and fptan are not accurate to 1.0 ulp as Intel claims:
[http://notabs.org/fpuaccuracy/ (hyper-link)]
GNU libc's documentation (accessible by running info libc math errors) lists a 1 ulp "known error" for cosl on x86 and "x86_64/fpu."
I can reproduce similarly huge errors for cosl around pi/2 on my x86_64 machine.
cos(90) (degrees) is approximately zero, as in 0.0.
How close it the result actually is depends on how they represented pi, 90.0, 180.0, and the implementation of the cos function in math.h.
I don't know why you think it "should be -3.2051033e-9" because cos(90º) is zero, and -0.0000000032051033 is well outside of the margin of error of your calculations,
In the cos function (cos ), return value is a real.
And also you can check it with inverse cos with cos(6.12303e-017) and you will see it is 90 degree
I am a bit surprised as you mention f(a) and your function does not contain an a, but in general, suppose you want to plot f(x) = cos(x)^2
cos, sin, and tan take an angle in radians as input and return the ratio; acos, asin, and atan take a ratio as input and return an angle in radians.
Khan academy refresher on trigonometry, unit circle, angular mathematics to use sin,cos,tan to describe rotation and changes in rotation.
I like this method,use sind(x) or cosd(x)
Since the number of significant digits of a float is about 7, and the slope (first derivative) of sin() and cos() at that points is +/- 1, I would say that the results are as good as you can expect.
One alternative is to use grads or degrees instead of radians, so that the multiples of full circles, as well as multiples of each quadrant are integers and also the sines and cosines of those arguments can be represented exactly.
The credentials in IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) is at COS instance level, not at individual file level.
Each COS instance can have any number of buckets with each bucket containing files.
You can get the credentials for the COS instance from Bluemix console.
So 1 / cos(M_PI_2) can be very big number, not even infinity.
Side note: The function cosine is zero at 90° Degrees (or π/2 Radians).
The code runs because the zeros of cos(x) lie at pi/2 + k*pi; k € Z.
In broad, general, terms since the only real values with a zero cosine are irrational (i.e.
odd multiples of pi/2) and floating point values cannot represent irrational real values, it is not possible for any floating point value to exist that has a zero cosine.
I would expect, if the system has previously been accepted as acceptable for use in safety-related applications like you say, there would be some analysis of the circumstances in which a statement like dA = bB / cos(x) might produce an erroneous result (e.g.
That analysis would depend on how the cos() function is implemented - e.g.
However, if you use any mingwrt version pre-dating mingwrt-3.21, (and the less said about utterly broken mingwrt-4.x the better), then there is a known bug resulting from arbitrarily deeming any purely real cacos() argument value greater than (1.0, 0.0i) to be outside the valid domain, (as would be the case for acos() on its real part), which would yield the result you report.
Since C++ has overloading, you can call [std::acos  (hyper-link)] for complex values too.
If you intepret cos(), and then construct the string, this can work:
This doesn't look to be a containerd issue but rather a Container-Optimized OS  expected behaviour due to COS provides another level of hardening by providing security-minded default values for several features.
On the other hand, Ubuntu containerd does not have the same strict exec/noexec depending on the mount like with COS, so, it could be a good idea to use Ubuntu based images instead of COS as a workaround.
This is confirmed now as a bug in cos-extensions: [https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/164134488 (hyper-link)]
There aren't any good production workarounds at the moment, because as a user it's hard to modify COS's behavior without some advanced scripting.
itself if it is one of "cos", "sin", "tan" or "ctg"
So not a direct rounding issue with sin(), cos(), tan().
In your computed signal, the instantaneous phase is the argument to the cos function:
To do that, given arbitrary t, just compute the argument of the cos as the cumulative integral of frequencyCourse with respect to t. This is easily done with [cumtrapz (hyper-link)]:
The angles(thetas) are passed through the sin() and cos() function so that the observations are in the range [-1,1].
You could even use one of the sin() or cos() as your observation.
The reason(which I can think of) for using both sin() and cos() is probably to give more information about the state.
Maybe using both sin() and cos() leads to a faster convergence.
I ran DDPG with just sin() and theta_dot in one experiment and with sin(), cos() and theta_dot in another experiment.
The usage of both sin() and cos() is experimental I guess.
It solves my problem completely (at the cost of adding yet another package to my code.
As I said in the comment above, solutions x in cos(x + b) = a are given by ±arccos(a) - b + 2πk, for integer k. Hence, we want to compare two particular solutions that belong to the interval [0,2π]
x1 = arccos(a) - b + 2πk with the smallest integer k such that arccos(a) - b + 2πk >= 0 and
x2 = -arccos(a) - b + 2πk with the smallest integer k such that -arccos(a) - b + 2πk >= 0.
In your case, I suggest to create a bashj file with a java methods loading data into double[][] from the file, and a java function returning the Math.sin() and Math.cos() of the loaded data, using row col index as parameters...
The first thing you should note is that you'll have to be careful to pick the correct root for sqrt(1 - sin(x)**2), otherwise you run the risk of evaluating |cos(x)|, which is not the same.
Use cos(x) as you should avoid such perceived micro-optimisations: you'll do well to beat any optimisation approach adopted by a modern FORTRAN compiler.
My hunch is that the latest compilers would reverse out your identity for you and substitute cos(x): check the output assembly.
The cos_wave() function is not necessary.
You can just call np.cos on an array of times to get the cosine value for every point.
We expect that cos(pi/2) has value zero.
Your floating point calculation cos(PI/2) has an error of about 6.1232339957367660E-017 from the mathematical answer.
The cosine of p/2 is about 6.123233995736765886•10−17.
Le [law of cosines (hyper-link)] tells us that, if a,b,c are the lengths of three sides of a triangle, the cosine of the angle of the edge facing c, is :
the inverse function fo cosinus is arccosinus, i.e.
[acos() (hyper-link)] in the c++ library.
Please note that the syntax you have used in your original code defines acos to be a variable (which remains unititalized).
As you are aware, math.sin and math.cos expect their arguments to be in radians, not degrees, and, as this line shows:
Arc Cosine is the inverse of cosine.
Cosine takes an angle as input, and returns a value ranging from -1 to 1.
Arc Cosine (acos) takes a value from -1 to 1 as input, and returns an angle.
The input to acos() is not an angle, so you should not try to convert it between degrees and radians.
x = RADIANS_TO_DEGREES(acos(1)).
That would give you the angle at which the cosine is 1, expressed in degrees.
(The value of acos(1) is 0, which is the same in degrees or radians.)
Better to use acos(0) as a test value.
The cosine function = 0 at pi/2 (or 90 degrees.)
I see now that in your question you were taking acos(cos(DEGREES_TO_RADIANS(1)), which is correct.
However, you still need to convert the result of acos() to degrees if you want your answer in degrees, as described above.
Note that cos(1) is a little strange, in both degrees and radians.
cos(0) = 1, cos(pi) = -1, cos(2pi) = 1.
(or in degrees)
cos(180) = -1, and cos(360) = 1)
cos(1) in degrees is going to be an strange decimal value, and so will cos(1) in radians.
I think it will be better to move the code to compute the cosine to a function of its own.
If the problem is with the ELSE case, then the problem is the units, [use unitless function (hyper-link)] for the $theta and $r values before cos or sin function is executed.
Math.Cos() is using radians while your calculator is using degrees.
Math.Cos function takes values in radians.
You are not squaring each term so you are calculating and printing sin(x) + cos(x).
your class is called Math, but you're making a reference to the system's Math by using Math.sin() and Math.cos() -> rename your class to avoid the ambiguity
you expect Math.cos() and Math.sin() to take their arguments in degrees, while they actually expect radians.
The cosine of π/2 = 0. so the balls speed in the X should not change.
cos(0°) = cos(0) = 1
cos(90°) = cos(π/2) = 0
cos(180°) = cos(π) = -1
cos(270°) = cost(3π/2) = 0
The C cos function requires its argument to be in radians rather than degrees.
While the cosine of sixty degrees is 0.5, the cosine of 60 radians is about -0.95, which is why you're seeing -7.62 when you multiply it by eight.
So the error is caused by calling np.cos(alpha) where alpha is an object array.
I know I will never get a 100% precise value of these numbers, but AT LEAST I was expecting to get the same "unprecise" value of sin and cos of complementary angles.
Transcendental functions like sin, cos, exp... are not required because it's very complex
Don't get me wrong, I know I will never get a 100% precise value of these numbers, but AT LEAST I was expecting to get the same "unprecise" value of sin and cos of complementary angles
There's not only a single algorithm to calculate sin and cos. Each will be correct for some set of inputs but incorrect for some others.
The library functions sin and cos expect their input to be in radians but you passed them degrees instead.
Each cosine calculation should convert from degrees to radians, then run the Taylor series loop N times using that angle as the input 'x'.
As I know there's no out of box XSLT function for advanced
  calculation, anyone have any idea how I can do math such as
  Cosine/Sin() within XSLT?
The wellknown trigonometric functions: sin(), cos(), tan(), cot(), sec(), csc()
Hyperbolic trigonometric functions: hsin(), hcos(), htan(), hcot(), hsec(), hcsc()
Inverse functions: arcsin(), arccos(), arctan(), arccot(), arcsec(), arccsc(), archsin(), archcos(), archtan(), archcot(), archsec(), archcsc(),
Once you've reduced your argument, most chips use a CORDIC algorithm to compute the sines and cosines.
Those differences my well lead to greater performance at the cost of less accuracy, or vice-versa (and of course, they can just be plain bad at both, since we live in an imperfect world) so there would be times when one might favour performing the algorithm in the CPU (as would happen if you coded the algorithm yourself) rather than in the FPU like fsin passes to.
I have not been able to reproduce this on latest COS image which is "cos-dev-70-11021-11-0", you could retry with latest.
Here is the command/output I've tried with instance created from latest cos-dev image:
It also seems like several parts of the query are constants and could be factored out:  acos(cos(radians(51.519159)), radians(-0.133190), sin(radians(51.519159))
math.sin, math.cos, etc.
math.sin() and math.cos() take angles in [Radians (hyper-link)] and not in Degrees.
The same would be the case with numpy.sin() and numpy.cos()
Angles are in radians, not degrees, for the standard versions (i.e., a right angle is π/2), and in ‘half-rotations’ for cospi etc.
Seemed that the ACOS/COS/SIN extensions I found for Doctrine were not really that great.

Different results in C and C# with Sin and Cos
The standard cannot make that guarantee, simply because the result of std::cos may not be representable exactly by a double, so you get a truncation error, which will affect the result of std::acos.
” If no errors occur, [acos returns] the arc cosine of arg (arccos(arg)) in the range [0 ; π]
In degrees, that's 0 to 180, inclusive, corresponding to cosine values 1 down through -1, inclusive.
Computing the cosine discards information about which angle you had outside of that range.
First, in degrees, cos(x) = cos(K*360 + x), for arbitrary integer K. Secondly, cos(x) = cos(-x).
This adds up to an awful lot of angle values that produce the same cosine value.
Also, even though all readers likely know this, but for completeness: since sines are cosines are very irrational numbers, generally not simple fractions, you can't expect exact results except for maybe cosine 1, which corresponds to 0 degrees.
For example, cos(2*PI) is 0, but so is cos(4*PI).
Both Amazon and IBM COS use the S3 protocol.
Softlayer had its own SWIFT protocol before, but it is not available (anymore) for IBM COS.
The examples use Amazon and IBM COS, both with S3 protocol.
In Rust 1.51 (and below) functions like sin, cos, or log10 are not part of the core library (core::) but only the standard library (std::), therefore they are not available.
You can add your default repository as a second server to your cos2 repository using the command:
After that you can merge the COS master branch to your current cos2 branch:
This way you can easily pull commits from cos to cos2.
Functions cos and sin receive angles in radians instead of degrees.
Ask google about "cos(180)"   => -0.59846006905
It's because it using radians and not degrees.
In radians, 180° is half a circle, so it's pi, ask google cos(pi) => -1
:)
cos and sin can only take a Floating argument, yet the type signature for gateR says that t is an Integral type, and not all Integrals are Floating.
Your functions only demand the constraint of Integral t thus you need to convert your t with fromIntegral and possibly an explicit type signature so you can apply sine and cosine.
Since the floating point representation of pi will never be any closer to pi than machine epsilon, the cosine of that value over two will be similarly different from the expected result of 0.
The fact that the M_PI macro uses more precision than a double has, does not change the fact that the argument of the cos function, M_PI/2 is calculated as a double.
So, instead of calculating the cosine of the exact number 'pi/2', which is 0, you're calculating the cosine of the floating-point number closest to 'pi/2'.
Output: n*cos(2.0*n)
Output: 2*cos(2*x)
Plugging Coefficient[TrigReduce[(a + b*Cos[x])^4],Cos[2*x]] into Wolfram|Alpha produced the output you wanted it to.
The trigonometric functions you are using (sin, cos, atan2) require their parameter to be in radians, not degrees.
the cos(self.toCoordinate.latitude) is wrong because self.toCoordinate.latitude is in degrees but cos requires radians.
You're not passing a function to integrate, you're passing the value returned by cos(k).
The circular functions here (cos(), sin()) take angles in radians (2*Pi radians in a circle), but the angles are given in degrees (360 degrees in a circle), so the Radians() function converts Degrees to Radians so that the circular functions will give the correct results.
The real problem is that pi / 2.0 can't be, so the input to your cos function isn't "correct".
If you are dealing with floating points (as any cosine function must), you can't avoid issues like this.
is this number within a certain range of values around zero), not absolute comparison, even with simpler functions than cosine.
For Java 6, the [Math (hyper-link)] library delegates several of its calls (including cos) to [StrictMath (hyper-link)], which says in the class documentation:
So I Googled for [fdlibm (hyper-link)], and then took a look at [k_cos.c (hyper-link)], and the implementation there approximates with a degree 14 polynomial.
First it needs to have from math import cos.
Then I added print(equation1) and found that when I typed cos(a), printed cos().
For instance, in x86 architecture, there is a single instruction that computes sine and cosine.
So first you create them by vkos.push_back(cos(value)) instead of directly assigning to the index.
Math.Cos(near_pi/2) resulted in a value near 0.0, but not _exactly 0.0.
The reason you obtain this value as result is that you did not apply cos to π/2, which is not representable as a double anyway (it's irrational).
The cos function was applied to a double close to π/2, obtained by multiplying 90 by M_PI and dividing by 180.
In fact, since floating-point numbers are more dense near zero, it is extremely unlikely for any floating-point format that applying a correctly rounded cos to any floating-point number produces exactly zero as result.
In fact, since the derivative of cos in π/2 is -1, the value obtained for the expression cos(M_PI/2.0) is a close approximation of the difference between M_PI/2 and π/2.
Note that the same argument applies to obtaining 0.5 as the result of cos(M_PI/3.0), or even -1.0 as the result of cos(M_PI).
The simplest solution to your problem would be to use hypothetical functions cosdeg and sindeg that would compute directly the cosine and sine of angles in degrees.
The functions sinpi and cospi pointed out by njuffa are often available, and they allow to compute the sine and cosine or π/2, π/4 or even 7.5*π, but not of π/3, since the number 1/3 they would have to be applied to is not representable exactly in binary floating-point.
Check out this excerpt from the [IBM COS API docs (hyper-link)]:
According to the [IBM documentation (hyper-link)], COS
If the functions you need turn out to not be supported can probably use [HTTPClient (hyper-link)] to wrap COS native API endpoints.
Of course it should "just work" but here is a case where, with a little help for the "simpler equation with cos" given above you can get an answer:
I imagine that calculation with several conversions, cos and sin is rather heavy.
is a sinusoid for any choice of phi (as would be cos(2*pi*fs*t + phi)) .
Since both numpy and and sympy have their own definition of cos.
The error is telling you that the Mul object (which is n*x) does not have a cosine method, since the interpreter is now confused between the sympy and numpy methods.
Because floating point representation isn't always exact and functions like cos and sin are calculated by approximate numerical methods, it is unreasonable to imagine that the results will be bitwise identical.
On my machine, I get this when I compare sine and cosine
and all possible sign variations, since cosine is an even function.
the spatial search distance function on p27 does not convert to radians or multiply longitude by cos(latitude), unless his spatial data is loaded with this in consideration (cannot tell from context of article), but his example on p26 indicates that his spatial data POINT is not loaded with radians or degrees.
This error could be easily avoided if you made the approximate cosine computation a separate function.
To be a little more precise, the error of a cosine partial sum is smaller than the next term, as the series is alternating.

So, for example, to include tf.cos opperation into your libtensorflow_inference.so you need to do the following:
Make sure || isequal(op, "Cos") is in the ops_to_register.h file (see my explanation above)
Add cwise_op_cos.cc to android_extended_ops_group1 filegroup in tensorflow/core/kernels/BUILD
Not sure where you get the idea that -2*cos(100*pi) should be anything other than -2.
And you should know that cos(2*pi*(an integer)) = 1.
cosd uses degrees instead of radians.
Radians is the default for cos so matlab has a separate function when degree input is used.
To avoid this, a common way to compute sine and cosine is to first fold to between -45 and +45 degrees.
if you want sincos under MSVC, you can use the implementation(s) from the XNA math library, namely XMVectorSinCos and XMScalarSinCos, which suck as they are float only or you need to use an external library like AMD's [LibM (hyper-link)] (for x64 only) or a smaller time one like [this (hyper-link)].
double overloaded sin() and cos() do not maintain 15-digit decimal precision
The sines and cosines of those quotients are taken.
Additionally, sin and cos are difficult to implement, and common implementations prefer speed and provide it at the cost of allowing a little additional error.
Since you can derive a set weights to approximate a sine or cosine function, that must inform your idea of what inputs the neural net will need in order to have some chance of succeeding.
Further down the wikipedia page on Taylor series, there are expansions for sin and cos, which are given in terms of odd powers of x and even powers of x respectively (think about it, sin is odd, cos is even, and yes it is that straightforward), so if you supply all the powers of x I would guess that the sin and cos versions will look pretty similar with alternating zero weights.
(sin: 0, 1, 0, -1/6..., cos: 1, 0, -1/2...)
I think you can always compute sine and then compute cosine externally.
I think your concern here is why the neural net is not learning the cosine function when it can learn the sine function.
Since cosine can be computed by sine 90 minus angle, you could find the weights and then recompute the weights in 1 step for cosine.
Edit:  if you know that the curve will always be shaped "like" a portion of Sin/Cos curve, then if you know the smallest period that might be represented, you can do some optimizations by using binary search algorithm to "look" for the inflection points (where the slope (Change in Y to the left and to the right ) are of different signs.
After you collected a few points (>=4) you could use a form of local search to match your points to a sine curve y = A cos(Bx+C)+D then use a simple formula based on the derivative to find the minimum.
returns:
-cos(2*x)/2 + 1/2
trigsimp((sin(x)**2*cos(x)).rewrite(tan))
retruns
4*(-tan(x/2)**2 + 1)*cos(x/2)**6*tan(x/2)**2
On the other hand if you want to reduce sin(x)**2*cos(x) a similar strategy works.
In that case you have to rewrite the cos and sin to exp and as before expand rewrite  and simplify again as:
sin(incr/2) = √((1-cos(incr))/2) ⇒
sin²(incr/2) = (1-cos(incr))/2 ⇔
2·sin²(incr/2) = 1-cos(incr) ⇔
1-2·sin²(incr/2) = cos(incr)
sin(base+incr) = (1 - 2·sin²(incr/2)) · sin(base) + sin(incr) · cos(base)
cos(base+incr) = (1 - 2·sin²(incr/2)) · cos(base) - sin(incr) · sin(base)
sin(base+incr) = sin(base) + (sin(incr) · cos(base) - 2·sin²(incr/2) · sin(base))
cos(base+incr) = cos(base) - (2·sin²(incr/2) · cos(base) + sin(incr) · sin(base))
sin(base+incr) = fma (-2·sin²(incr/2), sin(base), fma ( sin(incr), cos(base), sin(base)))
cos(base+incr) = fma (-2·sin²(incr/2), cos(base), fma (-sin(incr), sin(base), cos(base)))
sin(base+incr) = sin(base) + fma (sin(incr), cos(base), -2·sin²(incr/2) · sin(base))
cos(base+incr) = cos(base) - fma (sin(incr), sin(base),  2·sin²(incr/2) · cos(base))
The scaffolding below evaluates each of the computational alternative discussed above by generating many (base, incr) pairs, then iterates for each of them for a set number of steps while collecting errors of all sine and cosine values generated.
From this it computes a [root-mean square error (hyper-link)] for each test case, separately for sines, cosines.
For example, if you precompute sin(incr*2^x) and cos(incr*2^x) for x=6 ... 31, say, then you can use the angle-sum formulas to calculate the result for each incr=64*n one bit at a time while you output the previous 64 values.
Also, since you're only going to need 64 incremental results from any exact base, you can precompute the 64 sines and cosines required to calculate those results directly from the base instead of the previous result.
It is possible to rearrange the equations for sin(base+incr) and cos(base+incr) in the following way:
sin(base+incr) = cos(incr) · sin(base) + sin(incr) · cos(base)
sin(base+incr) = sin(base) + (1 - cos(incr)) · -sin(base) +  sin(incr) · cos(base)
sin(base+incr) = sin(base) + sin(incr) · (-1 / sin(incr) · (1 - cos(incr)) · sin(base) + cos(base))
sin(base+incr) = sin(base) + sin(incr) · (-tan(incr/2) · sin(base) + cos(base))
cos(base+incr) = cos(incr) · cos(base) - sin(incr) · sin(base)
cos(base+incr) = cos(base) - sin(incr) · (tan(incr/2) · cos(base) + sin(base))
Here we use the formula (1-cos(x)/sin(x) = tan(x/2), 
see [here (hyper-link)], for example.
With gcc -O3 -Wall -m64 -march=skylake fastsincos.c -lm (GCC version 7.3), the results are:
That takes away the predefined handler function (which treats sin and cos as prefix operators).
This has the additional benefit of doing fewer calls to cos() and sin().
1.5707963267949 (cosinus^-1(acos))
You're trying to approximate cos(x) around 0.0.
So you should use the properties of the cos() function to reduce your input value to a value near 0.0.
For instance, remove multiples of 2*pi, and get the values of cos() in [pi/4, pi/2] by computing sin(x) around 0.0 and so on.
cos(x) usually is implemented by range reduction followed by a dedicated implementation for the range [0, pi/2].
Range reduction uses cos(x+2*pi) = cos(x).
Now what happens if you try something as absurd as cos(1<<30) ?
@EDIT1: Modified the code that it dumps header contents + each .cos contents into a separate file.
Since the sin/cos of those angles have no exact representation (like, say Cos[45 Degree] which is 1/sqrt(2)), you'll need to do N[Cos[2]] and N[Sin[12 Degree]] (i.e.
In[1]:=  Cos[2]
  Out[1]:= Cos[2]
In[2]:=  N[Cos[2]]
  Out[2]:= -0.416147
Cosine_distance = 1 - cosine_similarity
Usually, people use the cosine similarity as a similarity metric between vectors.
Now, the distance can be defined as 1-cos_similarity.
Similarly you can define the cosine distance for the resulting similarity value range.
Cosine similarity range: −1 meaning exactly opposite, 1 meaning exactly the same, 0 indicating orthogonality.
If we leave the cosine part out:
and the values in these array would be what multiply the base value inside your cosine in the code above.
COS usually refers to Class of Service which are actually a set of rules/policies created by admin for the mailboxes where one of possible rule is "Quota Violation".
I think that the network you built is too small to learn the periodic behaviour of the cosine function (try increasing the number of hidden units and/or adding hidden layers), also I don't think a regular (fully connected neural network) is the right choice if you want to learn a function that has a periodic sequential nature, try using an RNN or LSTM for this.

Math.cos() expects the parameter to be in radians.
[Math.cos() (hyper-link)] uses radians, so to get your expected result you need to do

cos(50deg) give same result as cos(50)... so Wolfram is degree by default.
Streaming values into cout outputs x=0.2 cos(y) y=4
I have a mathematical expression such as cos(pi*cos(pi * sin(pi*y)))
  and I want to solve it.
cos ( A ...

where A = pi * cos ( B ...

where B = pi * sin ( C ...

where C = pi * y
now you can evaluate pi * y, and return the value of C

... and now you have C, you can evaluate pi * sin(C) and return the value of B

... and now you have the value of B, you can evaluate pi * cos(B), returning the value as A

... and now you have the value of A, you can evaluate cos(A), and you're done.
This is exactly the way the C expression cos(M_PI * cos(M_PI * sin(M_PI * y))) works (assuming the common but non-standard constant for π).
If you calculate sines and cosines for angles between 0 and 45 degrees, you can bootstrap your way to calculating all trig functions for all angles.
Once you've reduced your argument, most chips use a [CORDIC (hyper-link)] algorithm to compute the sines and cosines.
I'm not much of a mathematician, but my understanding of where sin, cos, and tan "come from" is that they are, in a sense, observed when you're working with right-angle triangles.
If you take measurements of the lengths of sides of a bunch of different right-angle triangles and plot the points on a graph, you can get sin, cos, and tan out of that.
Note that the Tj(x) and Tk(x) in the Wolfram article I linked to used the cos and inverse cosine, these are polynomials and in practice you use a recurrence formula to get the coefficients.
Don't get me wrong: Taylor series will work properly for sine/cosine (with reasonable precision for the range -pi/2 to +pi/2; technically, with enough terms, you can reach any desired precision for all real inputs, but try to calculate cos(100) using Taylor series and you can't do it unless you use arbitrary-precision arithmetic).
If I were stuck on a desert island with a nonscientific calculator, and I needed to calculate sine and cosine, I would probably use Taylor series since the coefficients are easy to remember.
But the real world applications for having to write your own sin() or cos() functions are rare enough that you'd be best off using an efficient implementation to reach a desired accuracy -- which the Taylor series is not.
If your asking for a more physical explanation of sin, cos, and tan consider how they relate to right-angle triangles.
The actual numeric value of cos(lambda) can be found by forming a right-angle triangle with one of the angles being lambda and dividing the length of the triangles side adjacent to lambda by the length of the hypotenuse.
Most commonly for computers, power series representation is used to calculate sines and cosines and these are used for other trig functions.
I would like to extend the answer provided by @Jason S. Using a domain subdivision method similar to that described by @Jason S and using Maclaurin series approximations, an average (2-3)X speedup over the tan(), sin(), cos(), atan(), asin(), and acos() functions built into the gcc compiler with -O3 optimization was achieved.
For the tan(), sin(), and cos() functions, and for simplicity, an overlapping 0 to 2pi+pi/80 domain was divided into 81 equal intervals with "anchor points" at pi/80, 3pi/80, ..., 161pi/80.
Then tan(), sin(), and cos() of these 81 anchor points were evaluated and stored.
Similar methods were developed for the atan(), asin(), and acos() functions, where an overlapping -1.0 to 1.1 domain was divided into 21 equal intervals with anchor points at -19/20, -17/20, ..., 19/20, 21/20.
Results of the atan() function were then used to approximate asin() and acos().
However the argument input to the asin() and acos() approximating functions is truncated to the ±1 domain because any value outside it is meaningless.
To remove the bias of evaluating a billion random numbers and processing the results, the cost of a run without evaluating any trig or inverse trig function was performed first.
The estimates are obtained by subtracting the time cost of evaluating one billion random numbers shown in the first row of Table 1 from the remaining rows in Table 1.
Time spent in sin() and cos(): 19.4052 19.4311
Time spent in SINCOS3(): 7.85564 7.92844
Time spent in SINCOS4(): 9.36672 9.57946
Time spent in asin() and acos(): 36.8833 36.9496
Time spent in ASINCOS1(): 10.1655 9.78479
Time spent in ASINCOS2(): 10.6236 10.6000
Time spent in ASINCOS3(): 12.8430 12.0707
SINCOS#() means that both sin and cos were evaluated at the same time.
Likewise, ASINCOS#() means both asin and acos were evaluated at the same time.
I am trying to utilize the Math.Cos() function in c# to print a range of of values from 0 to 2PI increasing by .1PI
If you know the functions that are in your expression (such as sin, cos and tan), you can do the following according to this [stack overflow question (hyper-link)]:
Use the Math object: Math.sin() and Math.cos()
So you should be looking at the cos(phi/2)*cos(psi/2) term for the angle.
angle = 2 * cos^-1(w) = 2 * cos^-1( cos(phi/2)cos(psi/2) )
You can produce sin and cos in a similar way.
Your index in calcCosFact was wrong.
I got this result:
    Enter an angle (in degrees): 180 Enter the number of terms to use: 5
    Cos:-0.976022212624, Sinus:0.00692527070751
Further optimization is obtained by computing both cos and sin values at once, so that the powers are only computed once.
Your cosin and sine function return a float, but in order to get that result you still have to store it in a variable.
cosCalc (rad);
rad = cosCalc (rad);
Applying sin to even indices and cos to odd indices indicates that we are filtering the initial tensor accross columns.
