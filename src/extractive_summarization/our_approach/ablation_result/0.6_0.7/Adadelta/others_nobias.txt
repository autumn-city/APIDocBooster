I think Adadelta performs better with bigger networks than yours, and after some iterations it should equal the performance of RMSProp or Adam. 
 This is just like AdaDelta... instead of rho, we are writing beta 1 and beta 2. 
 So, in today’s class we will  talk about two more algorithms,   one of them is RMSProp and the other  one is Adam and we will also see a   very closely related algorithm which  is very closely related to RMSProp. 
 And we said   that there is a very closely related algorithm  very closely related to this RMSProp; so,   that closely related algorithm  is what is known as AdaDelta.  So, we have a closely related algorithm known as  AdaDelta. 
This algorithm is very similar to Adadelta, but performs better in my opinion.
