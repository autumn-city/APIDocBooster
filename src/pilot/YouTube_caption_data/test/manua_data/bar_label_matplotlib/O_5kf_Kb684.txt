Hey there, how's it going everybody? 
In this video, we want to talk about  
how to show or let's say how to add these labels, 
I mean these values on a bar chart. So make sure  
to keep watching this video until the end of 
it. So first of all, we import matplotlib.pyplot  
as plt. And remember matplotlib is not a built-in 
package in python, so if you want to use it,  
you should install it first. So we have imported 
matplotlib.pyplot as plt. There it is! And then  
we define a variable, let's say called x, 
which is the x axis of our bar plot. It is A,  
B, C. It contains A, B and let's say C .... and C. 
And then we define a variable let's say called y,  
which is the ... which is the height of each bar. 
For example we have 40 and let's say 50 and 10.  
So after that, you say plt.bar, because we want 
to plot a bar plot and we pass x and y to this  
function. So this is a bar plot. And because 
the face color, I mean the interior color  
of these bars are light gray, so we say fc, I mean 
face color, fc stands for face color. The face  
color ... you want to set the face color to light 
gray and the edge color (ec) ... the edge color  
is black ... the edge color is black! So there it 
is! And after that, we say plt.show() for showing  
our chart. If you run the code, you can see that 
here is a bar chart in python. But we want to add  
these labels on each bar. So in order to explain 
how to add a text like this above each bar, we  
need to take a step-by-step process in explaining 
this. So suppose that we want to add a "hello"  
text above the first bar. For example let's say 
we want to add this text, I mean "hello" text,  
in this point, I mean in this red point. So 
we say plt.txt, because we want to add a text.  
But where do we want to put the text? We want to 
put the text in this point! But could you please  
tell me what is the x-coordinate of this point, I 
mean this red point? Yes! it is 0. And could you  
again please tell me what is the y-coordinate of 
this point? Yes! it is ... it is the height of the  
first bar. The height of the first bar is y[0]. 
So this is ... so this is the coordinates of this  
point. This is the x-coordinate of this point and 
this is the y-coordinate of this point. And then  
we should say what a text that ... we should say 
the text that we want to put here! So for example,  
maybe we want to add "hello" in this place, so 
if you run the code you can see that here is a  
text above this bar. But we should notice to the 
alignment of this text. So for example we say  
horizontal alignment (ha) is equal to "center" 
... is equal to "center"! And the vertical  
alignment (va) is equal to "bottom". So if we 
run the code, you can see that we have a "hello"  
text above the first bar. But if you want to 
add hello above each bar ... above each bar,  
we can use a for loop. So we say for i in range 
of length of x ... length of x, then we add a text  
above each bar. But notice that we should change 
these two "i"s. So we say we want to add a text  
in this place and the text for example should be 
"hello". So if we run the code, you can see that  
we have a "hello" on each bar. But maybe you 
want to change these labels to the height of  
each bar! So if you want to change this "hello" 
to the height of each bar, you simply say y[i],  
because y[i] is the height of each bar. So if 
you run the code, you can see that we have the  
labels for each bar. But maybe you say: okay for 
example I want to set the y limit of this chart,  
for example to be 0 till 55. So you can do it! 
For example, we can say here ... for example  
we can say plt.ylim, I mean the limit of the 
y axis to be 0 to 55. And if you run a code,  
you can see that here it is and here's how to 
plot labels on the bar plot. So here's how to  
add labels above each bar of a bar plot (=Bar 
Chart). So please make sure to subscribe and
