These 2 lines are the fallback for any browser that doesn't do gradients.
The final line sets a background image and gradient for browsers that can handle them.
See [http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-gradients (hyper-link)] for browser support.
In this case, the image is on TOP of the gradient.
Stacking images ONLY (no gradients in the declaration) For IE < 9
You could use this to create a gradient image for ie9, though personally, I wouldn't.
This does not happen when a gradient is included.
If only 1 value is supplied, that will be applied to all stacked images including the gradient.
background-size: 40px; will constrain both the image and the gradient to 40px height and width.
However using background-size: 40px, cover; will make the image 40px and the gradient will cover the element.
That means, to have a background gradient behind an image, you would need:
I put together a blog post about some interesting things you can do with [CSS3 gradients (hyper-link)]
While background-color and background-image exist on separate layers within an object -- meaning they can co-exist -- CSS gradients seem to co-opt the background-image layer.
Seems Petra Gregorova has something working here --> [http://petragregorova.com/demos/css-gradient-and-bg-image-final.html (hyper-link)]
I define Gradient in HTML and background image in the Body
Where xxxxxx corresponds with the color that matches the final gradient color.
You could also fix this to the bottom of the screen and have it match the initial gradient color.
If you have to get gradients and background images working together in IE 9 (HTML 5 & HTML 4.01 Strict), add the following attribute declaration to your css class and it should do the trick:
Also notice that when you look at the fiddle the gradient extends beyond the rounded corners.
I wanted to make span button with background image, background gradient combination.
If you place image URL before gradient, this image will be displayed above the gradient as expected.
If you place gradient before image URL, this image will be displayed under the gradient.
Here are modern mixins that I use (credits: [PSA: don't use gradient generators (hyper-link)]):
You could use multiple background: linear-gradient(); calls, but try this:
I used this technique to fuse a wafer looking texture and other image data that's serialized with a standard rgba transparency / linear gradient css rule.
If you want a gradient with a single background image in the center, you can do it with one line of code like this:
(modified base from [gradient editor (hyper-link)] with black to transparent vertical gradient on top of image)
That or at least set a default background color that is the end gradient color as well.
Here's what I did to solve this problem... it will show the gradient for the full length of the content, then simply fallback to the background color (normally the last color in the gradient).
if I remove the bgcolor of html, when I scroll down, the gradient is cut.

Set gradient on HTML instead of BODY.
I found it worked better to fix a full-size div in the body, give it a negative z-index, and attach the gradient to it.
All you need to do is use min-height: 100%; rather than height: 100%; and your gradient background will extend the entire height of the viewport without repeating, even if the content is scrollable.
Mozilla currently only supports CSS gradients as values of the background-image  property, as well as within the shorthand background.
— [https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/-moz-linear-gradient (hyper-link)]
WebKit now (and Chrome 12 at least) supports gradients as border image:
Prooflink -- [http://www.webkit.org/blog/1424/css3-gradients/ (hyper-link)]
Browser support: [http://caniuse.com/#search=border-image (hyper-link)]
instead of borders, I would use background gradients and padding.
It's a hack, but you can achieve this effect in some cases by using the background-image to specify the gradient and then masking the actual background with a box-shadow.
From: [http://blog.nateps.com/the-elusive-css-border-gradient (hyper-link)]
[Webkit supports gradients in borders (hyper-link)], and now accepts the gradient in the Mozilla format.
Firefox claims to support gradients in two ways:
For example, suppose you want a 5px-wide left border that is a linear gradient from blue to white.
Create the gradient as an image and export to a PNG.
List any other CSS backgrounds after the one for the left border gradient:
You can adapt this technique to top, right, and bottom border gradients by changing the background position part of the background shorthand property.
For cross-browser support you can try as well imitate a gradient border with :before or :after pseudo elements, depends on what you want to do.
Here's a nice semi cross-browser way to have gradient borders that fade out half way down.
More here: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/linear-gradient (hyper-link)]
Gradient Borders from Css-Tricks: [http://css-tricks.com/examples/GradientBorder/ (hyper-link)]
This (as I understand it) prevents the default slicing of the "image" into sections - without it, nothing appears if the border is on one side only, and if it's around the entire element four tiny gradients appear in each corner.
There is a nice css tricks article about this here: [https://css-tricks.com/gradient-borders-in-css/ (hyper-link)]
Example for Gradient Border
You can use whatever linear-gradient or repeat-gradient you want.
The border-image slice property needs to be 1 for linear gradient.

Try removing android:gradientRadius="90".
I would check your alpha channel on your gradient colors.
For example in drawable/gradient.xml:
Remember to add gradient.xml as background in your layout xml:
I don't know if this will help anybody, but my problem was I was trying to set the gradient to the "src" property of an ImageView like so:
In your layout file: android:background="@drawable/gradient_background"
With this solution, it's finished the gradient shapes of all colors in your projects:
I also create an open source project [GradientView (hyper-link)] with this custom view:
[https://github.com/lopspower/GradientView (hyper-link)]
If you insist on using a Shape, try the site below (Select Android at bottom left):

Then you need to mention above gradient in the background of layout.As follows
You can create this 'half-gradient' look by using an xml [Layer-List (hyper-link)] to combine the top and bottom 'bands' into one file.

In order to create a gradient, you create an xml file in res/drawable.
I am calling mine my_gradient_drawable.xml:
Set the gradientRadius for a radial type.
What you are looking for is CAGradientLayer.
One specific type is the CAGradientLayer, where you give it an array of colors to gradiate between.
One example is this simple wrapper for a gradient view:
[http://oleb.net/blog/2010/04/obgradientview-a-simple-uiview-wrapper-for-cagradientlayer/ (hyper-link)]
Info: use startPoint and endPoint to [change direction of gradient (hyper-link)].
If there are any other views added onto this UIView (such as a UILabel), you may want to consider setting the background color of those UIView’s to [UIColor clearColor] so the gradient view is presented instead of the background color for sub views.
To promote reusability, I'd say create a category of CAGradientLayer and add your desired gradients as class methods.
Then in your implementation file, specify each gradient with this syntax :
Since I only needed one type of gradient throughout my app I created a subclass of UIView and preconfigured the gradient layer on initialization with fixed colors.
The initializers of UIView call the configureGradientLayer-method, which configures the CAGradientLayer:
DDGradientView.h:
DDGradientView.m:
This answer builds on the answers above and provides implementation for dealing with the problem of the gradient not being properly applied during rotation.
It satisfies this problem by changing the gradient layer to a square so that rotation in all directions results in a correct gradient.
Also provided is an example as a Swift extension so that one can apply a gradient to any UIView.
Which means the gradient background can now be applied to any UIControl since all controls are UIViews (or a subclass) and all UIViews have CALayers.
You can create a custom class GradientView:
In the storyboard, set the class type to any view that you want to have gradient background:
Then you can use gradientLayer after initialization like this...
No I can set a gradient on every view like this:
Now I can see a gradient on my view.
I have set RGB gradient background Color to UIview
You can add starting and end point of gradient color.
For more details description refer [CAGradientLayer Doc (hyper-link)]
My solution is to create UIView subclass with CAGradientLayer accessible as a readonly property.
This will allow you to customize your gradient how you want and you don't need to handle layout changes yourself.
To add a gradient layer on your view
Define the CAGradientLayer()
[code snippet]
Here is the code you have to write in your viewDidLoad
YOURVIEW.layoutIfNeeded()
gradient.startPoint = CGPoint(x: CGFloat(0), y: CGFloat(1))
    gradient.endPoint = CGPoint(x: CGFloat(1), y: CGFloat(0))
    gradient.frame = YOURVIEW.bounds
    gradient.colors = [UIColor.red.cgColor, UIColor.green.cgColor]
    gradient.colors = [ UIColor(red: 255.0/255.0, green: 56.0/255.0, blue: 224.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0).cgColor,UIColor(red: 86.0/255.0, green: 13.0/255.0, blue: 232.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0).cgColor,UIColor(red: 16.0/255.0, green: 173.0/255.0, blue: 245.0/255.0, alpha: 1.0).cgColor]
    gradient.locations = [0.0 ,0.6 ,1.0]
    YOURVIEW.layer.insertSublayer(gradient, at: 0)
Oh and if you are using Storyboard like I do, make sure to call gradientBackground(from:to:direction:) in viewDidLayoutSubviews() or later.
Shows gradient in IB correctly:
To give gradient color to UIView (swift 4.2)
Gradients don't support transitions yet (although the current spec says they should support like gradient to like gradient transitions via interpolation.
If you want a fade-in effect with a background gradient, you have to set an opacity on a container element and 'transition` the opacity.
(There have been some browser releases that supported transitions on gradients (e.g IE10.
I tested gradient transitions in 2016 in IE and they seemed to work at the time, but my test code no longer works.)
Update: October 2018
Gradient transitions with un-prefixed new syntax [e.g.
radial-gradient(...)]now confirmed to work (again?)
One work-around is to transition the background position to give the effect that the gradient is changing:
[http://sapphion.com/2011/10/css3-gradient-transition-with-background-position/ (hyper-link)]
Although you can’t directly animate gradients using the CSS transition property, it is possible to animate the background-position property to achieve a simple gradient animation:
Gradients aren't currently supported with CSS Transitions.
You can FAKE transitions between gradients, using transitions in the opacity of a few stacked gradients, as described in a few of the answers here:
[CSS3 animation with gradients (hyper-link)].
[CSS3 gradient transition with background-position (hyper-link)].
[Animating CSS3 Gradients (hyper-link)].
A solution is to use background-position to mimic the gradient transition.
[http://codersblock.blogspot.fr/2013/12/gradient-animation-trick.html?showComment=1390287622614 (hyper-link)]
The grandchild has the far background gradient.
The child in the near background is transparent, but has the gradient to transition to.
Partial workaround for gradient transition is to use inset box shadow - you can transition either the box shadow itself, or the background color - e.g.
if you create inset box shadow of the same color as background and than use transition on background color, it creates illusion that plain background is changing to radial gradient
Wrote a lightweight jQuery plugin with which you can define a background radial gradient and a transition speed.
Found a nice hack on codepen that modifies the opacity property but achieves that fade from one gradient to another by leveraging pseudo-elements.
Gradient fade from left to right.
I discovered that gradient background colors don't transition (yet).
I placed a radial gradient background in front of the element (using z-index) with a transitioning solid background.
@include gradientAnimation(red, blue, .6s);
Taken from this awesome post on Medium from Dave Lunny: [https://medium.com/@dave_lunny/animating-css-gradients-using-only-css-d2fd7671e759 (hyper-link)]
Set initial gradient colors to the variables and also set the transition of those variables:
target the element and set it's default gradient using background-image
targeting the same element, use ::before to set it's next gradient with background-image and it's opacity to zero
  use now :hover::before and set opacity to 1
Back on the ::before block use: 

position absolute
content: ""
a lower z-index than the default element
set top, bottom, right and left to zero
set transition attribute targeting the opacity property
Now everything should be done and you can tweak your transition  with whatever duration / delay / timing-function you like!
Have you tried to overlay one gradient with a nearly-transparent opacity for the highlight on top of another image with an opaque opacity for the green gradient?
Edit: Also, the 0, 0, 0, theButton.getHeight() refers to the x0, y0, x1, y1 coordinates of the gradient.
So basically, it starts at x = 0 (left side), y = 0 (top), and stretches to x = 0 (we're wanting a vertical gradient, so no left to right angle is necessary), y = the height of the button.
So the gradient goes at a 90 degree angle from the top of the button to the bottom of the button.
green_horizontal_gradient.xml
Okay, so basically I've created a shape gradient in XML for the horizontal green gradient, set at a 0 degree angle, going from the top area's left green color, to the right green color.
I put the green gradient as the bottom layer, then put the half overlay as the second layer, offset from the top by 50dp.
You can layer gradient shapes in the xml using a layer-list.
This blog posting helped me: [http://abouthalf.com/2010/10/25/internet-explorer-9-gradients-with-rounded-corners/ (hyper-link)]
Basically, you use a conditional comment to remove the filter and then create SVG 'sprites' of gradients which you can use as background images.
My suggestion would be to use a repeated background image for the gradient in ie9.
SVG is cool and all, but why go through all that when easier solutions for gradient backgrounds have been around for years.
Of course, that might be overkill if you're just depending on a single element with rounded corners and a background gradient, but it is an option to consider if you're incorporating a number of common CSS3 features on your pages and want easy support for IE6+
Here's one solution that adds a background gradient, using a data URI to create a semi-transparent image that overlays any background color.
I grabbed a random 20x20 gradient PNG via a web search, and converted it into a data URI using an online tool.
Of course, generating a PNG works great for button-sized gradients, but not page-sized gradients!
Another "solution" is to add a div around the item that has the gradient and rounded corners.
I think it's worth mentioning that in many cases you can use an inset box-shadow to "fake" the gradient effect and avoid the ugly edges in IE9.
You could use shadow to achieve gradient, and is going to work on Internet Explorer 9 with border-radius
IE9 handles border-radius and gradients together properly.
The problem is that IE9 renders the filter proper in addition to the gradient.
I also got stuck in the same problem n found that IE can't render the border radius and gradient both at a time, it both conflicts, the only way to solve this headache is to remove the filter and use the gradient via svg code, just for IE ..
you can get the svg code by using their gradient color code, from Microsoft this site (specially made for gradient to svg):
[http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/graphics/svggradientbackgroundmaker/default.html (hyper-link)]
Second pseudo-Element sets the Background Gradient.
This example displays a horizontal gradient from white to black to white.
You can get a circular gradient using android:type="radial":
The images above were generated by changing the gradientRadius in this code
my_gradient_drawable

Radius of the gradient, used only with radial gradient.
Here is my Kotlin snippet to create a drawable radial gradient:
Here is the complete xml with gradient, stoke & circular shape.
Of course, this requires that you have defined the linear gradient somewhere in your SVG.
Here is how to set a linearGradient on a target element:
Here is a solution where you can add a gradient and change its colours using only CSS:
Building on top of what Finesse wrote, here is a simpler way to target the svg and change it's gradient.
Assign classes to each color stop defined in the gradient element.
Just set a named variable for each stop in gradient and then customize as you like in css.
Using the svg in a shadow dom, I add the 3 linear gradients I need within the svg, inside a  .
The Colors you're providing to gradient must be of type CGColor.
And if you need to change the direction of the gradient you have to use startPoint and endPoint.
I made an UIView extension to apply a basic gradient to any view
GradientView.swift
gradientView.colors = [UIColor.blackColor().colorWithAlphaComponent(0.8), UIColor.clearColor()]
You can design your own Gradient View as follow:
Cleaner code that lets you pass any UIColor to an instance of the GradientLayer class:
It will remove any previous gradients before inserting one and it will return the newly inserted gradient layer for further manipulation if needed:
Just Specify the Frame of the View, where you want to show the gradient color.
You can add starting and end point of gradient color.

There is a library called Chameleon ([https://github.com/viccalexander/Chameleon (hyper-link)]) which one can use for gradient colors.
It even has styles of gradient to implement.
To add gradient into layer, add:
One thing I noticed is you can't add a gradient to a UILabel without clearing the text.
SwiftUI: You can use the LinearGradient struct as the first element in a ZStack.
AngularGradient and RadialGradient are also available.
If anybody is looking for a quick and easy way to add a gradient to a view:
You can use Core Graphics to draw the gradient, as pointed to in Mike's response.
This particular example creates a white, glossy-style gradient that is drawn from the top of the UIView to its vertical center.
You can also draw a radial gradient using the CGContextDrawRadialGradient function.
You could also use a graphic image one pixel wide as the gradient, and set the view property to expand the graphic to fill the view (assuming you are thinking of a simple linear gradient and not some kind of radial graphic).
The image the ImageView is pointing to is a gradient.
Then I set a background color in the UIView, and I have a colored gradient view.
Next I use the view as I need to and everything I draw will be under this gradient view.
By adding a second view on top of the ImageView, you can have some options whether your drawing will be below or above the gradient...
As of iPhone SDK 3.0, custom gradients can be implemented very easily, without subclassing or images, by using the new CAGradientLayer:
Take a look at the CAGradientLayer docs.
You can optionally specify start and end points (in case you don't want a linear gradient that goes straight from the top to the bottom), or even specific locations that map to each of the colors.
When using CAGradientLayer, as opposed to CGGradient, the gradient is not smooth, but has noticeable stepping to it.
To get more attractive results it is better to use CGGradient.
Gradient basically represents the variation in space(in a direction) of any quantity.

Specifies a gradient color for the shape.
The angle for the gradient, in degrees.

The trick is to specify a mask that is itself a gradient that ends as invisible (thru alpha value)
Except using [css mask (hyper-link)] answered by [@vals (hyper-link)], you can also use transparency gradient background and set background-clip to text.
Create proper gradient:
[https://caniuse.com/css-gradients (hyper-link)]
You need two layers: An ImageView, and a View on top of that with your gradient as android:background.
Your gradient xml file:
Gradient descent tries to find such a minimum x by using information from the first derivative of f: It simply follows the steepest descent from the current point.
Put simply, gradient descent you just take a small step towards where you think the zero is and then recalculate; Newton's method, you go all the way there.
If you simply compare Gradient Descent and Newton's method, the purpose of the two methods are different.
Gradient Descent is used to find(approximate) local maxima or minima (x to make min f(x) or max f(x)).
What if you apply the gradient to the background.
It involves putting a pseudo-element with a gradient background below and clipping that.
There is actually one way I found without pseudo classes - but it only works for radial gradients:
Getting a transparent element with pseudo classes I only found this way - ok it is not a gradient, but it is at least a multicolored striped border (looking like life-rings):
Then your problem will be solved (without a gradient situation):
More details: [https://dev.to/afif/border-with-gradient-and-radius-387f (hyper-link)]
You can achieve that effect using a combination of CSS [linear-gradient (hyper-link)] and [mix-blend-mode (hyper-link)].
What this does is add a linear gradient on the paragraph's ::after pseudo-element and make it cover the whole paragraph element.
But with mix-blend-mode: screen, the gradient will only show on parts where there is text.
Just modify the linear-gradient values to achieve what you want.
But I've got a gradient text example.
_you can also add more colors to the gradient if you want or just select other colors from the [color generator (hyper-link)]
[code snippet]
The element is given a background which is the gradient.
For example, in rainbow text sample (note that I've converted the gradient into the standard syntax):
The gradient starts at color #f22 at 0% (that is the left edge of the element).
At 14.25% (of the container's size), the color will exactly be #f2f as per the gradient specified.
So, we end up getting a gradient like in the below snippet.
Since, the gradient needs to be applied only to the text and not to the element on the whole, we need to instruct the browser to clip the background from the areas outside the text.
Now if you want the text to have a simple 3 color gradient (that is, say from red - orange - brown), we just need to change the linear-gradient specification as follows:
First parameter is the direction of the gradient.
Next step is to define the colors of the gradient.
Since our gradient should start as red on the left side, just specify red as the first color (percentage is assumed to be 0%).
Thus the gradient's specification should read as follows:
If we form the gradients using the above mentioned method and apply them to the element, we can get the required effect.

For me the banding disappeared when I set the android:useLevel="true" on the gradient:
gradient_dark.xml
The gradient of a function of two variables x, y is a vector of the partial derivatives in the x and y direction.
So if your function is f(x,y), the gradient is the vector (f_x, f_y).
An image is a discrete function of (x,y), so you can also talk about the gradient of an image.
The gradient of the image has two components: the x-derivative and the y-derivative.
So, you can represent the gradient of an image either an x-derivative image and a y-derivative image, or as direction image and a magnitude image.
As explained by [Dima (hyper-link)] in his [answer (hyper-link)], you should be familiar with the mathematical concept of [gradient (hyper-link)] in order to better understand the gradient in the field of image processing.
you can compute an approximation of the gradient of this image.
As Dima explained in his answer, you have two component of the gradient, an horizontal and a vertical component.
You can now combine the two components in order to get the magnitude of the gradient and the orientation of the gradient.
The following image is the magnitude of the gradient:
So, when you look at the image of the magnitude of the gradient you can say "if the image is bright it means a big change in the initial image; if it is dark it means no change or very llittle change".
The following image is the orientation of the gradient:
Pay attention to the fact that, for the computation of the orientation, I use the function [cv::phase (hyper-link)] which, as explained in the [doc (hyper-link)], gives an angle of 0 when both the vertical component and the horizontal component of the gradient are zero; that may be convenient but from a mathematical point of view is plainly wrong because when both components are zero the orientation is not defined and the only meaningful value for an orientation kept in a floating-point C++ type is a NaN.
You would then need to place that <div> over the entire area of the <body> which should then give an appearance of a gradient with noise.
[http://lea.verou.me/2010/12/checkered-stripes-other-background-patterns-with-css3-gradients/ (hyper-link)]
You want noise in your gradient?
[Perlin noise (hyper-link)] is a type of gradient noise.
Later, however, we essentially combine this color with a translucent CSS gradient, which also defines a color(s).
But if you want a gradient, like the OP, go to Step 2.
Using the [background-image (hyper-link)] property, you can set the SVG noise graphic as the background on any element and overlay a [gradient (hyper-link)].
In this example, I'll apply the noise graphic to the entire body and overlay a [linear gradient (hyper-link)].
The linear-gradient() function creates a pseudo image, which is stacked on top of noise.svg.
The result is a translucent gradient with our noise showing through it.
First, and most obvious, is that the defined gradient colors can be changed.
However, if you want a solid color without a gradient, make the two end-point colors equal.
The benefit is that you can use the same noise graphic with or without a gradient throughout a site or among projects.
Multiple images, created with the [*-gradient() functions (hyper-link)], can be overlayed on the noise graphic and more than two color parameters and angles can be specified in a single gradient function to provide all kinds of cool visuals.
The opacity of the gradient parameters—i.e.
This is a highly customizable and very light-weight (~400 bytes) solution that allows you to simply define noise of any color or gradient.
I found a way without any image with radial-gradient and only one div.
Firstly I want to show an example with radial-gradient.
We are going to write a @mixin function for thousands line gradients.
Building on top of Clint Pachl's answer, I used CSS's mix-blend-mode to get a grainier effect and to selectively punch up the colors of that make up the gradient.
It doesn't appear possible to extend TextView to draw text with a gradient.
You can create GradientTextView in XML or just use GradientTextView.setGradient(TextView textView...) to do it on a regular TextView object.
Here is an example for linearlayout, you can use this example for textview too, and in the source code there wont be gradient coding, you get the source code and add the code from that site itself - [http://android-codes-examples.blogspot.com/2011/07/design-linearlayout-or-textview-and-any.html (hyper-link)]
Also, if you wish to use a bitmap of the gradient, instead or a real one, use:
I have used the top answer(@Taras) with a gradient of 5 colors, but there is a problem: the textView looks like that I have put a white cover on it.
After many hours, I found out that I need to call textView.setTextColor() with the first color of the gradient.
Styled your gradient text.
[https://github.com/veeyaarVR/SuperGradientTextView (hyper-link)]
After many hours, I found out that I need to call textView.setTextColor() with the first color of the gradient.
Then we can apply the shader, and it will be applied on top of the white so we will get the desired gradient color.
Extension for setting vertical gradient:
Gradient clipping needs to happen after computing the gradients, but before applying them to update the model's parameters.
In order to clip your gradients you'll need to explicitly compute, clip, and apply them as described in [this section in TensorFlow's API documentation (hyper-link)].
Despite what seems to be popular, you probably want to clip the whole gradient by its global norm:
Clipping each gradient matrix individually changes their relative scale but is also possible:
In TensorFlow 2, a tape computes the gradients, the optimizers come from Keras, and we don't need to store the update op because it runs automatically without passing it to a session:
Calling minimize() takes care of both computing the gradients and
  applying them to the variables.
If you want to process the gradients
  before applying them you can instead use the optimizer in three steps:
Compute the gradients with compute_gradients().
Process the gradients as you wish.
Apply the processed gradients with apply_gradients().
Here MyCapper is any function that caps your gradient.
For those who would like to understand the idea of gradient clipping (by norm):
Whenever the gradient norm is greater than a particular threshold, we clip the gradient norm so that it stays within the threshold.
Let the gradient be g and the max_norm_threshold be j.
Gradient Clipping basically helps in case of exploding or vanishing gradients.Say your loss is too high which will result in exponential gradients to flow through the network which may result in Nan values .
To overcome this we clip gradients within a specific range (-1 to 1 or any range as per condition) .
where grads _and_vars are the pairs of gradients (which you calculate via tf.compute_gradients) and their variables they will be applied to.
optimizer.apply_gradients(clipped_value)
IMO the best solution is wrapping your optimizer with TF's estimator decorator tf.contrib.estimator.clip_gradients_by_norm:
This way you only have to define this once, and not run it after every gradients calculation.
Documentation:
[https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/estimator/clip_gradients_by_norm (hyper-link)]
This optimizer will clip all gradients to values between [-1.0, 1.0].
This type of gradient is not easy to achieve in SVG, see [SVG angular gradient (hyper-link)].
Another way is to make two half circles and apply the opposite linear gradient to each's stroke, and make sure they are both contained in a g element.
(In my example the combined gradient isn't 270 degrees but 360.
The first gradient (applied to the top semi-circle's stroke) would be 100-50% opacity, then the next would have 0% to 50%.
Both gradients have the unit vector set to x1,y1,y2=0 and x2=1, making them run from left to right.)
Basically, this technique uses [getPointAtLength (hyper-link)] to slice the stroke into many short strokes, specify interpolated color stops for each, and then apply a gradient to each short stroke between those stops.
I had this problem as well, so [I created a library to assist (hyper-link)] in the creation of gradients that follow along a path.
Here is an example of how a LinearGradientShader is used in Compose on a paint object.
You can also add a gradient to the AppBar like this,
LinearGradient parameters:
colors: an array of the colors to be used in the gradient, in this case, two shades of blue.
As we want an horizontal gradient, we use same Y for both measures, and the x changes from 0.0 (left) to 1.0 (right).
In this case, we added clamp (it will reuse the last color used), but as our gradient goes from 0.0 to 1.0, it’s not really necessary.
Then the app bar is a gradient in the background.
I used this piece of code to set background color as a gradient
You can use directly below code for gradient color of any container or view
Sadly, you really can't transition gradients for now.
So, the only workable workaround is using an extra element with needed gradient and transition it's opacity:
You can fake gradient transitions using drop shadows!
Here, you are essentially using an inset shadow as a Photoshop-like mask, causing a gradient effect on the underlying element.
You can just nudge the gradient down a bit and have the background-color be the same as the top color of your gradient: [http://cdpn.io/oaByI (hyper-link)]
I know this question is pretty old, but I found a good way to animate basic gradients that will work in some cases.
This method will let you animate a change in color of the gradient but not a change in the position of the color stops.
First Make gradient on ":before and hide it with opacity then transition opacity 1 on hover.
Gradients are [image values (hyper-link)], not [color values (hyper-link)].
Since gradients in CSS3 only make use of color stops, you can't nest them like that.
You'll want to find a gradient or image editor that can help you visualize what the final gradient would look like (because I don't know what you want it to look like), and that could possibly generate the corresponding single linear gradient for you.
From what I see, though, it looks like a multidirectional gradient.
In that case, you'll either want to use [layered backgrounds (hyper-link)] (with one gradient per layer), or even an actual image instead.
It's done with multiple background "images" (gradients).
Each one can be controlled via:
[code snippet]
if you've 2 images/gradients you want to style.
gradients added to :before and :after pseudos.
See for example a previous answer of mine and the fiddle: [Showing two different gradients as a background using CSS?
(hyper-link)] 
It seems you can't add gradients via content: url() url(), only images (any valid value for url()).
This means to back propagate errors, you have to keep track of the gradients of your computation and then apply these gradients to an optimiser.
Fundamentally, because tensors are evaluated immediately, you don't have a graph to calculate gradients and so you need a gradient tape.
It is not so much that it is just used for visualisation, but more that you cannot implement a gradient descent in eager mode without it.
Obviously, Tensorflow could just keep track of every gradient for every computation on every tf.Variable.
They expose a gradient tape so that you can control what areas of your code need the gradient information.
Having worked on this for a while, after posting the initial question, I have a better sense of where Gradient Tape is useful.
Seems like the most useful application of Gradient Tap is when you design a custom layer in your keras model for example--or equivalently designing a custom training loop for your model.
If you have a custom layer, you can define exactly how the operations occur within that layer, including the gradients that are computed and also calculating the amount of loss that is accumulated.
So Gradient tape will just give you direct access to the individual gradients that are in the layer.
So the optimizer will calculate the gradient and give you access to those values.
Whatever you choose to do, then you can add those adjusted gradients to the loss calculation for the backpropagation step, etc.
I think the most important thing to say in answer to this question is simply that GradientTape is not a diagnostic tool.
GradientTape is a mathematical tool for automatic differentiation (autodiff), which is the core functionality of TensorFlow.
As the other answers describe, it is used to record ("tape") a sequence of operations performed upon some input and producing some output, so that the output can be differentiated with respect to the input (via backpropagation / reverse-mode autodiff) (in order to then perform gradient descent optimisation).
There's no standard support to do angular (conical) gradients.
But see [http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Advanced_Gradients#Conical_gradient (hyper-link)] for some approximation methods (source code not included, though).
Here is a possible vector conical gradient, but only VML (+IE) can do it...:
In my answer to this similar question, I used six linear gradients to approximate a conical gradient.
If you are only needing the gradient for the stroke/perimeter of a circle, rather than the fill, then it should be a good enough approximation.
If you dig into [this page (hyper-link)], you'll find code that approximates a conic gradient in SVG by drawing it as a series of 1 degree arcs.
CSS now supports conical gradients, although [browser support is mixed (hyper-link)] at the time of writing this.
You could apply a <clipPath /> to a <foreignObject /> whose contents use a CSS conical gradient to achieve the desired effect.
[clip_grad_norm (hyper-link)] (which is actually deprecated in favor of clip_grad_norm_ following the more consistent syntax of a trailing _ when in-place modification is performed) clips the norm of the overall gradient by concatenating all parameters passed to the function, as can be seen from [the documentation (hyper-link)]:
The norm is computed over all gradients together, as if they were concatenated into a single vector.
Gradients are modified in-place.
From your example it looks like that you want [clip_grad_value_ (hyper-link)] instead which has a similar syntax and also modifies the gradients in-place:
This takes the current gradient as an input and may return a tensor which will be used in-place of the previous gradient, i.e.
This hook is called each time after a gradient has been computed, i.e.
Isn't this [gradient (hyper-link)] the one you're trying to reproduce?
EDIT: what I did to reproduce your gradient:
below the name of the gradient is the gradient panel with 4 color stops by default.
below the gradient, delete the 2 color stops at ~50% and keep those on left and right.
The black ones above are for opacity, ignore them for this opaque gradient
You or your colleagues will thank yourself in 6 months when you want to change slightly this gradient or when you'll have to update your gradients because of Browser version 18.0.
[http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/ (hyper-link)]
There are many limited gradient generators available on the net but they can't create the SVG (IE9) code or old Webkit code for complex gradients that involve repeats, angles, explicit positions etc.
There's a small app at [VisualCSSTools (hyper-link)] that will create the code for all CSS linear and radial gradients.
The only limitation is that the old Webkit syntax does not allow elliptical radial gradients; these are converted to circular gradients.
Keep in mind that a CSS gradient is actually an [image value (hyper-link)], not a color value as some might expect.
Essentially, what you're really trying to do is layering two background images: a bitmap image over a gradient.
Specify the image first, followed by the gradient.
If you specify a background color, that color will always be painted underneath the bottom-most image, which means a gradient will cover it just fine, and it will work even in the case of a fallback.
Because you're including vendor prefixes, you will need to do this once for every prefix, once for prefixless, and once for fallback (without the gradient).
Unfortunately this doesn't work correctly in IE as it uses filter for the gradient, which it always paints over the background.
If you don't need to support versions of IE that don't implement standardized CSS gradients, you have nothing to worry about.
1 Technically, the background-position and background-repeat declarations apply to both layers here because the gaps are filled in by repeating the values instead of clamped, but since background-position is its initial value and background-repeat doesn't matter for a gradient covering the entire element, it doesn't matter too much.
The order of the image and gradient is very KEY here, i want to make that clear.
The gradient/image combo works best like this...
the gradient needs to come first... to go on top.
The absolute key here though is that the gradient uses at least 1 RGBA color... the color(s) need to be transparent to let the image come through.
putting the gradient first in you css places the gradient on top of the image, so the lower the alpha setting on you RGBAs the more you see the image.
Now on the other hand if you use the reverse order the PNG needs to have transparent properties, just like the gradient, to let the gradient shine through.
The image goes on top so your PNG needs to be saved as a 24 bit in photoshop with alpha areas... or a 32 bit in fireworks with alpha areas (or a gif i guess... barf), so you can see the gradient underneath.
In this case the gradient can use HEX RGB or RGBA.
You can use [Transparency and gradients (hyper-link)].
Gradients support transparency.
To do this in code, you create a GradientDrawable.
If you want to change the color or angle, just create a new GradientDrawable and set it as the background
Check here for more examples:
[How do I combine a background-image and CSS3 gradient on the same element?
The mask image (In this case a linear-gradient) is set on the parent element (.image_preview_container).
The [xolor library (hyper-link)] has a gradient function.
This will create an array with 8 colors in a gradient from a start color to an end color:
Here's a ready-made function to set an elements background to be a gradient
There is a JavaScript library which can create color gradients:
[javascript-color-gradient (hyper-link)]
So if you request ten colours returned, you get the first from colour + 8 gradient colours + the final to colour.
You can do this with a single element by adjusting the linear-gradient.
(overflow:hidden will cut off the remaining parts) On the child element gradient is applied.
Basically the body has a horizontal gradient and then the pseudo element becomes a white triangle overlay.
At first fill it with the gradient and then clip it.
You can also lay 2 gradients on top of each others (keywords i react on :gradient within gradient)
It includes gradient in stroke as well as a gradient in fill colour.
[http://css-tricks.com/examples/CSS3Gradient/ (hyper-link)]
[http://css-tricks.com/css3-gradients/ (hyper-link)]
If you wish to do this using CSS3 gradients, try using the [background-attachment property (hyper-link)]
For example, if you are applying your gradients to #background, then add this after the CSS gradient.
The top bit is insignificant since this is a horizontal linear gradient.
(hyper-link)] Note that since the notation that you have is a WebKit invention, it only exists as -webkit-gradient() and thus can only be seen in a WebKit-based browser such as Safari or Chrome.
Since you want to calculate the gradient of an analytical function, you have to use the [Sympy (hyper-link)] package which supports symbolic mathematics.
Afterwards you feed this table of function values to numpy.gradient to get an array with the numerical derivative for every dimension (variable).
This is essentially, what numpy.gradient [is doing (hyper-link)] for every point of your predefined grid.
Also theano can compute the gradient automatically
[http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/tutorial/gradients.html (hyper-link)]
Numpy doesn't directly support gradient calculations without creating an entire grid of points.
Use [simple_gradient_text (hyper-link)] package and create GradienText
If you custom code your gradient, interpolate the colors in HSV, not in RVB !
At this point, the gradient pattern will follow the shape outline.
If you can draw gradient pixel-by-pixel, then you need just to remember that for
circle gradient color is proportional to r
ellipse (oval) gradient color is proportional to r1+r2
You can create an [svg file with a radial gradient (hyper-link)], and set it as the background using background-image: url()
You can create a png or jpg of the gradient, and set it the same way as above
You can use background-size: contain to make the gradient fit itself to the size of the circle (or ellipse!
), just make sure to make the gradient of high enough resolution that it will never get pixellated.
As of now, there is no standardized or widely supported syntax for radial gradients.
Your best bet to do this with CSS is to use a CSS generator (such as [http://westciv.com/tools/radialgradients/ (hyper-link)] or [http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/ (hyper-link)]).
Gradient Descent is used to minimize a particular function whereas gradient ascent is used to maximize a function.
Gradient ascent is just the process of maximizing, instead of minimizing, a loss function.
Ascent for some loss function, you could say, is like gradient descent on the negative of that loss function.
Typically, you'd use gradient ascent to maximize a likelihood function, and gradient descent to minimize a cost function.
Both gradient descent and ascent are practically the same.
Let me give you an concrete example using a simple gradient-based optimization friendly algorithm with a concav/convex likelihood/cost function: logistic regression.
Now, you want to a concav funcion for gradient ascent, thus take the log:
Similarly, you can just write it as its inverse to get the cost function that you can minimize via gradient descent.
For the log-likelihood, you'd derive and apply the gradient ascent as follows:
Now, it should be quite obvious to see that the gradient descent update is the same as the gradient ascent one, only keep in mind that we are formulating it as "taking a step into the opposite direction of the gradient of the cost function"
Gradient is another word for slope.
The positive gradient of the graph at a point (x,y) means that the graph slopes upwards at a point (x,y).
On the other hand, the negative gradient of the graph at a point (x,y)  means that the graph slopes downwards at a point (x,y).
Gradient descent is an iterative algorithm which is used to find a set of theta that minimizes the value of a cost function.
Therefore, gradient ascent would produce a set of theta that maximizes the value of a cost function.
If you want to minimize a function, we use Gradient Descent.
in Deep learning we want to minimize the loss function hence we use Gradient Descent.
If you want to maximize a function, we use Gradient Ascent.
in Reinforcement Learning - Policy Gradient methods our goal is to maximize the reward/expected return function hence we use Gradient Ascent.
gradient ascent is maximizing of the function so as to achieve better optimization
used in reinforcement learning
it gives upward slope or increasing graph.
gradient descent is minimizing the cost function
used in linear regression
it provides a downward or decreasing slope of cost function.
Basically each gradient will be half width and full height.
You can combine the two gradients into background: linear-gradient(to right, #f4c05b, #fcd580, #f4c05b 50%, #aa0507 50%, #e0171e, #aa0507) to get the effect - note that the gradients on the both left / right sections are left to right in this answer.
The three values are the gradients at the output of the network.
Then you can compute the gradient of loss w.r.t.
loss=[loss1, loss2, loss3]), you can compute the gradients of loss w.r.t.
In order to update the parameters of the network, we need to calculate the gradient of loss w.r.t to the parameters, which is actually leaf node in the computation graph (by the way, these parameters are mostly the weight and bias of various layers such Convolution, Linear and so on).
According to chain rule, in order to calculate gradient of loss w.r.t to a leaf node, we can compute derivative of loss w.r.t some intermediate variable, and gradient of intermediate variable w.r.t to the leaf variable, do a dot product and sum all these up.
The gradient arguments of a Variable's [backward() (hyper-link)] method is used to calculate a weighted sum of each element of a Variable w.r.t the [leaf Variable (hyper-link)].
The problem with the code above there is no function based on what to calculate the gradients.
You can think of the gradients = torch.FloatTensor([0.1, 1.0, 0.0001]) like this is the accumulator.
However, this [Jacobian (hyper-link)] is not how PyTorch is doing things to calculate the gradients at certain point.
If you don't use gradients in y.backward():
Also, note gradients are like accumulators so zero them when needed.
PyTorch creates a dynamic computational graph when calculating the gradients in forward pass.
Gradients are calculated by tracing the graph from the root to the leaf and multiplying every gradient in the way using the chain rule.
CSS gradients are at the mercy of the various rendering engines of the browsers.
The best you can do is short areas to cover and larger color ranges to increase the gradient steps.... Then wait for browser rending to improve.
If it's a simple linear gradient, then you only need it to be 1px wide and as high as the gradient, then make the background colour of the page as the final colour of the gradient so it runs smoothly.
If you want to reduce gradient bands in your image, use a PNG (not transparency) as I find these to be better suited than JPG's for this purpose.
You can yield slightly better results by making your gradient go from the first colour to transparent, with a background-color underneath for your second colour.
I'd also recommend playing around with background-size for large gradients that stretch across the screen, so the gradient doesn't actually fill the whole screen.
I made a "scatter.png" to put with my gradient.
Save and then add to gradient.
For a pure CSS answer you can use a blur filter to add blur to the css gradient and alleviate the banding.
I know this issue is long solved, but for others experiencing banding and looking for a solution, a very easy fix for me was just simplifying the colours I included in my gradient.
This gradient produces banding:
This gradient does not, and looks much the same:
I think you have to specify the symbolc variable you'd want the gradient to be calculated for, and specify f differently (have a look at the example):
[https://de.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/gradient.html (hyper-link)]
Also have a look at this question: [Matlab gradient and hessian computation for symbolic vector function (hyper-link)]
[gradient (hyper-link)] doesn't like function handles as input.
then typing gradient gives me a 5x1 array of symbolic expressions.
For gradient you can also use css3 as described in the following code generator
[http://gradients.glrzad.com/ (hyper-link)]
With this, you could have that view, place on top of your actual scrollview, and have your gradient view (if you will) "pass-on" all touch events (i.e.
This was an embarrassingly easy fix: apply a CAGradientLayer as my subview's mask.
It seems like serious overkill, but it was the only way I could find to do gradients with transparency.
One is a solid color, the other is a gradient that is used as an image mask.
Step 1 Define a custom gradient view (Swift 4):
Step 2 - Drag and drop a UIView in your storyboard and set its custom class to GradientView
As an example, this is how the above gradient view looks like:
[https://github.com/yzhong52/GradientViewDemo (hyper-link)]
The solution was to add the gradient layer as the superview's mask, not the scroll view's mask.
The following creates a gradient color bar with three pinpoints without any plot beforehand and no alien package is needed.
This still points on inconsistencies with how browser vendors are dealing with alpha transparency in CSS3 gradients.
[iOS White to Transparent Gradient Layer is Gray (hyper-link)]
[https://betterprogramming.pub/the-proper-way-of-creating-a-transparent-gradient-layer-in-ios-b082daa866b1layer-is-gray (hyper-link)]
The problem seems to be happening because of a difference in the way the angles are handled by the -moz linear gradient and the standard one.
-45deg in the -moz linear gradient seems to be equal to 135deg in the standard gradient (but changing the angle is resulting in a strange dot in the middle).
Output with -moz-linear-gradient:
Output with linear gradient:
It's 2020 and this can now be created with a single CSS gradient (if you don't need to support IE/ pre-Chromium Edge).
The code I use for all browser gradients:
Shows how to get gradients working in all browsers.
Note that IE10 will support gradients as follows:
A significant gotcha when it comes to gradients in IE is that although you can use Microsoft's filters...
...they kill clear type on any text covered by the gradient.
Given that the purpose of gradients is normally to make the UI look better, that's a show stopper for me.
If the background image css is combined with the gradient CSS for other browsers (as per Blowsie's answer), other browsers will ignore the background image in favour of the gradient css, so it will only end up applying to IE.
There are plenty of sites you can use to quickly generate a gradient background; I use [this (hyper-link)].
Great tool from Microsoft, allows you to examine colors real-time and generates CSS for all browsers:
[http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/graphics/cssgradientbackgroundmaker/default.html (hyper-link)]
Two things I discovered while struggling with IE 9 gradient.
I had to add height: 100% to my class for IE to use the gradient.
You could use the path of your shape to create a masking layer and apply that on the gradient layer, like this:
If you want to also use the shadows, you would have to place a "duplicate" of the shape layer under the gradient layer, recycling the same path reference.
Bottom line, get the bounds of the path then set the gradient mask's frame using the path bounds and translate as necessary.
Good thing here is that by using the path's bounds rather than any other frame, the gradient will only fit within the path bounds (assuming that's what you want).
But you can make an AppBar like widget which will have a gradient background as follow:
I don't believe you can pass a gradient to an AppBar as it expects a Color rather than a gradient.
You can, however, create your own widget that mimics an AppBar except by using a gradient.
I have used this in past to draw gradient in backgroung
I would recommend looking at this related question: [Using a gradientDrawable with more than three colors set (hyper-link)]
Using the [LinearGradient (hyper-link)] object, you can define a gradient using multiple colors and percentage stops.
The colors in gradients are specified using color stops.
So if we have something like linear-gradient(red 20%, blue 10%, yellow 5%) it will get transformed to linear-gradient(red 20%, blue 20%, yellow 20%).
Per your post, to reproduce the gradient in SVG, define your linear gradient in the svg <defs/> element.
This is described here: [https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/internetweb/conceptual/safarivisualeffectsprogguide/Gradients/Gradient.html (hyper-link)]
This will not work, because of spaces between -webkit-linear-gradient and start bracket.
-webkit-gradient(<type>, <point> [, <radius>]?, <point> [, <radius>]?
Example: -webkit-gradient(linear, left top, left bottom, from(#00abeb), to(#fff), color-stop(0.5, #fff), color-stop(0.5, #66cc00))
You can also use -webkit-linear-gradient(angle, startColor, endColor)
Example: -webkit-linear-gradient(135deg, white, black)
Sources:
[https://webkit.org/blog/175/introducing-css-gradients/ (hyper-link)]
[https://webkit.org/blog/1424/css3-gradients/ (hyper-link)]
Consider a skew transformation on a pseudo element where you apply the gradient.
Since it's a top/bottom direction, the gradient will not get affected by the skewing
For another direction, you may need to adjust the degree of the gradient:
That's because you are already using the linear-gradient property as a trick to create a triangle end on your button.
To better understand, make each gradient with a different color to see the puzzle
In case you aren't restricted to the use of gradient only, You can combine some transformation and gradient:
try placing a div over the image in question and placing the gradient on the div instead of the image.
You may use a container and put the gradient on that container.
Then use a negative z-index to position image behind the gradient.
As commented, you can also use a pseudo element with the gradient and absolute positioning to put the gradient over the image :
To have the gradient fill the viewport, give the <html> element a height of 100%: [fiddle (hyper-link)]
To prevent the gradient from repeating past the visible section of the viewport (assuming there was a scrollbar), replace height: 100%; with min-height: 100%;.
I agree with Adrift, adding height: 100% to the html tag will stretch the gradient.
You should be able to add the rest of the linear gradients for other browsers without any issues.
The linear gradient is repeating itself.
To stretch the gradient over the entire page you have to add this in the css:
I got mine to work by increasing the height of the section which has the gradient background to above 200%.
None of the above answers were 100% satisfying to me, because I wanted a bit more precise control over the gradient and background colors.
If content is < 100% viewport height, gradient scales to fill viewport
If content is >= 100% viewport height, gradient scales with content w/o repeat
So I am setting the other colour to black with a gradient of 30% so the line stays defined.
So you want a radial gradient.
But you are drawing a linear gradient.
Draw a radial gradient if you want a radial gradient!
[https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/graphicsimaging/reference/CGContext/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/c/func/CGContextDrawRadialGradient (hyper-link)]
Another possibility (considerably simpler) is to draw the radial gradient using a CIFilter:
[https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/graphicsimaging/reference/CoreImageFilterReference/Reference/reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/filter/ci/CIRadialGradient (hyper-link)]
When n is low (n < 1000 or n < 10000) you can think of normal equations as the better option for calculation theta, however for greater values Gradient Descent is much more faster, so the only reason is the time :)
I saw a very good answer from [https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/23128/solving-for-regression-parameters-in-closed-form-vs-gradient-descent (hyper-link)]
Other reason is that gradient descent is immediately useful when you generalize linear regression, especially if the problem doesn't have a closed-form solution, like for example in [Lasso (hyper-link)] (which adds regularization term consisting on sum of absolute values of weight vector).
This button has been created entirely with CSS — skew, border and gradient with pseudo elements.
Create the angled shape and gradient with the :before.
The gradient is given an angle to match the direction of the pseudo elements rotation
In order to take more text, the pseudo element with the gradient would need to be larger.
But what I think that line is basically doing is decrementing the gradient vector only on the correct classes, hence making it more negative so when you once you update the weights it will help the classifier predict the right class.
You display the gradient div in the background and whatever content divs you want, separated with an overlaying div whose color matches the background.
Have a look at [Multiple.js (hyper-link)] - which describes how to apply a gradient to multiple elements without js.
Clipping the sum of the gradients has no effect.
You should instead clip each gradient individually.
Here is a quick code snippet for gradient clipping in Tensorflow:
I tested this out, and it works in all modern browsers as you wanted.. however, if you want support across most browsers (including the old), I suggest a CSS3 polyfill.. current support for CSS gradient found [here (hyper-link)].
Try this, using gradient type "sweep":
I think you will need to implement a drawable for the corona with a [RadialGradient (hyper-link)] using the [constructors (hyper-link)] that allows the specification of colors and color stops from the center of the disk.
Mark Allison has a blog post entitled [RadialGradient – Gradients (hyper-link)] that discusses the use of RadialGradients and their implementation.
In DevTools or Firebug, you can display these default values (Firebug: HTML / Style on right, it's in the dropdown) and see that there's a margin of 8px on body thus a body taller than 100% by 16px, the exact value of repeated gradient (in Firefox).
Just add body { margin: 0; } and no more scrollbar or repeated gradient.
I made a gradient image of height 1 (to save space), and sufficient pixels in width to give the proper gradient resolution.
The fact that the rectangle has a gradient in it is a probably a "red herring".
Once you solve that, it should be easy to add the gradient.
The renderer "choked" on the gradient, and didn't render anything else after it encountered it.
decided that the single cell in the outermost grid is much taller than the screen, then two things will happen: the gradient will be stretched very far vertically (so appears not to change), and the buttons will be pushed off the bottom of the screen.
#2 would be a renderer bug involving gradient (but I doubt that will be the case).
Try adding the color attribute and value for the first Gradient stop as well.
To apply the gradient-effect to the icon, you have to target the pseudo-element which contains the icon – see [this jsFiddle (hyper-link)] for a working demonstration based upon your code:
Style each one with its own gradient, using transparent as the underlying color, and the others will show through.
hypothesis - y is the first part of the square loss' gradient (as a vector form for each component), and this is set to the loss variable.
We typically use under_score instead of camelCase in python, so for example the function should be gradient_descent.
If anyone else if having trouble with gradients or getting a certain aspect (angles, transparency, etc.)
I recommend trying this tool to learn more: [http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/ (hyper-link)] The code below is a sample of what it can do.
You can consider clip-path to help you with the white part and then use any kind of gradient:
I've looked at the image using a color picker, the gradient is going from top to bottom, but if you're using a gradient to create the angle, you can't just change gradient direction halfway.
It won't match exactly and won't look as good, but just adding gradient on the middle piece, it will look somewhat close enough.
try using radial-gradient instead of linear-gradient.

Support for full multi-stop gradients with IE9 (using SVG).
Add a "gradient" class to all your elements that have a gradient, 
and add the following override to your HTML to complete the IE9 support:
Additionally, android:angle=270 will rotate gradient from top to the bottom, so it's perpendicular direction to desired.
However this method probably won't work if you want to use colors with transparency in your gradient.
And I add this answer because I found a way to use colors with transparency in gradient.
So, point is shadowColor must be not opaque to use colors with transparency in gradient.
And the alpha of the gradient colors is the paint's alpha if the alpha of the gradient colors are ff(opaque).
(Or the final alpha of text can be scaled again by the gradient color's alpha value provided that the paint's alpha is ff.)
It seems you can't animate css background gradients, but you can still animate opacity to try and get this to work.
If you have two containers, one on top of the other with the exact same width and height, each with a different gradient background colour, you can fade out the container on top to opacity: 0.
I will consider [this previous answer (hyper-link)] to build the rounded gradient using pseudo element so that you can use background-clip:text on the main element.
You can still use vertical gradient for your colored background, but use png-mask for fading.
As I had mentioned in comments, when you add a transparent layer on top of another gradient, it will only show through the colored gradient layer that is below it (and not the image that is present in the container).
So, it would be very tough (almost impossible) to achieve this with gradients.
A way to create this effect with pure CSS is to play with multiple radial gradients, and with the transparency of each
behind the radial gradients, that are quite transparent to allow them to fade in between them, there is a linear gradient that provides opacity (in white) to the right side.
If you want this to be more accurate, you can set more radial gradients, each covering a part of the image.
Another way could be using a png for your gradient in a background with background-size: contain.
you don’t control very well the way the gradient is applied
So this is all on CONTOUR PIXELS but maybe you could so something similar if you compute the orthogonal to the full image pixel gradient... not sure about that ;)

It's not as sexy as a real animated gradient shift, but it's as simple as you can get with CSS only and keyframes, I think.
More details here: [https://dev.to/afif/we-can-finally-animate-css-gradient-kdk (hyper-link)]
The following has the static gradient containing all phases of the animation, which is then moved inside the outer element.
Please note that for the sake of performance the gradient element left unchanged.
Although the question was to animate gradient, moving the background does almost the same thing.
edit  judging from your comment, it seems that you're doing this via CAGradientLayer.
CAGradientLayer is a subclass of CALayer, which has a transform property.
So really you just need to [make a rotational CATransform3D (hyper-link)] and set it as the transform property of your CAGradientLayer.
The default startPoint and endPoint would have the gradient display your colors from top to bottom (which in my mind is a vertical gradient).
If you want the gradient to display from left to right (again in my mind this is a horizontal gradient), use this code on your CAGradientLayer:
such that the gradient is indeed 3.
Similarly for x=10, as f(10) = 119 and f(9)=98, so the gradient is indeed = 21.
The discrepancy between these results and the analytical result is because the gradient is a numerical approximation to the derivative with associated boundary issues.
Consider further what would have happened if you had given less data points, say only two points - the algorithm would give you the gradient as the difference between the points divided by the interval.
The help gradient command doesn't provide enough details of its implementation.

I use [ColorZilla's Gradient Editor (hyper-link)] all the time since it spits out cross browser code and is super easy to use.
This is probably the case because the calculation in done to calculate the gradient is very similar (or the same) to -(1/a)*(1/a) in this case.
You can move the middle of the radial gradient at a different position of the drawable using "centerX" and "centerY" attributes of the gradient.
Example for a 100px long (radius), black-white gradient whose middle starts at upper left corner would be:
UPDATE 3
I changed: colors of gradient, LinearGradient width = 0 and PorterDuffXfermode.

background-repeat: no-repeat, background-attachment: fixed, and position: static will make sure the gradient adjusts to the window size and doesn't bug out.
You did not really specify what you want, but if it is what I think that it is, then it is somewhat similar to what I wrote in [my answer to "How to make gradient border of an image using java?"
The trick here is to not create a single gradient paint, and to not fill a single shape.
Instead, the area that has to be filled with gradients is divided into 8 parts: Four edges and four corners.
The edges are filled with simple gradient paints.
The corners are filled with radial gradient paints.
Now, the purpose of grad method is to calculate gradient of the loss function wrt.
[Sparing (hyper-link)] the details, proper gradient is given by (probs - action) * state in the terminology of your program.
You should be able to wrap your gradient drawable inside a [scale drawable (hyper-link)] with unequal width and height scaling to get the effect of different X and y radii:
Upsampling your line for a better color gradient, as the currently selected answer provides, is still a good idea if you want a smooth gradient and you only have a few points.
You provided net.parameters() with all learnable parameters that will be updated, based on gradients.
It's not as vulnerable to change as the (objectAtIndex:0) methods, so if Apple re-order the children of the webView control it will work fine, but still relies on the fact that the gradient effect is applied by imageviews parented to the scroll view (and that there is indeed a scrollview underpinning the web view).
You just have to remember to set the gradient's frame every time.
It is better to just make the gradient category also set the frame of the view for you.
You apply gradients to it the same way you would apply it to any other view.
anchor is an extension, so this is irrelevant gradient.
You can add starting and end point of gradient color.

I use this custom Button GradientButton
You can make GradientButton instance like this.
If you want a gradient background on a button, rather than adding the gradient as a sublayer and changing its frame in layoutSubviews, I would instead just specify the [layerClass (hyper-link)] of the button to be a CAGradientLayer, so the main layer is a gradient:
By setting the layerClass, it will just make the main layer be a gradient, which automatically is adjusted to the bounds of the button for you.

For example, I can customize the corners, border, and gradient colors and direction in IB:
I've modified [this great answer (hyper-link)] to improve the reusability of the button by adding init parameters for colors, radius, and gradient direction.
I also added updateGradientColors method as it might be useful if you want to change the gradient color at some point.
Generally, browsers do not use dithering when creating gradients.
The only way around this is to make your gradient in software that does dither, such as Photoshop, and then set the background color to be an image.
See also:  [http://bjango.com/articles/gradients/ (hyper-link)]
Both the gradient and image background utilize the same image property of the background.
so basically you are overwriting the image part of the background with the gradient or vice versa depending on which rule takes precedence over the other.
You could use the before pseudo element having the same size as your element for your gradient part.

If you want a real simulation of gradient color you can check [this SO answer (hyper-link)] .It's based on a cross that divided your rectangular view in 4 portions, then shift the colors on each portion to obtain a regular gradient applied to the layer mask.
Also there are some limitations in giving gradient effect in IE because it doesn't supports color-stop and radial gradient.

You have already added the gradient.
To fix the particular problem given in the question, you were actually calculating phi in such a way that meant you doing gradient(phi) was not giving the correct results compared to the symbolic gradient.
Another problem you had was you used gradient incorrectly.
Matlab assumes that [FX,FY]=gradient(phi) means that phi is calculated from phi=f(x,y) where x and y are matrices created using meshgrid.
You effectively had the elements of phi arranged differently to that, an so gradient(phi) gave the wrong answer.
Between reversing the jj and ii, and the incorrect gradient, the errors cancelled out (I suspect you tried doing phi(jj,ii) after trying phi(ii,jj) first and finding it didn't work).
I think this could be causing some confusion with the gradients.
(hyper-link)] Microsoft's gradient filter is binary - only left to right or top to bottom.

Simply place the div with the vertical gradient behind the div with the horizontal gradient (or vice-versa, it doesn't really matter), and make sure the coloring of the topmost gradient is not opaque.
However, as it turns out, applying more than one gradient filter results in only the last one being applied, so simply applying both filters to one layer doesn't work, and two layers are necessary.

sounds to me that your drawRect in the line drawing view is missing the setting of the gradient.
One of the idea I came up is to create a CGPath and stroke it with gradient every time when drawMapRect method been called, since the MKPolylineView is replaced by MKPlolylineRenderer in ios7.
So that is what I'm worked out these days, I almost implemented the basic idea mentioned above but yes, I still cannot pick out an individual PATH according to specific mapRect, so I just draw all paths with gradient at the same time when the boundingBox of all paths intersects with current mapRect.
Then I split the entire path point by point to draw its gradient individually.
last of the last, here you are this is full source of this demo:[https://github.com/wdanxna/GradientPolyline (hyper-link)]
I mapped it to the speed but I guess you can map the gradient to whatever you want.

[https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/RegisterGradient (hyper-link)]
Below, I implemented backpropagated gradient clipping, which can be used with matmul, as shown here, or any other op:
First define your custom gradient:
Since you want nothing to happen in the forward pass, override the gradient of an identity operation with your new gradient:
Here is a working example with a layer that clips gradients in the backwards pass and does nothing in the forwards pass, using the same method:
Since 1.7 there is a new way to redefine the gradient with shorter syntax, which also works with Tensorflow 2.0.
It also allows to redefine the gradient of multiple operations at the same time.
Layer that scales gradients in the backward pass:
Example with a layer that clips gradients in the backward pass:
For current TensorFlow r1.13, use [tf.custom_gradient (hyper-link)].
a function which returns a list of gradients, one for each element in x.
For TensorFlow 2, you should use the tf.custom_gradient decorator as follows:
Note that you must multiply gradient by the upstream gradients.
If you call this as a function when creating a Keras functional model and use tf.GradientTape, then automatic differentiation will still take place, and your custom gradient will be ignored.
You have to do it by changing the percents of the gradient to smaller or larger values, #fff = white so the range should be larger.
The clip rectangle is the area that has changed, not necessarily the entire area of the gradient.
If you want the gradient to start at the top of the (visible area of the) view, and end at the bottom of the (visible area of the) view, then you need to draw the gradient with the same rectangle every time.
The overlay div would contain the gradient background.
I'm not sure what's making yours not work, but I do have a GradientView that I use that can be horizontal or vertical, and works with the ui builder stuff.
You don't want to use locations to specify the direction of the gradient.
The locations array is used when one wants to specify where, in between startPoint and endPoint, the gradient should to take place.
So, for a diagonal gradient from upper left to lower right, you would set startPoint of CGPoint(x: 0, y: 0) and an endPoint to CGPoint(x: 1, y: 1).
If you’re going to add the gradient as a sublayer, you want to update this sublayer’s frame in layoutSubviews so that as the view's bounds changes, so does the frame of the gradientLayer.
But, better than that, override the layerClass of the view, and it will not only instantiate the CAGradientLayer for you, but you also enjoy dynamic adjustments of the gradient as the view’s size changes, notably handling animated changes more gracefully.
Likewise, I set color1 and color2 such that they'll trigger an updating of the gradient, so that any changes in colors will be immediately reflected in the view.
I made this @IBDesignable, so that if I drop this in its own framework, and then add the GradientView in IB, I'll see the effect rendered in IB.
It looks like you forgot to set the startPoint on your CAGradientLayer().
An angled gradient can be achieved using some basic trigonometry.
Given any angle, my code will set the respective start point and end point of a gradient layer.

Therefore, the gradient becomes:

How to generate a smooth color gradient between two colors.
How to render a gradient on an angle.
The intensity of the gradient must be constant in a perceptual color space or it will look unnaturally dark or light at points in the gradient.
You can see this easily in a gradient based on simple interpolation of the sRGB values, particularly the red-green gradient is too dark in the middle.
Using interpolation on linear values rather than gamma-corrected values makes the red-green gradient better, but at the expense of the back-white gradient.
This is true, but we are used to seeing this effect in our natural environment and in a gradient you end up with an overcompensation.
You need an equation to define the line that represents the midpoint of the gradient, and a distance from the line that corresponds to the endpoint colors of the gradient.
The code to generate the gradient needs to change slightly from what's shown above, to be a little more flexible.
Instead of breaking the gradient into a fixed number of steps, it is calculated on a continuum based on the parameter t which ranges between 0.0 and 1.0.
You cannot use border-radius with gradient.
And the same way as mask where you can get the gradient outside of the SVG:

you can use border-image for the border, and just use background-image for the background gradient.
[how to add a pseudo-element gradient effect (hyper-link)]
Here is a way to create the illusion of a gradient border using multiple background gradients:
I assume that gradientDirection is the normalized direction of the first principal axis.
It is done by creating two gradients of different lengths and putting them back-to-back:
I have an Imagemagick bash shell script called, multigradient, which may do what you want.
It allows you to create gradients of many colors each with stops to set where they start.
Example 1: This command creates a red-blue gradient of the finished dimensions, crops it into a top and bottom half, resizes them to 40 and 60 percent of the input height, and appends them back to make a single image.
What started as the color at the exact vertical center is now at 40% down from the top with clean gradients going up and down from there.
That splits the gradient image into a top and bottom half, then inside parentheses it resizes each to the required proportion.
Example 2: This next example starts by creating the red-blue gradient in the final dimensions, then sets variables to hold the top color, the exact middle color, and the bottom color.
It uses "-sparse-color" to fill that with a gradient from "color1" to "color2".
Inside the second parentheses it clones and crops the image to 40% its original height, and using "-sparse-color" again it fills it with a gradient from "color2" to "color3".
After creating those two gradients, delete the original, append the other two together, and write the output.
Some examples using gradients:
This can be achieved using linear-gradient.
Setting multiple colors to the gradient can be done by assigning multiple color stops and the blocky effect can be achieved by making the next color start at the exact same place where the current color ends (that is, same stop percentage for the current color's end position and the next color's start position).
For IE 9 and lower, we would have to use filters like mentioned in [this CSS Tricks article (hyper-link)] because they don't support linear-gradient.
[Can I Use - Linear Gradients (hyper-link)]
If you remove your setting the background size to 200% you see the gradient clears up somewhat.
Also notice setting the angle to 0 gives smooth gradient.
Have a look at my implementation of RadialGradientLayer, and feel free to modify it
Also sometimes I needed different size gradients so thats why you have to pass radius parameter in initializer and the center point of your gradient
Here is an implementation in Swift 3 if you're just looking for a UIView radial gradient background:
That is really the secret to how you control gradients, and get the look you want.
As far as I am aware, you cannot apply gradients to a border directly...
Newer versions of webkit support gradients as a border-image ([http://css-tricks.com/examples/GradientBorder/ (hyper-link)]), but you may have difficulties trying to get that technique working with css shapes like this.
You could perhaps try using CSS Masking to layer a gradient over top of your arrow shape, though my experience with these techniques is too limited to confirm wether this would work or not.
You could also go to border images, but right now the support is also weak for gradient images.
You should be able to create a reference to the gradient layer...
res/drawable/gradient_shape.xml:
Make sure that the View below gradient is actually below and not just touching Gradient shape View.
If you have main    RelativeLayout, ListView   and    View(Background:Gradient )
make sure that Gradient View is on top, of the ListView, and not a side.
If Your gradient is aside it will be transparent by RelativeLayout Background Color and not by ListView .
You can save the mask gradient when you use a CGBlendMode.
Apply radial transparent gradient:
I had the same problem and solved it by creating a gradient custom view which I then convert to an image and assign it as the progress view track image.
This has the visual effect of revealing the gradient image underneath.
With that in mind, the laziest way to do this would be to create your gradient image and set it as the progressImage
Now that we've got a way to create a gradient image "on the fly", here's how to use it:
Add android:alpha=0.8 (or whatever float value you want) along with android:background="@drawable/background_gradient_blue_indigo" to the FrameLayout.
Save the Gradient as an XML in your drawable.
A  workaround could be to use a gradient that fades from transparent to a color.
Put that on top of a non-gradient element upon which you actually can perform a color animation.
Update: Use context.drawLinearGradient() instead of CAGradientLayer in a [manner similar to the following (hyper-link)].
It will draw gradients that are consistent with Sketch/Photoshop.
If you absolutely must use CAGradientLayer, then here is the math you'll need to use...
It took some time to figure out, but from careful observation, I found out that Apple's implementation of gradients in CAGradientLayer is pretty odd:
Then it applies the gradient using start/end points.
The middle gradient will indeed form a 90 degree angle in this resolution.
This means that the middle gradient will no longer form a 90 degree angle in the new size.
I tried this with a view size=320x60, gradient=[red@0,green@0.5,blue@1], startPoint = (0,1), and endPoint = (1,0).
I can't tell if that's because I'm calculating the start/end points incorrectly, or if it's just a difference in how Apple blends gradients vs. how Sketch blends gradients.
You could make use of multiple backgrounds and  stack them like in the below snippet where the first background is your linear-gradient and the second one is a solid color (which is same as the linear gradient's end color).
By not repeating the gradient (using the no-repeat), we can limit the gradient to be present only for the screen's height whereas the solid color background would by default run through the full size.
Note: I have added a red end color to the linear-gradient just to show how the solid color takes over from the point where the gradient ends.
If you want that effect, you need two layers, back layer with the final color and the top layer with the gradient.
I use the html with a gold color and the body with the gradient, simply means, the parent the main color and the children the gradient with the full viewport height.
Then, create your gradient descent method (Jgrad is automatically updated in each loop iteration):
You can also take a look at [fminunc, built in Matlab's method for function optimization (hyper-link)] which includes an implementation of gradient descent, among other minimization techniques.
The new scenario you describe (performing Backpropagation on each randomly picked sample), is one common "flavor" of Stochastic Gradient Descent, as described here: [https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-difference-between-gradient-descent-and-stochastic-gradient-descent (hyper-link)]
Initially, updates were made in what you (correctly) call (Batch) Gradient Descent.
With the growth of datasets size, and complexier computations in each step, Stochastic Gradient Descent came to be preferred in these cases.
As such, in many situations it is preferred to use Mini-batch Gradient Descent, combining the best of both worlds: each update to the weights is done using a small batch of the data.
This way, the direction of the updates is somewhat rectified in comparison with the stochastic updates, but is updated much more regularly than in the case of the (original) Gradient Descent.
[UPDATE] As requested, I present below the pseudocode for batch gradient descent in binary classification:
For stochastic gradient descent, the call to neural_network.backpropagate_and_update() is called inside the for cycle, with the sample error as argument.
You can achieve what you want like this: Place your background at 0px 0px and define a gradient with more color-stops, having one solid color area at the top and then the actual gradient, like this:
when implementing ShapeDrawable.ShaderFactory return the LinearGradient using colors array with 4 colors (f.ex: white, dark_blue, dark_blue, white) and positions array with 4 positions (f.ex: 0, 0.2, 0.8, 1)
The reason [dx,dy,~]=gradient(rand(5,5,3),1:5,1:5,1:3) works is because the first two inputs are both of length 5.
While I've never done this before (so I don't know what's involved) you could implement a type that inherits from [GradientBrush (hyper-link)].
I've also not worked with Photoshop circular gradients, but from your description I can't help but think that you could at least approximate it using a [LinearGradientBrush (hyper-link)] and then transforming the result - perhaps using a [MatrixTransform (hyper-link)].
You could mimic the HSV gradient by adding extra colors to the gradient.

In general, a colour gradient is a linear function for easing from one colour to another.
For instance, if you wanted to produce a gradient from red (100%, 0%, 0%) to blue (0%, 0%, 100%), you would sweep each colour value from its initial value to its target value.
At the middle of the gradient, the colour value would be equal to 50% of the first colour, added to 50% of the second colour.
You need to specify a clipping path right before drawing the gradient.
The gradient will be clipped to the rectangle.
Just specify plain colors instead of gradients.
The JFreeChart version 1.0.13 default is to use GradientBarPainter which adds a metallic-ish look to the bar.

If you check the HSL values pixel per pixel, you'll see that the color isn't actually getting darker, and the gradient works as expected.

I think there may be a typo in the Bootstrap v2.2.2 docs for some of the gradient mixins.
If you check the mixins.less file it looks like you don't need the leading dot when calling the gradient mixin, ie
    #gradient > .vertical(#999, #fff);
On an html page I have a div with ID=gradient-test
The idea is the same in Bootstrap 3 (as David Taiaroa suggested) and in addition there are two additional parameters that you can pass in to control how the gradient looks:
Gradients are [image values (hyper-link)], so setting background-color alone won't affect your gradient.
The trick is to use two linear-gradients for the background of the container of the image, one horizontal and one vertical, that are transparent in the middle and fully white at the edges.
I use this tool to generate css gradients, it's fantastic and very useful:
[http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/#252525+19,f5f5f5+20,f5f5f5+39,00b7b7+40,00b7b7+59,b70000+60,b70000+79,fcd50e+80,fcd50e+100 (hyper-link)]
The standard linear-gradient syntax allows for color hinting (cutting down on the verbosity of this background style), but not all browsers appear to support it.
What about multiple gradient like this:
I don't know a core graphics solution for the gradient but if you can make an image in photoshop which starts white on the right and fades to alpha on the left you could overlay that on top of the content image
You can use QuartzCore to apply a mask (with gradient transparency) to the UIImageView:
I needed only 20% of bottom image to be transparent with gradient.
JQuery Gradient Plugin:

Here is a third, more up to date, jQuery gradient plugin
JQuery Gradient Picker
[https://github.com/tantaman/jquery-gradient-picker (hyper-link)]
Not exactly a background gradient plug-in, but  textgrad may help when horizontal gradients need to be applied to text
[This (hyper-link)] is the best CSS gradient tool/generator in my opinion
EDIT
This supports radial and diagonal linear gradients
Fill the path with a linear gradient (Fill and Stroke dialog > Fill > Linear gradient) and choose any colours you like.
Adjusting this line may help you to fine tune the gradient (however, strictly speaking it will not follow the path but a rectangle defined by the start and end marker of the marked line)
I have declared a variable so that GradientImage can be generated only once, but its up to your implementation to use it the way you want
In ViewDidLoad I initialize the gradientImage and UISegmentedControl as
Finally updateGradientBackground function definition is same as the one I posted in my original answer
Implemented gradient color for knob on iOS13+ UISegmentControl.
Added subview with gradient then set mask to it and copying animations to match original knob.
However, it appears to work just fine on my system; just be aware it might not be a good way to apply a gradient to many nodes in the same view.
Make use of Angle attribute to achieve gradient in wanted direction.
as another attribute in your gradient
Not sure what you had in mind with these "lots of little linear gradients", but you actually just need a single one, the size of your circle's circumference, and only to get the correct colors to use.
What you'll need a lot though are lines, since we'll draw these around the center point using the solid colors we had in the linearGradient.
So to render this, you just move to the center point, then draw a line using a solid color from the linear gradient, then rotate and repeat.
To get all the colors of a linearGradient, you just need to draw it and map it's ImageData to CSS colors.
The hard part though is that to be able to have an object that behaves like a CanvasGradient, we need to be able to set it as a fillStyle or strokeStyle.
An other difficulty is that gradients are virtually infinitely big.
But beware, all this is quite computationally heavy, so be sure to use it sporadically and to cache your resulting Gradients/Patterns.
I m sorry , i forgot to scroll the gradient java-script in my new layout.
It looks like the percentages inside the linear-gradient are expected to add up to 100%.
Given that your proportions are 66%/33% in your first example, your second example should be using linear-gradient(90deg, transparent 66.6667%, #444 33.3333%).
So make sure that your browser supports gradients
It seemed I also had a gradient on the background.
It seems having both this gradient and a button gradient means the button loses.
I've noticed setting a gradient on the body if it has a margin of 0 doesn't work.
To summarize the findings from earlier, it appears that removing the gradientUnits="userSpaceOnUse" attribute and value pair from the <radialGradient> tag allows for the radial gradient to become (or at least appear to become) elliptical in shape.
Also, adding stop-opacity attributes and values to each <stop> tag allows for the elliptical gradient effect to be more easily seen (at least for demonstration purposes.)
see: [elliptical radialGradient (hyper-link)] vs [circular radialGradient (hyper-link)]
There is also a [tutorial online (hyper-link)] that appears to provide similar behavior for a similar elliptical gradient approach and the results from that tutorial can be found in this [jsFiddle (hyper-link)].
Note: If this approach does not work for your purposes, there may be some other, better approach (possibly having to do with [gradient (hyper-link)] [transformations (hyper-link)], or something similar...)
Here is the red_gradient.xml file:
There are no other cross-browser issues with the old and new radial gradient syntaxes that I am aware of.
ofcourse result looks different because you use this 
background: radial-gradient(circle at 50% 50% , #00f 0%, #fff 100%);
there is a jQuery plugin used to work with gradient.

Gradientz looks even more complete and easy to use.
I have tried your jsfiddle gradient in Firefox and Edge, and it seems that there is no problem with your colors, so maybe there is a Chrome bug, or something.
Vanishing gradients was the issue.

But i've always just used a 1px wide slice of the gradient.
I got it to work by creating the gradient with js and attributing it to my path.
Simply set the [pointer-events property (hyper-link)] of your .gradient element to none, like so:
However, you could achieve the same result with a little less markup by using a [pseudo-element (hyper-link)] to create your gradient:
Frame class has background gradient colour and a 10px border light pink.
[https://css-tricks.com/gradient-borders-in-css/ (hyper-link)]
None of them are responsible for gradient, so you can just remove this line from your code.
I'm not sure if I understand your question, but if you need the positions where the gradient is zero, you can write something like this:
When you need to set gradients on text css is not the tool to use.
Its easier to use svg for advanced gradient and all complex shapes.
Define two gradient one for the background one for the text.
([LinearGradient (hyper-link)])
Set the stroke and fill of the elements to the LinearGradients.
When blending the colors in the gradient, your blending all aspects of the color:  RBGA
You see, until you reach the full second color, you are mixing black into the color gradient and that mix won't be at the full transparency.
If you blend from white to white (transparent), you'll have the same problem as before only with white (which will be less noticeable since it's one of the colors you're using):  The gradient will have a white "streak" until the second color reaches full transparency.
I have got fatamorgana, I'm sure that GradientPaint is darker and darker and darker, phaaa crazy eye illusion, brrrr
So gradient has zero frame!
SVG does not allow for these kind of gradients.
You should set your gradient in the secondary progress and solid color in progress.
I think that currently transitioning from a background gradient to another background gradient is impossible.
I have seen some people circumvent this by using a large gradient background-image or a background gradient and then transitioning using the background-position property.
Example here:
[http://sapphion.com/2011/10/css3-gradient-transition-with-background-position/ (hyper-link)]
Instead of using background gradient you can use two large DIVwith two different gradient placed behind everything, one on top of the other.
Not a fix to the problem, just a workaround… you can use multiple gradients as multiple backgrounds of a small enough size as to not trigger the problem (< ~300px seems to do it).
We must place the gradient of the first color from 0% to 51%.
And the gradient of the next color from 50% to 100%.
To prevent the blurriness issue, all linear gradients in the example above define only 7 explicit gradient end-stops.
(Note that the first linear gradient defines an 8th gradient stop, but not an explicit end-stop but just the start stop, as it isn't necessary to explicitly define the start-stop at the beginning or the end-stop at the end of the gradient (0% is automatically used as start-stop and 100% as end-stop), hence the blurriness bug isn't triggered.)
The gradients above must use a transparent part to make the gradients below visible and still sharply end the gradient for the block-like visual.

Create one Imagick instance with gradient, second one with text and alpha channel background, and combine them into the one.
Indicating a gradient of 1 as you would expect.
If I understand correctly if the object gets filled by a gradient then you can never change it to a regular color.
If so then just have the other colors be a gradient but have color1 and color2 be the same value.
In CoronaSDK setFillColor() with a gradient structure is done like this:
The [docs (hyper-link)] say that you can specify the gradientRadius attribute as a float (guessing that it would mean px) or as fraction.
Use percentages, in the android:gradientRadius field.
Since we cannot apply this directly to the radial gradient XML drawable, we have to apply in from code:
This overrides the android:gradientRadius field, so you can leave that to 0.
I apply this to the background of my view (to which the gradient drawable is already set!)
I would recommend applying the gradient to another UIView that sits behind the TableView.
Here's an example, but it could be improved by adjusting some of the % numbers in the linear-gradients, and by having smother gradient shapes (currently triangles with cut-off tops).
I made it using CSS gradient generator:

Plot stacked segments to simulate a gradient.
You can't achieve that using simple gradients, but you can use basic composition, with an horizontal QLinearGradient for the color, and a vertical for the black component.
You need to give gradient a matrix that describes your angular frequency values for your (x,y) points.
Here is how to interpret your gradient:
and the gradients
And what are our gradient components at that point?
You'll notice they aren't exactly correct, that is because my Z data isn't continuous, there is a step size of 0.05 and gradient can only approximate the rate of change.

You can use a sweep gradient for this!
A sweep gradient looks [a bit like a cone (hyper-link)], but by offsetting it waaaaay to the left (via centerX), you can achieve the effect with a single gradient.
You can remove border and apply gradient to :after background
You can use as a background, you can change color of gradient as you need.
A possible way to solve your problem : using :before and :after to draw a "box footer" using skew to make a triangle, so that you have a responsive and accurate background gradient.
First of all note that -webkit-gradient was intended by Apple and implemented in 2008 in Webkit based web browsers (for instance Safari 4) which has a pretty different syntax than the W3C standard:
A year later Mozilla introduced -moz-linear-gradient (since Firefox 3.6) which has also a different syntax than the old Webkit version but then it implemented in Webkit under -webkit-linear-gradient:
However the W3C standard version of linear-gradient is quiet different, the formal syntax of [linear-gradient() (hyper-link)] expression is:
An alternative to this, is to add a third gradient onto your header to have a smoother transition onto the body's linear gradient.
For example: background:linear-gradient(#fff, #000, #232323); for your header.
The settings in the [linear gradient (hyper-link)] doesn't specify where the gradient starts, but the destination of the gradient.
The degree means your gradient color goes along the 225 deg.

So to create the above gradient (except with different colors) programatically:
Note: The orientation is ignored for a radial gradient but is needed for the constructor that takes colors.
This will set the appropriate gradient.
How do you implement a custom gradient on a UINavigationBar?

Looking for a similar solution I just came across this brand new tutorial, which lets you bridge a Swift gradient background ([https://github.com/soffes/GradientView (hyper-link)]) library while walking through every step to get a working React component.
It is a step-by-step tutorial, allowing you to build your own component by bridging the swift and objective-c component into a usable React Native component, which overrides the standard View component and allows you to define a gradient like the following:
Here is a good choice for gradients for both platforms iOS and Android:

npm install react-native-linear-gradient --save
use import LinearGradient from 'react-native-linear-gradient'; in your application file
Just export your gradient as SVG and use it using react-native-svg and when after you import your component set width and height and preserveAspectRatio="xMinYMin slice"to scale an SVG gradient at your needs.
If you want to avoid the grey in the middle you can use a gradient from transparent white (255, 255, 255, 0) to opaque white (255, 255, 255, 1),#fff.
In your code the gradient goes from transparent black to opaque white and because of that the grey part in the middle shows up in FF.
I guess chrome and other browser calculate the color steps in the gradient differently.
The first background-size is the one of the gradient, and the second one (30 px) is the size of the repeating pattern.
This would mean that you have more control over the gradient, as well as it being slightly less dependent on CSS support.
For exemple, if you have 3 icons, i'd take 2 colors for each icons and then set a specific gradient for each one of them.
Another solution would be to set a general background gradient, the set the icon transparents and cover it back with a white background except over the icons.
You can use -webkit-background-clip and position a fixed-size gradient on each icon individually, but it currently browser support for this is limited to Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
You need to add some opacity to the gradient, it solved it for me, here a fiddle for you:
Vendor-specific selectors such as -moz-linear-gradient are not part of the official CSS2 specification, so when the validator finds then, it will throw an error.
Personally, I don't mind if stuff like this doesn't validate - it's only a nice, cleanly written gradient.
I think your gradient layer add on your shadow view show your shadow view disappear..You should always add gradient layer at 0 index of layers.

You need to define the gradients with background-image and the plain color with background-color:
A posibility is to set a gradient that has 2 parts, one with the color changing, and the other with a constant color.
And change the part of the gradient that you are showing with background-image.position

Are you asking about linear gradient?
While googling it, I found 2 ways to do it for android: [use ShaderFactory (hyper-link)] or extends View, using new Shader(new LinearGradient()).
Its really expensive if number of such animated gradients more than ~3.
I avoided calling new every onDraw(), using single precalculated LinearGradient.
The trick is to create LinearGradient which is colorsCount times larger than View.getWidth().
After that you can use canvas.translate(), while drawing gradient, to change its color, so no new calls in onDraw() at all.
To create gradient, you need current width and height.
So the last what you need to do is to animate gradientOffset.
Simply use setColors (int[] colors) method of GradientDrawable and animate it over time.
where the view is a simple View with gradient background:
This is how it would work but neither the image or the gradient have any transparency so in the example they will cover each other up in every which order you place them :
I've reversed the placement here otherwise the gradient wouldn't be visible at all.
You can create gradients in XML
This example is a round gradient but by changing type param you can create others.
[http://www.dibbus.com/2011/06/android-gradient-toolbar/ (hyper-link)]
You can find some examples of gradients and what is possible using xml and/or 9-pacth images.
One approach is to spread out your gradient a bit more.
Adding a 2% gradient transition to either side of the stripe gives a slight blur that obscures the jaggies without eliminating the edge.
This means the gradient must be zero almost everywhere.
While the code doesn't say anything about it, I expect that the gradient is set to a constant zero everywhere.
Use linear-gradient in CSS:
linear-gradient(to (top, right, bottom, left), (color begin), (color finish));
Using shapes you can draw three kinds of gradient: the usual one-way gradient color, radial gradient (which is a circle of gradienting color) and sweep gradient.
I am not aware of any other way of providing gradient coloring in android.
Gradient is created through blending of colors.

GIMP can't parse that directly, althoug GIMP 2.8 ships with a Python script that can output gradients in this CSS syntax
You could make a python-script to parse CSS gradient syntax into GIMP Gradients, 
and them use this gradient on an image.
Of course it is overkill if you are needing that just once - 
I'd recommend creating a new gradient in GIMP, and manually edit the recorded file
(in ~/.gimp-2.8/gradients folder if you are on *nix, else check for the user gradients folder in the preferences).
GIMP's gradient file is straightforward  - a text only file that goes like:
So this is a single gradient, with two segments - each line has the start-point, endpoint of each segment, the starting ARGB color, ending ARGB color, and ,...don't care, just keep the four zeros at the end: most likely they are used to describe the type of color in each endpoint, and we want 0.
Fill the top square half with a gradient of color A to color B, and the bottom square with a gradient from color A to color C. 
Then you set it as your background image with "repeat" property enabled.
CSS3 gradients can be considered as functions that generate a fixed-sized image, so they still need to be controlled with the size property.
In IE9 there was some margin around the edge of the gradient.
You want to apply a gradient towards the top-left and another towards the bottom right.
You can however do this with a single gradient using 3 colors.
PS: I did only use the "regular" gradient and not all cross-browser ones (you seem to be perfectly capable of that yourself).
PSII: You can always add more colors to the gradient.
But anyway, a quick look at [the documentation for numpy.gradient (hyper-link)] reveals:
The gradient is computed using central differences in the interior and first differences at the boundaries.
Instead of using your gradient as a background of the main container of the layout, add a child View, set the height explicitly to the size you want (230dp), and set the background of that view to your gradient.
grey_gradient_bg is now simple:
If your project doesn't require API < 21 you may set the size of your gradient directly in your drawable, like that:
Setting height in gradient tag or size really doesn't work.
Add the linear-gradient as the background of the table.
Note: I have used a red to blue gradient in the answer to make the effect more apparent to the eye.
Gradients do not appear to be supported at this time, nor do CID image paths.
For all browsers except IE you can solve this by using pointer-events: none, but otherwise the safest way is to make your gradient a fixed height and your :before element the height of the gradient you want, resulting in a (in this case) 20px area that would not take your mouse events at the bottom.
You need to start your gradient at the top, because it's darker at the top.

Not yet, the two examples you provided are the only coded gradients available as yet, as far as I know.
It's good thing no browser has yet "standardized" on a linear-gradient syntax yet, since it changed between February 2011 and January 2012:
‘linear-gradient()’ syntax
4.1.1. linear-gradient() syntax
No, there is no standard way to specifying gradients.
You could change the way you set up the stops in the gradient, I think it would make more sense to instead of shifting the gradient using the stops, shift the start point, i.e instead of starting from the top edge, start from the vertical center, something like this
Alternatively, look at passing kCGGradientDrawsBeforeStartLocation as an option to CGContextDrawLinearGradient, as that could also make a difference.

There is an easier way of getting a gradient as a UIImage.
You can use a CAGradientLayer.
To apply the gradient to text you next need to use the image returned as the textColor using UIColor(patternImage: ...).
Based on the code in your own answer, it looks like you need a line which is a gradient in itself (from blue to green) and also have dashed pattern.
This is not possible to achieve with one gradient image because spaces cannot be introduced in the middle of a gradient.
The second gradient in the above snippet is the same as the one in your answer (except the usage of the latest standard cross-browser syntax).
The first gradient is the replacement for your hr and it is nothing but a repeating gradient which is transparent for 50% of image's width and the color you need for the other 50%.
The background-size of the first gradient image is set as 16px 2px where 16px is the width and 2px is the height.
[http://gradients.glrzad.com/ (hyper-link)]
You will find the syntax for gradients there.
…while #444444 is the color at top of the gradient and #999999 the gradient-color at the bottom.
The different "vendor-prefixes" ensure that the gradient works in different browsers as the 'default'-syntax is not supported by every browser by now.
The filter-property will make the gradient work in Internet Explorer 8 and below.
Edit: The syntax for linear-gradient changed.
[CSS3 Gradients (hyper-link)]
CSS gradients are cool stuff.
When you are used background gradients in ie9.
With this tool you create a gradient: [http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/ (hyper-link)]
And with this tool you create a SVG for ie9: [http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/graphics/svggradientbackgroundmaker/default.html (hyper-link)]
When you put "body" in front, it's acting like each line of text is where the gradient will start.
Change "body" in your css to ".this" and then put that in a div class, you'll see the gradient.
You need to use 2 of 'something' as gradients can only be drawn in a single direction at a time.
You could do it with 2 CAGradientLayers, one behind the other (or one as a sublayer of the other).
Or, you could do it with 2 CGGradients, both drawn into the same context.
You make the bottom layer a linear-gradient then you consider another one above it with a pseudo element for the conic gradient.
If the last one will fall you will only see the linear-gradient.
If not it will cover the linear-gradient.
The below code will show a conic gradient on Chrome and linear gradient on Firefox:
You can solve this by creating two layers:
First you create a layer which you fill with the gradient.
Yes you can do it using a gradient image, just overlay the image on the text

Combine the two (best with modernizr.com) and you might have what you wanted (depends on how complicated the gradient is)
From Firefox 36 onwards gradients will use premultiplied colours which will make transforming to/from transparent work the way you expect it to.
[The syntax for a gradient is (hyper-link)]:
And linear-gradient doesn't create a color, it creates an image.
Gradients inside of a gradient is not possible.
Since the gradients are layered on you would have to set some transparency to your colors with rgba() to allow the gradient from behind to show through the gradient from above.
A more flexible alternative would be to add transform: translateY(-100%) to your .bottom-gradient.
Changed the rotation of the gradients to 1deg and -1deg.
You can optimize your code using only pseudo elements and by defining the gradient once.
I also suspect you want to have something responsive which means that the distance between both gradients should not change when your resize the window (which is not the case for the above solutions).
For example, I used the next code to make the gradient in the image.

You cannot do this with gradient but you can use rotation like below:
[Set gradient color for text in Android Studio with Kotlin language (hyper-link)]
Also, tf.multiply has two inputs, so its gradients should have two outputs.
p represents the percentage form where the gradient will start.
after creating the gradient you have to assign it to an rectangle by using:
It's not possible to have transitions on background gradients.
You can also make it appear like it's changing by using the background-position shift: [http://sapphion.com/2011/10/css3-gradient-transition-with-background-position/ (hyper-link)]
Here is a similar question with more links and information btw: [Use CSS3 transitions with gradient backgrounds (hyper-link)]
"Gradients don't support transitions yet (although the spec says they
  should).
If you want a fade-in effect with a background gradient, you
  have to set an opacity on the container and transition the opacity."
Source: [Use CSS3 transitions with gradient backgrounds (hyper-link)]
This page has an example of changing the background colour, obviously you'd need to add the gradient.
I've wrote a jQuery Plugin for animating Css3 Gradients for browsers that support it.
It uses a Gradient cssHook I wrote for normalising CSS3 gradients to make it easier to use.
It needs a gradient to be set first for this to work.
It's linearGradient with a capital G
I had a very strange bug in chrome when this gradient didn't work
until I've changed the ids from paint0_linear and paint1_linear to gradient1 and gradient2.
Assuming I'm understanding what you want correctly, you could duplicate the top 300ish pixels of your image and apply a transparency gradient to them in Photoshop (making the top completely opaque and the bottom completely transparent).
(The new standardised way of doing it is would use mask-image and linear-gradient using its new syntax.
See caniuse.com for [mask-image (hyper-link)] and [linear-gradient (hyper-link)].)
Here's how you can do it using modern mask-image and linear-gradient properties.
(See caniuse.com for [CSS masks (hyper-link)] and [linear-gradient (hyper-link)].)
In this code snippet, I've given the html element an orange and yellow gradient background, to prove that this method is using real transparency and uses the element underneath it as background.
Go to this link [http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/ (hyper-link)] You can add colours like you would in Photoshop and it will create a gradient code for you as well as gracefully degrades when moving to older versions of browsers.
A simple linear gradient, from top to bottom (#6e6e6e to #313131), for the body tag:
You can find more information and examples about gradients in CSS3 [here (hyper-link)].
You can just toggle to right and to left in linear gradient.
[CSS3 Gradients (hyper-link)]
WebKit paved the way for gradients in CSS by adding support for -webkit-gradient back in early 2008, and they’ve become widely used since their introduction.
Over the past several months, the CSS Working Group has had extended discussions about making the gradient syntax easier to use, and recently Tab Atkins included a proposal in the latest draft of the Image Values and Replaced Content module.
The main goal of the new syntax is simplicity; it’s now really easy to code up common gradients, as you’ll see in the examples below.
Here are some simple examples (note that all these examples are resizable, so you can see how resizing the box affects the gradients):
Add extension of UIImage and just pass colours list to apply gradient.
try to generate css gradient  from this site, and see if any difference you can found, it will help you to debug your code,

I wanted the whole page to have a gradient background, and this issue was quite annoying.
Gradient was generated at [ColorZilla site (hyper-link)].
In this case you can't use border solution for the ":after", instead create another gradient and rotate the element.
Thats why i might recommend the canvas option in html5 to draw the text with the gradient.
[https://www.inkling.com/read/html5-canvas-fulton-fulton-1st/chapter-3/text-with-gradients-and-patterns (hyper-link)]
Did you try code from [gradient generator (hyper-link)]?
As I can see in your code, -ms-linear-gradient(......., 1).
You need to understand that 
    linear-gradient() function uses top-down, left-right, right-left or bottom-up
    approaches.
But the problem is you are
    using 100% opacity with edge and you cannot get the gradient correctly.
Try to optimize your linear function with something like this: 
    -ms-linear-gradient(......., 0.5) or -ms-linear-gradient(......., 0.45) which is 
    literally translated as 50% or 45% alpha linear.
You can just make an object with a gradient fill, then put your text on a new layer and set that layer as a mask for the gradient object.
It is a simple gradient method you're using, but if that's fine for your use there is nothing wrong with that.
The corner cases are a problem because you don't have enough data to calculate a gradient in the same way as the other pixels.
If you assume that the gradient changes smoothly it works like this:
In your x-gradient calculations you may have calculated the derivate A for pixel 1 and B for pixel 2.
Done by copy-past code from TTLinearGradientFillStyle.
Several lines changed for achieve horizontal gradient.
The cmap gradient seems to apply vertically.
Is there a way to apply the gradient horizontally?
to use cairo_mask() instead of cairo_paint() to draw the gradient.
The above answer is useful but in graphs, it is difficult to distinguish between darker gradients of black.
One alternative I found is to use gradients of gray colors as follows
When I used the code above for different colours like blue and black, the gradients were not that clear.
As explained [here (hyper-link)], it allows for a variety of color gradients that are based on more than two colors.
The package is pretty easy to use - you just need to replace the ggplot2 scale fill function (e.g., scale_fill_gradient(low = "skyblue", high = "dodgerblue4")) with the equivalent viridis function.
You could however use floodfill to set the color to something not already in the image, then loop over the pixels, check for that color of the pixel, and do a gradient fill that way.
You can make Shapes (Pathes) and gradient-fill them with GDI+.
I have created a demo for you, you can do this with the help of CAGradientLayer see the following output and code for this.
For gradient button text color and border put your UIButton inside UIView, then assign CAGradientLayer to UIview.
You just need to add below UIView extension and call the function to get desire gradient button,
Consider using this tool: [http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/ (hyper-link)]
I found a way in [Gradient v.2.71 (hyper-link)]
setgradient make a gradient going through the points you define.
You can improve the result by adding more points in the way of the gradient as:
if you don't want to update you can simple use it without gradient direction.
background-image: linear-gradient(#659adc, #004ca2)
Your image is above the gradient.
Also, the gradient of the loss with respect to the weights is:
So just as we did with the SVM loss function the gradients are as follows:
[image]
Make a gradient background, but use rgba colors.
Above is a blue to transparent gradient.
For the method spreadMethod ="repeat" to start working in your example, you need to reduce the gradient coverage by three times.
If the colors I'd like to have the gradient on to be manually selected here's what I suggest:
I think, I found the solution by imitating angular gradient with linear.
Angular gradients are created when x1 and x2 differ and y1 and y2 differ.
Just include the solid color property before the gradient.
Browsers that don't understand the gradient will ignore it and use the previous property:
You can simply set border-image to your gradient.
[https://css-tricks.com/examples/GradientBorder/ (hyper-link)]
Change your view background from android:background="@drawable/shadow" to android:background="@drawable/gradient" as you mentioned as gradient.xml
Use following code to apply gradient for a view or layout.
gradient_transparent.xml(res/drawable) :
This is a bug with Chrome's implementation of gradients, it happens with CSS gradients too.
Fortunately in your case there's a workaround: use spreadMethod: reflect; which will allow you to state the gradient in a smaller area and just let the browser repeat it:
It isn't possible to do it with percentages, but you can achieve the outcome using overlapping gradients.
You're layering multiple transparent -> colour -> transparent gradients over each other with vertical offsets.
Unfortunately, CAGradientLayer doesn't support radial gradients.
you can't init radial CAGradientLayer, BUT you can easily modify current layer style to radial
By 2019, the accepted answer is erroneous and you can make a radial gradient by setting its type property to .radial.
string $direction
  The shape or direction of the gradient, which can be any of : vertical, horizontal, ellipse, ellipse2, circle, circle2, rectangle, diamond.
To make them from scratch, well the easiest way is look at the source code of that script: [http://planetozh.com/download/gd-gradient-fill.php (hyper-link)] from there you should be able to rummage through it and get  the proper commands for it.
For a Linear Gradient you would simply do >
Create the Header component which is wrapped in the Linear Gradient.
by making the header backgroundColor: 'transparent' you will then show the Linear Gradient wrapping it.
Return the screen with the header being your GradientHeader component.
[Gradient Header (hyper-link)]
and the GradientHeader:
You can have a gradient header just doing this :
You can use LinearGradient component from the expo.
It is a useful component and you can't install another library like react-native-linear-gradient.
[https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/linear-gradient/ (hyper-link)].
If the substraction less than zero the loss is zero so the gradient of W is also zero.
If the substarction larger than zero, then the gradient of W is the partial derviation of the loss.
The method to calculate gradient in this case is Calculus (analytically, NOT numerically!).
Your background-image covers the whole container (background-size: cover;), so the gradient won't become visible.
Set the gradient on the div
If your code goes through that set of if statements without hitting anything (since == may not give you a match) then you have an uninitialized CGGradientRef, which you later on attempt to draw and release.
ChartJS will not (properly) use gradient fill colors when drawing a linear gradient on non-linear paths like your donut chart.
A linear gradient does not curve.
Possibility #1 -- use a radial gradient
You might experiment with a radial gradient and see if the results meets your design needs.
Possibility #2 -- use a gradient stroke (a DIY project)
If you want to "roll-your-own" gradient donut chart, here's example code and a Demo that uses a gradient strokeStyle on a circular path (see my previous answer here: [Angle gradient in canvas (hyper-link)]):
Step 2 - Declare a const gradient and assign it.
Step 3 - Push the colors that you wan to see as Gradient.
You can create an shape and inside of that you can set a gradient with start, center and end color, like this:
then you'll have a tricolored gradient.

If you are looking for cross browser CSS3 Radial Gradient:
From my point of view, the best tool on CSS gradient is [Ultimate CSS Gradient Generator (hyper-link)].
The css I use to create a linear gradient is as follows.
Seems the only difference to yours is I set a gradientType to 1 (horizontal), not 0 (vertical), and I use distinct colours.
The other issue is that you are using close to white colours, so the gradient effect isnt that noticeable.
Try changing to a more distinct starting colour such as #ff000 to see if the gradient is actually working first.
In the above code, we loaded the gradient image in GradientItemDecoration and we update its bounds in onDraw as the user interacts with the RecyclerView.
How to create Gradient ?
Create Gradient is very easy
Inside shape tag create gradient tag
Gradient Properties........
if you need gradient in
Or you could simply use Gradient Generator tools at [AngryTools (hyper-link)], which is much easier and fun to use.
The forcing of color to black shows the gradient is working though, looks like the color shift may not be enough.
I don't think ggplot was intended for such use, but here's one way to simulate a transparency gradient.
Move the video out of the gradient div, now position the gradient over the video with position: absolute and because you have z-index: 10; it should cover the video properly.
One issue with this solution that you will most likely run into if you actually give the .gradient  fixed height & width it will cover the video controls and they won't be clickable.
You must set width and height to the div containing the gradient in order to be displayed.
Notice that i've pulled the video element out of the gradient div, so it can be displayed on top of it.
Stochastic Gradient Descent is generally juxtaposed with Batch Gradient Descent.
Gradients in styled-components are the same as in regular CSS, but your gradient syntax seems to be invalid – for example the cover keyword [was only in early browser implementations (hyper-link)] many years ago.
