How to install it and also how to use it
on
Your machine my name is ahmad khareshi i
am
Seasoned ai professional with more than
Two decades of experience in the area
I have worked both in the industry and
Academia
Detector 2 has some requirements first
and foremost you need to install
Anaconda
which is a very versatile and actually
the most popular
Data science platform out there so I
Totally recommend it guys
Next you need cuda cuda is basically a
Parallel programming or pedal computing
platform
And it provides programming models for
processing on gpus
so this is actually the power behind
Anaconda
that makes it possible to process
huge neural networks on your gpus
biotouch
is again another library that's
extremely powerful
and that forms a bridge between anaconda
and cuda
where partridge is able to provide apis
for processing
n dimensional arrays so if you look at
it training a dual network is basically
performing
a huge matrix operations you know on
n-dimensional arrays
and that's done in in through powerdodge
and of course cuda helps in running it
on your gpu or
makes it possible to run on on your gpu
and final
last but not the least uh you need cyton
along with python but that would be
installed with anaconda
whereas saturn is a subset of python
that compiles to c
so we would be
installing that as well so before we
start first and foremost you need to
install anaconda
so if you click on this link which i've
done right now
that will take you to the web page that
would allow you
to download the latest edition of
anaconda so here it is
you come here you just press the
download and
if you are on a 64-bit machine you
choose this
if you are on a 32-bit machine you
choose this most
pieces today are 64-bit machines so here
you go
there we go it's all started and now you
just
press save and that would download
anaconda
on your machine
there we go here it goes nothing
so once it is once it's downloaded guys
just double click it and install it it's
already installed on my machine i won't
do it again
just follow the default recommended
settings don't change anything
that that usually works fine in all
instances
next you need to install cuda as i said
now there's a caveat here so
you need to be sure whether your card
supports the
cuda 10.1 or qr10 and to do that you
need to know the compute capability
of your card so if it's greater than 3.0
it will support qr10
if you want to know how these gpus and
capabilities relate just click this link
and that would take you to the page
where nvidia has placed all the
relevant information pertaining the
compute capability
of different cards and over here you can
see that
tesla c2050 c2070 is 2.0 which means
that it cannot run qr10 whereas k20 k40
k80 can
and c2075 cannot over here in the
nvidia tesla series and nvidia all are
supporting qr10
so and and so on you can get it for all
the different cards out there
so yeah feel free to come here and check
what you need next you need to of course
download cuda so you click here
and that would take you to the qr
website media website where you can
download qr
code 2k 10.1 here's windows at this
instance
x8664 architecture windows
and now you can choose between the
network install or a local install
i usually prefer local but it's 2.4 gb
guys so
it's going to be a lot of data
downloaded so it's up to you again i
won't stalk you the
toolkit now because it's already
installed on my machine again follow the
default
or committed settings don't change
anything and once it's installed you'll
be good to go
all right so it's up to you to choose
let's say for instance here i'm choosing
the network one
and it's just 18.7 mb
and you can say it's
downloadable there we go that
should be quick now if you want to
install the other one
we can do that again or let's say
download that we can do that too here we
are
here goes nothing all right guys so
that's
all the downloads once the qr installed
make sure you install cuda
after this the next stage is where all
the
you know cool stuff happens so first and
foremost we need to
start the anaconda command prompt and
then execute these instructions so
let's do the first thing first let's get
the anaconda command prompt
so you go to when say once the anaconda
installed it would be shown like this
on your um menu go to anaconda prompt 3.
you know there's another one powershell
you can do everything that i i show you
in here as well but
i prefer this because this is less
cryptic than this one so so let's just
go to the normal anaconda
command prompt all right that's cool
so first and foremost we need to create
the environment
and the python version is supposed to be
3.7 so let's confirm this
there we are so that should install
the relevant libraries as well as create
the detectron
environment there we are
of course i want to continue creating
the environment
there we go environment solved sometimes
a certain
environment would not work basic
basically what's happening is it's
looking for
where to download the repository so once
it does
then it's able to resolve the
environment then it would start
downloading stuff and installing it so
over here it wants me to update conda in
your case that might not happen
because you will have the the most
latest version there's no harm in
updating it as well if you want
guys there we go
downloading stuff installing it
there guys conda activate contact
detector
installed so let's activate the
detector environment
and then we can happily go to the next
step
there we are so now you have to install
pi touch so we need to make sure that we
have the correct version which is 1.6
because that's going to work with
detector 2 and of course we're going to
tell it that
it has to you know work with qr2 toolkit
10.1 because that's what's installed
and we channel it to pytorch so this is
one instruction guys
we don't change we don't have new
carriage
here so no enter here so here we are
uh let's say called install
by torch to 1.6
torch vision and what else you need
cuda toolkit 10.1
that should do it click on install power
touch 1.6
dot vision cue the toolkit 10.1 chinese
by torch
now you should uh you should be you
should notice here that for pathwatch we
put
two equals which means that there's a
hard check
it must be part of 1.6 it can't store
anything apart from part or 1.6
whereas in terms of qr toolkit we have
given it more let's say
leeway and it can select something
around 10.1 so it could be 10.1.1 or
10.1.0 and so on so there's a little bit
of flexibility here
there we are it wants to install all
these things and we say yes happily of
course
so in my system most of these libraries
are already downloaded
packages are already downloaded so it's
not asking
to for download on your system it might
download them by the way so don't worry
if that happens
almost there guys
there we go guys we have pi touch
installed now
time to go to the next step install
cyton
of course why not pip install
there we go now you must notice here
that we have moved from conda
to pip now it works much better because
in some ways because
it's going to install it's going to do
exactly what conta did but
you know a bit more relevant to the
package here
next we need buy coco tools so buy coco
tools are basically
a cool set of apis that allow you to
work with coco
dataset basically which is a huge data
set of pictures uh labeled pictures
and so on are used for training uh
neural networks so
let's do this then guys so
hit install i'm just going to move it a
bit
on the side so that i can see what i
need to write so
again it's all one uh line
get plus https
a bit on the side of the slide so i can
see
google api.jet
and then this hash egg by google tools
that should do it let's press enter
there you go guys it's working
there we go all done let's move to the
next step then
there we are now we need to do the
owners of cloning detector into
itself so it's available on our
augmented startups github
and this is the version that works with
windows guys so
please do download this or let's say
clone this
so here we are let's let's do it get
now before we do it let's create a
folder where we would download
everything so let's call it
detecton2 and let's go to cd
do and let's do everything in here so
that
doesn't get lost here we are
github dot com
slash augmented startups
slash detergent
there we are
there you go all done let's see if it's
there
it is there that means we need to go to
the next stage guys
so next most important thing is to
actually install
vc redistribution um now that's
that's actually required to execute the
the
c code within detecton2 so to do that
let's go to our folder where digital 2
is installed so here we are
users so
first users slash
user
here we are and next you know you need
to find detection 2
there we are detecting true again
and here it is now i've copied this here
it's not available on the
default ubuntu based detector tool
repository
it's only available on our repository
just to make it easier for you guys
otherwise
it has to be downloaded from a website
so just double click that
and install it again the normal
recommended install guys i've already
installed and
downloaded installed it so i don't need
to so i'll just move to the next stage
which is actually
to install detector to itself so let's
move into the detector tool folder
and pip install minus e
dot remember this one there we are
now the magic begins
again it's using the cached packages
that it has
downloaded already and of course
downloading the ones that it doesn't
have
quite a bit of work there
hey guys it's all done time to test
our detector how do we do that
for that we need to install the opencv
button because
that's what it needs to actually run all
the
tests because of opencv is used to
read the images and display them so here
we are rip install
opencv button
now that shouldn't take long there we
are
and last but not least let's just check
if it works so let's do python
tests slash test
let's go windows
uh let's install the pi
there we are so it's basically
a set of scripts inside the test folder
there are many out there yeah you can
try them
if you want to have a look we can go
here and
we're going to tests so here we are
there are the different scripts that you
can run there's also
data aspects here about you know
what to do with cocoa and stuff and
and there's
the you know to be used for testing
structures masks
instances image list etc which used
inside
these scripts and of course the modeling
aspects
of the neural networks
let's see how you're doing
that's again take oh no that's actually
my presentation moving forward
and shortly you would actually see
detector 2 doing the same on an image
there we are yay guys it's done
so so you can go into the
the script and change the image
you want to ch you want to uh you know
work with so you go here right click
there you go let's open it with code
there we are so you see it downloads
this image
from here from flickr.com and then
it uses opencv to decode it and finally
uses the configuration and the predictor
to actually run the detector onto and
then finally
visualize it using the visualizer so we
will be discussing that as well
in the in the next tutorial how this api
works but for now it's just
the you know basics here so read image
here
configure your um detector on which
files you want to use
what architecture you want to use here
device that would be running on cuda or
cpu
create a predictor and then finally run
it so
that's all done guys going back to
presentation we have just one more thing
left to do
so while we are at the subject i thought
why not do a bit of google collab so
which is quite easy you just need to
actually
um run a script uh there are few things
you need to look into there so i thought
i might as well
take you through google collab as well
so let's do that
here we are i'll just reconnect because
it's already open
if you if you click the link on my
presentation sites you'll come here
just to check if it's correct early
working let's just refresh that
there we are back and it's uh so
basically
the script shows how to use detecton2
it has everything from images and to
load in
what images need to be loaded in and
what configuration
has to be done what and then the
operation the visualizer
then also you know downloading a new
data set and then training
the the neural network so um i mean
detecting two actually
on these um images running them
and learning uh detection too how it
does
on balloons improving the training
using the train script here as i said
earlier
and then also seeing how the training
went so
that's all there finally when it's
trained better then we'll see what it
really does how it performs
and then finally um you know a bit of
let's just say quantitative assessment
of how the
use of the quality qualitative one now
here is a qualitative quantitative
assessment of how the
neural network is doing again
applying detection to but this time the
key point aspect so if you remember from
my last slides
or the video that the various aspects to
detect onto and over here now we are
getting the key point
uh that is the where you know the
skeletons or the key points of the
of the human body here and then of
course the panoptix segmentation
uh for the same image and
add it to that you can also do that for
a video you can
use the shanghai video here and then
take out six
seconds of it and then apply the
detector and true to that
and then of course see the results so
we'll do all that
it's pretty simple all you need to do is
run all the
the blocks here code blocks
so here goes the first one it will say
it gets authored by this guy ppwi or xse
so you want to run it uh yeah we'll just
run it we trust we just google
guys right
there we are
that's done next we try to install
detector onto
again um
just as we did on windows we are doing
it within our google collaboratory here
you know it's entire environment
in there now this is
uh where you need to be careful guys so
over here
once it's installed everything it's
saying that please restart the runtime
because you need to use the latest or
the newly installed versions of
packages so uh so when you do restart
runtime it will not change any
any of the packages will just you know
restart the
memory and so on uh and the execution
pipeline so just please do that you can
do it from here
when you press restart runtime here or
you can go here
and do restart runtime
say yes what that basically does is
it would bring back other if you noticed
earlier these blocks would become
numbers but
now since it's restarted that means
everything is fresh
so we have to you know
do everything again so here we go we
install we
run this again install the pi
ml yaml and then
detect one to install
see the numbers appearing here
once the install is number three here
now we download the image and load it
there we are configure as i showed you
earlier
in the test windows store install script
so using mask rcnn with r50 feature
payment network
there we are that's that now and we've
also applied the
predictions i mean which means we
actually
applied the detector to using the
default predictor
um so let's see what we have in the
classes and boxes so it says there's 17
class there
25 25 again and 24 and
and these are the locations where it is
so let's display them using visualizer
so it provides this amazing visualizer
to to visualize your results uh detect
onto dudas and it's
really good so let's see
there we are so
that's it guys so there's three 25 so
that's probably persons and
that's done now let's uh do the next
stage which is actually
downloading the balloon data set which
is here
we create when we create this function
to basically you know
how to work with different aspects of
the data loaded so
once you load the images you create this
dictionary
so that it can work with the training
module later on so we'll be using it
later
i think we are done here so let's run
this
so it won't do anything just we just
added
this function there now let's see how
how currently the
um how well it's doing right now
how's the detection 2 working on the
balloon data set
now since it arbitrarily uh reads uh
balloon images
there could be any randomly selected so
it won't necessarily be the same one as
we saw in the earlier one so
it's doing pretty good guys so it's um
it will detect all the balance
but there are instances when it can't so
for that let's
do a bit of training here we are
this is going to perform 300 iterations
for
training let's see if it's it has
started
almost there i think
as you can see it's also reporting the
losses and
the mass loss for the master cnn is
going down as you can see
quite substantially from point six eight
nine nine two point one eight four one
loss in classification loss of
box regression like actually finding the
right boxes
as you can see the classification loss
is also going down
substantially and the total loss is now
0.9532 almost there guys
there we go all done that's awesome
let's see
if we can see the same results on the
tensorboard so let's run the
support again it takes a while for the
tensorboard to load guys so
just wait by the way i'm running this in
internet explorer
uh it might be faster in chrome
perfect so here we are the three edit
iterations and how the
data was processed estimated time of
arrival
in seconds so it changed and let's see
how the
accuracy has changed so you see the
accuracy
rising to 0.95 there
the fourth negatives rising and then
going down
the classification accuracies
foreground classification accuracy that
is affecting the
right boxes lost box regression
going well down classification laws
amazing mass laws again going down
substantially
and and so on so you can have the
regional proposal network laws here as
well
um for classification localization
and so on so even marks rcnn
the accuracy rising the false negatives
going down and then rising again
the false positives going down so i mean
because
so it's quite cool guys what tensorboard
can show you
now let's use this new newly trained
neural network which is lying in the
model final
dot beat which is a model final beat dot
bt edge
and then use it to visualize what we
have
trained so
visualization again here bring the
reading image and
and providing it to the visualizer
there we are awesome the balloon has
been detected
perfectly in all
the pictures that's done
now in this one we'll need
we need we will be checking how are the
ap metrics so
we can we can see them or we can
visualize them
access them using the evaluator here
there it is that's how we create
create evaluator
and then validation loader and then
finally
get the inference and print it using
just the print function
there there we are so the results look
quite good
the next thing we need to do is check if
the key point
rtn works so over here this is the
previous
run or the default run let's see how it
does
there we are it works but uh apparently
this is not what we were expecting right
so what went wrong uh well the problem
is
again now this is not the balloon uh
neural network this is the key
point arsenal and so no balloons have
been detected but the images are
balloon images so why is that think
think guys
oh yeah this this image variable
actually has
a balloon picture in it because it's it
was reading them
in the previous code right as we saw
over here it just read into it the
images of of balloons
so develop from the validation folder
so what we need to do is we need to fix
the image so the easiest way to do that
is just go upstairs where it's actually
reading the
our original image you know you remember
the input.jpg
and just copy this instruction guys from
here
there we are it's copy
control c and then
all we need to do is
place it just before we
launch the predictor so here i copy that
and oops sorry uh you can copy you can
save it in the
you can save this version in your drive
guys i will recommend it so that
you know you don't get this problem
again
or you can just remember to do this
again there we are back to normal
works perfectly now let's see what the
panoptix segmentation
neural network does here
there we are perfectly working there
and now let's see if we can run it on a
video
so here we have a video of somewhere in
shanghai
lovely city isn't it
now somebody's driving in shanghai it
looks cool
um
[Music]
that's from here we are
the awesome youtube libraries available
in python that you can work with and you
know
embed your youtube videos here that's
really awesome guys so
let's pause this and now let's see if we
can so over here we
what we're going to do is uh we're going
to use the youtube dl
to download the video and then use
ffmpeg to
um cut or copy a certain portion of it
into a clip so here we are
we got video downloaded and then the
clip copied
next what we need to do is run the
run the demo.pi of using the panoptic
neural network on the video clip that we
have here
we also can define the confidence
thresholds and
the resulting video that we want um to
see so video output dot mkv
and some other parameters uh about the
model weights
what model weights to get from where so
it's a pickle file available online
there we go
yay i think it's working guys there we
are
so three seconds is about no sorry six
seconds is about 181 frames so 30 frames
per second
multiplied by six uh yeah that's 180
sounds good to me
let's go it's all done and now we use
the google collab
files package to download
the video
there you go that's kind of worked
let's just say open rather than saving
it so that we can see the results
for work
there guys worked amazingly six seconds
and 180 frames processed that looks good
let's play it again i guess
there we are that's all for today folks
that brings us to the end of our
tutorial today
and i will see you in the
