And as the comment suggests, using std::ceil from included <cmath> is better, because indeed, ::ceil is not guaranteed to be the ceil from the C library.
You can specify that you mean std::ceil by writing std::ceil.
In that case, and if you don't feel like including the correct header, it's in the global namespace and accessible as ::ceil.
Use std::ceil inside your customized ceil.
operator double() 
within your class to convert your data to double and call ceil(obj) wherever needed, so, you don;t have ceil as member within your class, and your object gets converted to double (through your cast operator) and std::ceil gets called automatically.
Since the division itself is integer division, it results in 4, so d = 4.0 and math.Ceil(d) is 4.
and you'll have d=4.3 and int(math.Ceil(d))=5.
It's the same as the C++ version: [Fast ceiling of an integer division in C / C++ (hyper-link)]
The ceil() function is implemented in the math library, libm.so.
The prototype of the [ceil (hyper-link)] function is:
To use ceil in C, you would write:
In C++, you can use std::ceil from <cmath>; std::ceil is overloaded to support multiple types:
Check out the link for comments, proof and discussion:
[http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/ceiling-function-c-programming-637404/ (hyper-link)]
Your question asked for a function returning int, but normally the ceil() function returns the same type as its argument so there are no problems with the range (that is, float ceil(float num)).
While if you will use ceil(n/m), output would be 2, which is then assigned to o. i.e, o=2.
The grader probably meant that you needed to use the ceiling of the fraction n/d, and this is perfectly right: this way there will be enough blocks to cover n, the last block possibly being incomplete.
That does not mean that the appropriate implementation is with the C expression ceil(n/d).
You can use ceil((double)n/(double)d) instead.
The signature of ceil is double ceil(double x);.
printf( "%f", ceil((double)5/3) ); should work as you are expecting.
The ceil function receives 1 as a result of the integer division (as the digits after the decimal are discarded) and can do very little from there.
You need to pass a fractional number to ceil for it to do what you want.
The most direct way to take the ceiling of a Decimal instance x is to use x.to_integral_exact(rounding=ROUND_CEILING).
Note that this sets the Inexact and Rounded flags where appropriate;  if you don't want the flags touched, use x.to_integral_value(rounding=ROUND_CEILING) instead.
By the way, in Python 3.x, math.ceil works exactly as you want it to, except that it returns an int rather than a Decimal instance.
That works because math.ceil is overloadable for custom types in Python 3.
In Python 2, math.ceil simply converts the Decimal instance to a float first, potentially losing information in the process, so you can end up with incorrect results.
Because it is slightly higher, it is then going to be rounded up to 193 by ceil.
If you want a little bit of flexibility in ceil, you could always subtract a small epsilon from your number prior to performing ceil.
The ceil funciton works just fine when it returns the number of days.
You didn't use ceil this time!
You should try something like $ds = ceil($days / 30);.
It would probably be more precise to use round instead of ceil, so that 32 days don't translate in 2 months:
Taking the ceil of this rounds up the number of quarter hour chunks.
(The same would be true for the ceiling function.)
If we use our ceiling function to round up from 1:57am DST, we should not end up at 2am DST, but rather at 1:00am STD, which is the result we get:
You can use number format before ceiling.
2.ceil() looks like it'd be a syntax error.
See if 2..ceil() (note the double dots) or (2).ceil() works for you.
The method is Math.ceil, it's not an instance method.
You shouldn't be able to do any of that, unless you have some kind of framework or something that is prototyping .ceil() as a method, in which case it is probably prototyping it as a method on strings.
IOW .ceil() isn't a native javascript method.
Javascript's native "round up" method .ceil() works by using the Math object like
A correctly implemented ceil returns the exact mathematical value of ceil(x), with no error.
When IEEE 754, or any reasonable floating-point system, is in use, ceil is not subject to rounding errors.
This does not prevent adverse effects from sources other than the ceil function.
For example, ceil(1.000000000000000000000000000000001) will return 1 because 1.000000000000000000000000000000001 is converted to a floating-point value before ceil is called, and that conversion rounds its result.
Similarly, a conversion from double to float followed by a call to ceil may yield a value that is not the ceiling of the original double value.
The conversion of the result of ceil to int of course relies on the range of int.
The result of ceil is always exactly an integer, so it will never be rounded down by int (or if you like it will be rounded down, but doing so doesn't change it's value!)
Is not a failure of int or ceil, but simply the fact that 18014398509481985.5 can not be represented exactly:
In summary: if the ceiling of x can be represented exactly then int(ceil(x)) will return the correct integer.
Otherwise int(x) will return the integer returned by ceil(x) which need not be the "mathematical ceiling of x".
Currently, almost all computers conform to IEEE 754 and so you can be sure that int(ceil(x)) returns the correct result according to the standard.
ceil() does not alter the variable provided it returns the result.
There's no ampersand in ceil(monthlyPayment), and monthlyPayment is not a pointer; hence, no modification is possible.
The question does not make sense: floor and ceil round a floating number to an integer.
Since BigInteger values are integers, I assume that you want the the ceiling and floor of division operations.
In the MathContext, you can specify the rounding mode as ceiling or floor (among others).
So either Math.ceil is not pristine and was replaced with some unexpected code or your call of Math.ceil is using the wrong characters.
Try to enter Math.ceil in the browser's console and inspect what it returns.
There is no point in applying ceil() to an integer.
You will need to use mpf_class to get a floating point result from sqrt() and then ceil() should work (but return an mpf_class).
ceil the result
In jq 1.6 you have access to round/ceil/floor functions
Ceiling(may have to add more 9999s to increase precision):
Note that both jq 1.5 and 1.6 have builtins named round, ceil, floor and trunc: they are all 0-arity filters.
To do that, you can use this fact that ceil(x) = x + 1 - {x} such that {x} is the fractional part of x.
Purely for convenience, I'm leaving the ceilings off, since they won't make a difference in the overall analysis.
In doing this analysis, I left out all of the floors and ceilings, which is not mathematically safe to do in all cases.
the least integer greater than x is ceil(x - Îµ)
One-instruction floor/ceil is only available with SSE4.1 roundsd / roundpd, and only for XMM not legacy x87.
The available rounding modes are nearest-even (default), towards +Inf (ceil), towards -Inf (floor), and towards zero (trunc).
and ceil(y)=-floor(-y)=n+1 for y in (n, n+1]
Thus ceil(a/b) = -(-a//b)
You've got to move your decimals over some, then ceil-ify.
Assume WLOG that v is positive (if v were negative, we could swap ceil and floor in the following analysis).
then v is an integer, and so ceil(v) = floor(v) = v, and so both are trivially representable.
then v is in the range [0,1), and so floor(v) = 0, which is representable, and ceil(v) is either zero or one, both of which are representable.
If v is an integer, then ceil(v) = floor(v) = v, so ceil(v) is representable.
Otherwise, ceil(v) = floor(v) + 1, and so also has at most k-1 significant bits and is also representable.
The line std::cin >> X is truncating the fractional part before ceil ever sees the value.
That is, when you invoke ceil you are passing it 10, not 10.42.
You must eliminating the second parameter from ceil, and it should work fine:
np.ceil is one of the ufuncs.
The array returned by np.ceil can also be cast to your desired type, e.g.
np.ceil(x).astype('int').
As ceiling and floor are a type of rounding, I thought integer is the appropriate type to return.
Therefore by using -1, I switch the direction around to get the ceiling, then use another * -1 to return to the original sign.
CEIL and FLOOR only remove decimals - specifically rounding to integer value.
Basically you have to divide it by the desired rounding level, round the rest with ceil/floor, and then multiply back.
Specifically, it is equal to 254, so the result is the double-precision value ceil(x) + 254.0.
Here is a test case that is going to break your code for ceilSearch.
If you want the true ceiling (rounding up to the nearest integer), then you don't want to use BigDecimal#round at all.
To find the ceiling of a number, you want to set the scale, which is the number of digits to maintain after the decimal point.
We can use the enrich my library pattern to add a ceil method to BigDecimal implicitly:
Another thing to bear in mind, that having written 8/3.ceil is actually 8 / (3.ceil), because the .
8.fdiv(3).ceil.
And Ruby also comes with a nice [Rational (hyper-link)] class: (8/3r).ceil.
If you want to round up then just cast the result of a ceilf - casting after rounding shouldn't introduce any errors at all (or, if you want, add one before casting i.e.
something like 2.0 would never accidentally get ceiled to 2
The ceiling of 2.0 is 2; what else would it possibly be?
I am adding this as a supplemental answer for those who come here looking how to use floor and ceil with a CGFloat (like I did).
There is no need to use the C floor and ceil functions anymore.
Ditto for ceil: the description mentions the smallest value that is larger or equal to the input value...
Depending on the scope of where you call ceil, you may need to explicitly call Darwin's ceil function (deep in a closure, etc).
You would have to explicitly import Glibc and call Glibc.ceil(myFloat) instead of using Darwin.
Put simply, you might think calling ceil() rounds a floating-point number up to its nearest integer, but actually it doesn't return an integer at all: if you give it a Float it returns a Float, and if you give it a Double it returns a Double.
The solution is to convert the return value of ceil() to be an integer, like this:
To answer "How to achieve the result similar ceil function in JAVA?
The ceil function is unnecessary since integer division generates integers.
You can wrap this in a ceil but nothing will happen.
The value is 3 before you are calling ceil, because 25 and 8 are both integers.
This is because the expressions are evaluated before being passed as an argument to the ceil function.
You need to cast one of them to a double first so the result will be a decimal that will be passed to ceil.
Not sure there's a block for it, but you could use an mcode block I think and put the Matlab ceil function in it.
and when you call ceil( ) with that value as an argument, the math library correctly returns 223.0.
Since round(), floor() and ceil() only accomplished a portion of the required functionality, I wrote a small function to accomplish the proper rounding.
Ceiling, Floor, and Round functions are then
The way you can do a ceil with integer division is to add 1 less than the denominator:
The problem is the expression a / 2.U is indeed 1.U: if you apply ceil to 1.U you'll get 1.U.
Unfortunatly I do not know a thing about abap, but ceil and floot are generally defined as follows:
The ceiling of a float value is the next highest integer.
To add to Hyperboreus' answer, this is strictly speaking not an ABAP question, as the ceiling and floor functions are generic mathematical functions included in other languages too.
CEIL has the meaning of rounding the number up - to the ceiling...
floor -> 4.0
  ceil  -> 5.0
ceil is return Smallest integer value.
FLOOR returns the nearest Smallest integer 
CEIL returns the nearest Largest Interger
ceil â Round fractions up
floor â Round fractions down
ceil (4.1) = 5
      floor (4.1) = 4
ceil() function used to get the next highest integer value by rounding fractions up whereas floor() function converts a specified numeric value to the next lowest integer value by rounding.
So when you are using ceil(), the value you get and if it contains decimal points it will always be rounded to the next highest integer but floor will round it to the next lowest integer.
More info on ceil and floor can be found here : [http://php.net/manual/en/function.ceil.php (hyper-link)] and [http://php.net/manual/en/function.floor.php (hyper-link)]
There is no operator which divides with ceil.
You need to import math and use math.ceil
In python3, this is just shy of an order of magnitude faster than forcing the float division and calling ceil(), provided you care about the speed.
Note that math.ceil is limited to 53 bits of precision.
The [gmpy2 (hyper-link)] libary provides a c_div function which uses ceiling rounding.
Reminiscent of the [Penn & Teller levitation trick (hyper-link)], this "turns the world upside down (with negation), uses plain floor division (where the ceiling and floor have been swapped), and then turns the world right-side up (with negation again)"
Translate the numerator upwards so that floor division rounds down to the intended ceiling.
The [math.ceil() (hyper-link)] code is easy to understand, but it converts from ints to floats and back.
Also, it relies on Python 3  semantics where "true division" produces a float and where the ceil() function returns an integer.
So they cast cpyBlockSize.x to a float so the result of the division is a decimal, then rounded that decimal up using ceil to achieve the expected behavior.
Anyway, you can emulate Ceil by adding 7 before dividing, and Round by taking the floor or the ceiling depending on the remaining.
We need to show that, for every constant c, there exists n such that 2^(2^ceil(log2(n))) > c * 2^n.
2^(2^ceil(log2(n))) < 2^(2^(log2(n)+1)) = 2^(2n)
The value you get is off by one - it should be 21152967 after ceil.
Your 2.7*3 is probably coming out to be something like 81.0000000000000000001, which ceil()'s up to 82.
For this sort of thing, you'll have to wrap your ceil/round/floor calls with some precision checks, to handle those extra microscopic differences.
If the result is greater than 0.0001, apply ceil() normally.
Convert your number to a string and ceil the string.
The first case is equal to Math.ceil(1) since 3/2 is integer division.
3/2=1 in java so Math.ceil(1)=1.0

So
Math.ceil(3/2) will return 1.0. and Math.ceil(1.5) return 2.0
Because size method return type is int and the end attribute of <s:iterator> eventually will be cast to Integer you can simple add 1 to the size of array list before dividing it and you get same result as using Math.ceil.

BTW if you decide to enable struts.ognl.allowStaticMethodAccess which is not recommended and use Math.ceil method in JSP you need to indicate that you are dividing by a double value (e.g.
2d) or it will be converted to int before passing it to ceil.
So i've tried a couple things, and a friend reached out who found the solution
This piece of code did the trick:
max(ceil({uni_cpo_height} /10)*10,150)
now it rounds up by 10 cm and it starts at 150 cm, even if the input is below 150.
Ceil rounding is identical to truncate rounding for negative quotients, but for positive quotients and nonzero remainders we round away from zero.
The implementation is almost identical to that of div_ceil.
Round will convert 3.3 into 3 while ceil will convert the same into 4.
Math.round is underspecified, and I believe its behavior has actually changed in the past -- see [http://bugs.java.com/view_bug.do?bug_id=6430675 (hyper-link)] -- but generally speaking it behaves like [RoundingMode.HALF_UP (hyper-link)], which has an extensive table of its differences from RoundingMode.CEILING or RoundingMode.FLOOR.
When you * 100 and ceil it, it rounds up to 4071.
from the ceil(3) Linux man page.
ceil_round(1.334,2) gives 1.34
The only way to implement ceil() correctly (assuming you can't implement it using an equivalent assembly instruction) is to do bit-twiddling on the binary representation of the floating point number, as is done in the s_ceil.c source file behind your first link.
Some of the complexities in s_ceil.c stem from the special cases it handles (NaNs, infinities) and the fact that it needs to do its work without being able to assume that a 64-bit integral type exists.
Here's a illustrative version of ceil() for floats that I cobbled together.
You can implement ceil in  manner similar to what you tried, like so (this implementation assumes IEEE-754 double precision):
When you apply ceil or floor to such imprecise result, you may increase or reduce the amount of the error up to a whole number.
In this case you increased the error by ceiling the result from nearly correct integer to exactly following integer).
As you can see the difference is tiny (7.1 * 10^-15) but that still makes it larger than 55, so ceil will round it up.
As for your edit: in general, ceil() and floor() might well be implemented in hardware; for example, on x86, GCC (with optimisations enabled) generates code using the frndint instruction with appropriate fiddling of the FPU control word to set the rounding mode.
But fdlibm's pure software implementations ([s_ceil.c (hyper-link)], [s_floor.c (hyper-link)]) do work using the bit representation directly.
Insertion and lower/upper bounds (that is 'floor' and 'ceil') are all done in O(log n), giving a total runtime of O(m log m).
I am partial to doing a static_cast<int>(ceil(-0.5)); but I don't claim that is "best practice".
I see why ceil(-0.5) is returning -0.0.
It's because for negative numbers, ceil is returning the integer part of the operand:
ceil in C++ comes from the C standard library.
The C standard says that if a platform implements IEEE-754 arithmetic, ceil( ) behaves as though its argument were rounded to integral according to the IEEE-754 roundTowardPositive rounding attribute.
So it is better to use ceil() rather than roundf( ).
ceil()
The C library function ceil(x) returns the smallest integer value greater than or equal to x.
I still dont understand why must of the people use ceil() when computing the number of line since roundf() is more accurate..
while if ceil() is already 4
floor, ceil and round are exact operations.
round, ceil and floor will of course return pow(2, 100) (which won't fit into common integer types and might cause an error).
Further, ceil, round and floor do not introduce errors, but they might amplify existing errors.
floor and ceil can not compensate for that not all integers are
representable.
floor (x) and ceil (x) are always integer values.
Any difference between two numbers floor or ceil (x) and floor or ceil (y) is the difference between two integer values, and therefore an integer.
So without any ceil of floor, the division works pretty like floor.
When (int)ceil((lo + hi) / 2.0);:

if( ( $var - intval( $var ) ) >= 0.5 )
  $var = ceil( $var )
You can use replace function to replace the time part to make it floor and add one day to make it ceil
Ceiling needs if..else statement since if you would ceil 2020-07-24 00:00:00 one would not expect to get 2020-07-25 00:00:00
ceiled =  roughtime is okay (no need to make a copy), since datetime objects are immutable.
ceil() : Returns the closest integer greater than the input value.
ceil(204.8) â 205
In this case, if your criteria required an image of at least 80% of the original I would use ceil().
You're right that if sqrt is the ceiling of the square root, then you'll never reach 1 by repeatedly applying square roots.
The ceil function is a function that histplot uses under the hood.
This leads to the error you get, it cannot find the ceil function.
I suspect the ceil function has the same functionality as the ceiling function, but I'm just speculating here.
Probably the ceil function is part of a package on which the histplot package depends.
From your comment it turned out you needed to also load the matlab package, which contains the ceil function.
You can just multiply by 100, take the ceiling of that new number (32131.125 => 32132), then divide that by 100.
You could multiply by 100, ceil that value and divide by 100 again, ie
[code snippet]
so use for ceiling number
That integer 0 will then be cast to a double precision float for the call to ceil, but ceil(0) is 0.
So, your current statement ceil([myNSArray count]/3) should be changed to either:
If the latter, don't use ceill; instead use:
If x is an exact square, the ceiling and the floor of the square root are equal; otherwise, the ceiling is one more than the square root.
I mean, the purpose of ceil() and floor() is to round up and down numbers to a whole number (integer) after all?
If you want to ceil or floor a number with a rough value of 10^100, you cannot fit that into an int or a long, so only a float (or double) will do.
Since SAS time is actually a number of seconds since midnight, CEIL will give you start of next second.
Math.ceil does, indeed, cast the integer to a double.
This happens without any consideration for the method-call to Math.ceil it is embedded in.
[Math.ceil() (hyper-link)] only accepts type double, but that's not a problem because Java can perform the conversion automatically and turn the int 0 to a double 0.0.
With some expressions E, particularly constants, the compiler can evaluate ceil(E) while it is compiling, and it does so if this optimization is not disabled.
Then the compiler generates code that uses the result and does not call ceil.
When the compiler fails to evaluate ceil(E) during compilation, it generates code that calls ceil.
Then, when the linker is processing the math library, it will know that main references ceil, so it will extract from the math library the module that defines ceil.
Thus gcc -std=c99 -lm main.c -o main will work with source code that uses only constants with ceil but will not work with the source code in the example, but gcc -std=c99 main.c -lm -o main will work.
Neither Python built-in nor numpy's version of ceil/floor support precision.
my_ceil(11) will return 12.
The problem is that you are applying ceil to the outer expression.
For example, ceilDiv(1,2) = -floorDiv(-1,2) =-(-1)= 1 (correct answer).
For floor and ceil the reasons are the same, but note that:
ceil and floor by definition return integers, so how come they don't return ints
On a similar topic, ceil and floor by definition return integers, so how come they don't return ints?
At times you want ceil() and floor() to return something other than an integer, e.g.
Ceil : cast ( x as int ) + ( x > cast ( x as int ))
Take integer part of x and add 1 if decimal value is greater than 0
Floor : cast ( x as int ) - ( x < cast ( x as int ))
Take integer part of x and subtract 1 if decimal value is less than 0
Ceil :
SELECT (cast ( amount as int ) + ( amount > cast ( amount as int ))) AS amount
FROM SALES WHERE id = 128;
Floor :
SELECT (cast ( amount as int ) - ( amount < cast ( amount as int ))) AS amount
FROM SALES WHERE id = 128;
I have checked all the corner cases including negative number with MySQL ceil() and floor() functions.
You can use ROUND() to the effect of CEIL and FLOOR if you add or subtract 0.5 from the number on hand.
Ceil : SELECT ROUND(amount+0.5, 0) AS amount FROM SALES WHERE id = 128;
Floor : SELECT ROUND(amount-0.5, 0) AS amount FROM SALES WHERE id = 128;
This means that in your code, you could still do things like multiply the $amount wherever you need to, but whenever you need to display to the user a 'ceiled' version of the number, you just ask for it as a one off i.e.
So you never save the ceiled amount as the variable, you just display it to the user while a more accurate variable exists in your code.
First, your flooring() function does not do the opposite of the ceiling() function, as for example serialize() and unserialize() do.
But even if you had an unceiling() function, it would have no means to determine which value between x00 and x99 it should return.
Because Math.ceil (I suppose it's a static import there) returns a double.
Also, please note that the argument you pass to ceil is the ratio of two integers, which is also an integer.
Moreover, applying ceil to an integer is redundant, as it will return that integer itself.
And the last remark: ceil expects a double as its argument.
The reason is that [Math.ceil returns a double (hyper-link)].
i / j is already 3, and all Math.ceil does is return 3.0, which then again gets casted to 3.
...and then calling math.ceil() on 2 returns 2.
Here's a quick example where it beats out ceil:
Perl is smart enough to round that to 3 when printing it, but when you explicitly use a floating point function, it will do exactly what it advertises: ceil that to the next integral number: 4.
Your solution of ceil("$n") works because Perl rounds a floating point number to around 14 decimal places when converting it to a string (thus converting 3.000000000000000444 back to 3).
But a faster solution would be to subtract epsilon (since ceil will round up) before computing ceil:
You're trying to ceil an array, you can do it on a numeric value.
You're doing an integer division and passing the result to ceil().
Hence, the ceil() call has no effect.
Divide by 100000 before ceiling, then multiply with 100000:
Applying ceil to it, as you saw, is pointless.
val: 12.190000000000001 floor: 12.19 ceil: 12.2
And the ceil of that number is 111.
Using the ceilf operator fixed it for me:
The thing is that firstly the conversion goes to Integer, where (14/10) is 1, and then it ceils it to 1.
1.4 is a double, so it makes it ceil as a double number.
floor and ceil are classed as floating ufuncs.
If we make a query [1,6] (zero-based indexes) it will use 4 vertices (they are black on the image), and 4 > ceil(log_2(8)) = 3
As pointed out in comments, ceil returns a double, but if you don't specify a prototype for a function, a compiler must assume that the function returns int and that the types of the arguments (after applying the [default argument promotions (hyper-link)]) are the same as the types of the function parameters.
When the actual function is called, since the type of the parameter is wrong (ceil expects a double but you passed it an int), the behavior is undefined.
So it's likely in this case that ceil, looking for a double argument, found only whatever garbage happened to be in the register for floating-point arguments; and the caller, expecting an int return value, found only whatever garbage happened to be in the register for integer returns.
When k is a multiple of x, then ceil(k/x) = k/x since k/x is an integer.
k/x-1, which equals ceil(k/x)-1.
When k is not a multiple of x, then ceil(k/x) is k/x rounded up to the next integer, and floor(k/x) is k/x rounded down to the next lower integer.
Obviously, ceil(k/x) - 1 = floor(k/x).
And since k is not a multiple of x, it's obvious that (k-1/x) and k/x will give the same result when rounding down to the next lower integer; thus, ceil(k/x) - 1 = floor(k/x) = floor((k-1)/x).
Now ceil(k/x) = 300, floor((k-1)/x) = 200.
Or try k=4.1, x=2: ceil(k/x) = 3, floor((k-1)/x) = 1.
It makes no sense for the Java library to provide both ceil(float) and ceil(double) as all float arguments can be passed to the ceil(double) method with the same result.
Unless you're calling a different ceil() function1, or printing the result in the wrong way, it should work fine:
1 Such as double ceil (double x) { return 1031.0; } :-)
ceil() will never return anything besides an Integer as the documentation (even if it is cast as a float), and Dave pointed out.
The entire point of ceil is to round up to the nearest integer :-)
I think the syntax to provide ceil is
This module provides amongst others the ceil and floor functions:
Take this code and put it in a file ceil.c:
A modern compiler might well optimize the code to pass 2.0 directly to printf() without calling ceil() at all at runtime, so there'd be no need for the maths library at all.
This answer shows that in use: the -lm comes after the source file ceil.c.
If you're building with make etc, then you typically use ceil.o on the command line (along with other object files); normally, you should list all the object files before any of the libraries.
You could use the div function in cstdlib to get the quotient & remainder in a single call and then handle the ceiling separately, like in the below
The program calculates 3/2 as an int therefore the result is 1, and then the second ans calculation is actually by ceil(1.0)
Instead ceil(3 / 2), you need to do ceil(3.0 / 2.0).
In this situation, the program calculates this as a double and the result will be 1.5, meaning the second ans calculation is by ceil(1.5).
Actually your are sending different arguments to function ceil
So you are actually calling ceil(1) for the second time
Total number of nodes= n + (n-1) = 2n-1 Now, we know its a full binary tree and thus the height is: ceil(Log2(n)) +1
of nodes = 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + â¦ + 2^ceil(Log2(n)) // which is a geometric progression where 2^i denotes, the number of nodes at level i.
of nodes = 1*(2^(ceil(Log2(n))+1) -1)/(2-1)
= 2* [2^ceil(Log2(n))] -1 (you need space in the array for each of the internal as well as leaf nodes which are this count in number), thus it is the array of size.
Raising 2 to the power of x above, ensures that we get the nearest ceiling integer which is:
Thus, Size of the Segment Tree Array = [2*2 ^ (Ceil[ Log_2 (N) ] )] - 1
One way would be to do ceil(value*100)/100, but that seems inelegant.
The function to 'round up' is [CEIL (hyper-link)], but it generates an integer.
Note that CEIL rounds to an integer; to round to 2 dp, you'd have to multiply by 100, use CEIL, and divide by 100.
select 4.01132141, CEIL(4.01132141*100)/100 from dual

You could write your own ceil function and include it in whatever your output code is for your target device.
Now your C-code can call integerValuedNumber = ceil(doubleValuedNumber) and it should work.
EDIT 2: I corrected the return data type of our self-defined ceil function.
If the values you are applying ceil to are not very large (less than +/- 2^15 for instance) then int is probably fine.
Nothing changes if the problem is with sqrt() or ceil(), because they are in the same library (math.h).
In other words, you can safely cast the result of ceil or floor to an integer, as long as that integer can hold the value.
Assuming the result of ceil fits in the range of int (or whatever the casted type may be), the cast is safe.
Since the result of ceil is a integer, it can be expressed exactly in binary so there is no rounding error, and is thus safe to cast.
The variable paintRequiredCeiling is only available in your calculate function.
You're missing an important step: you need to check if the number is already integral, so for ceil assuming non-negative numbers (generalisation is trivial), use something like
double my_ceil(double x)
Different handling needed   if x is negative/positive when code is ceil() or floor().
The functions ceil() and floor() will return different numbers than what you get by using
Unless you want to deal with positive and negative numbers differently, and the special cases of when test is integral number, you are better off using ceil() and floor().
The ceil and floor functions work on double types.
Let's break down what happens when you do ceil(a/b).
First, an integer division happens between a and b, so 63/32 becomes (int)1, and then this 1 is casted to double to become 1.0, and then ceil(1.0) is of course just 1.0.
ceil(double(a) / double(b)) uses double division.
a/b will perform an integer division since they are integral types, which will result in 1, this explains why [std::ceil (hyper-link)] returns the value you are seeing.
Perhaps ceil( (float)((Size - 1) / BPC) )?
ceil( (float)(Size / BPC) ) does integer division, then casts that to float.
You need ceil( (float)Size / BPC ) to do that correctly.
The second argument is the precision, the flag tells round to always round up (like ceil)
So, ceil() was still being called for each element, but since it didn't take the value as a reference, it didn't update the array.
You can create "your own ceil function".
The reason it doesn't work is because ceil($param) expects only one parameter instead of two.
It is (almost) never a good idea to use a ceil() or sign() function.
You can simulate a ceiling function in a MIP model as follows:
Assuming your start and end columns are already of type datetime, you can use [.dt.floor (hyper-link)] and [.dt.ceil (hyper-link)] with 10min as frequency:
Floor removes the decimal point, ceil turns the decimal part into .9999 repeating if it's already there (which is the same as a whole number).
So floor(4.6) loses the .6, ceil(4.6) becomes 4.9999... or 5.
Also, ceil(5.0) will return 5, as the decimal part is 0.
ceil(3) = 3
ceil(3.4) = 4.0
The [Oracle CEIL documentation (hyper-link)] states:
CEIL returns smallest integer greater than or equal to n.
So CEIL(5.416579) function will always return 6 in Oracle.
The only way I can see for you to get a different result is if someone has create a user-defined CEIL function in your schema and that is being invoked rather than the built-in function:
But even then, SELECT CEIL(5.416579) FROM DUAL appears to use the global built-in function and returns 6.
Check you don't have another function called CEIL but without that, the behaviour you are describing should be impossible.
The compiler only complains about pow() and not floor() or ceil() probably because it generates inline code for floor() and ceil() and an external call for pow() which cannot be resolved at link time because you forgot the m library on the command line: -lm stands for link with libm.a.
It might do that for ceil() and floor() and not for pow(), which would also explain the observed behavior.
For some reason, the compiler generates inline code only for floor and ceil, as observed.
If you modify the code to store the values into global variables, library calls to floor(), ceil() and pow() are generated without optimization and the values are computed by the compiler if you optimize with -O2.
Floor and ceil might be in some other library, generally the compiler is not required to diagnose missing headers or libraries.
But yours is not a compiler error but a linker error, that is your program compiles fine, but then when linking if you don't use -lm it is unable to find the implementation of pow() but it actually finds the implementation of ceil().
That is probably because in your architecture/configuration ceil() is an inline or intrinsic function, maybe there is a simple CPU instruction to do it, so no library is necessariy.
Tinkering about that I found the file /usr/include/bits/mathinline.h with the inline implementations of ceil() and floor()...
The CEIL(a, b) kernel macro is completely different from the ceil() C library function.
No, one can't convert above macro into ceil in-kernel function, as there is no such function in kernel.
floor and ceil are fine.
The ceil of this is 8,388,608.
Behavior seems to return to normal if I do: ceil(8'388'609.5F) which will correctly return 8,388,610.
That value was passed to ceil, which of course returned 8,388,610.
ceil only has an effect if there is a fractional part of the number.
A final point of explanation here, is the range over which ceil will have an effect.
After the exponent of a floating point is larger than numeric_limits<T>::digits continuing to increase it only introduces trailing zeros to the resulting number, thus calling ceil when q is greater than or equal to numeric_limits<T>::digits - 2LL.
And since we know the MSB of c will be used in the number this means that c must be smaller than (1LL << numeric_limits<T>::digits - 1LL) - 1LL Thus for ceil to have an effect on the traditional binary IEEE-754 floating point:
It should round up as what $ceil does.
Then it can do ceil / round by subtracting that from the total, calling the built in functions, then adding the result back on
UPDATE: See my improved answer here: [How to ceil, floor and round bcmath numbers?
floor/ceil take one argument, and round it down or up to the nearest integer.
Floor and ceiling are used for single numbers.
floor() and ceiling() truncate a double into an integer as in
ceil is the smallest integer greater than n.
The function round() rounds towards or away from zero, while the functions ceil() and floor() round toward positive infinity and negative infinity;
Ceil Round a number upward to its nearest integer.
And when this "very close to 4.11" number is multiplied by 100, the ceil of the product turns out to be 412, much to your surprise!
The ceil(x) function returns the smallest integral number not less then x.
your compiler represents constant 4.11 as a slightly larger number so 4.11*100 happens to be slightly larger than 411 so ceil(4.11*100) == 412 (because 412 is the smallest number not less than the number slightly larger than 411), but 1.21 is represented as slightly smaller number so 1.21*100 is slightly smaller than 121 so ceil(1.21*100)==121.
Approach #1 : Use np.where to do the choosing between floor and ceil based on the positivity/negativity -
Approach #2 : We could extend the sign trick used in [@Mitch's post (hyper-link)] by using a comparison against zero and scaling to get the sign equivalent and also leverages [numexpr module (hyper-link)] to perform the ceil on abs values.
You can use this syntax 
[ np.ceil(x) if x>0 else np.floor(x) for x in lst) ]
Another option (though not a built-in) could be taking the ceiling of the absolute values.
I don't get; the Math#ceil(double) method takes a double as an argument but anyway, instead of regex, perhaps you should try simply parsing the argument passed in to the ceil method as a double; if it throws an exception, it means that it isn't a valid double:
final boolean valid = validArgument("Math.ceil(45.97)"); which should return true.
BTW, if you would prefer to have 5.00001 rounded to 5.00000 instead of 6.00000, use rint instead of ceil.
Since ceil always produces an integer value (albeit represented as a double), we will always have some value X, for which the first produces X.0 and the second X.1.
Therefore, before ceil(N)+0.1 could overflow, the a/b being used as an input in sqrt(a/b) would have to have overflowed already.
Similarly, if the library guarantees errors are less than 1 ULP, then ceil must return the exact result, again because the exact result is representable and any other result would be at least 1 ULP away.
Additionally, the nature of ceil is such that I would expect any reasonable math library to always return an integer, even if the rest of the library were not high quality.
As for overflow cases, if ceil(x) were beyond the range where all integers are exactly representable, then ceil(x)+.1 is closer to ceil(x) than it is to any other representable number, so the rounded result of adding .1 to ceil(x) should be ceil(x) in any system implementing the floating-point standard (IEEE 754).
It is possible to change the rounding mode to something like round-toward-infinity, which could cause ceil(x)+.1 to be an integer higher than ceil(x).
E.g., subtract 0.3 and ceil it.
You need ceil:
O(ceil(log n)) and O(log n) both represent the same asymptotic complexity (logarithmic complexity).
Or loosely put : O(ceil(log n)) = O(log n)
That's clearly more than 1, and less than 2, so ceil will round it up to 2.
Looking at the [ceil source code (hyper-link)] on github, it seems that it is dependent on your C library's ceil function.
If what you appear to be asking is how to use floating points including their correct non-absolute errors in deciding a ceil outcome, the following should guide you:
2) You are caring about floats (as the single input value) when using ceil($float) when ceil will only ever round up to the nearest integer so whatever the floating value is, is irrelevant.
To answer the original question of Considering floating point errors, is it ever possible to get a result one point higher than it should be from a ceil($a / $b) where the rest of $a / $b is 0?
I guess this doesn't really have anything to do with ceil() but rather with if the division in question returns a float or integer type value.
So using at least one float value could produce a ceil() "error", but I should be fine with two integers.
Shouldn't you be looking at the return value of math.ceil?
So change number=math.ceil(number) number=math.ceil(number)
So unless you're trying to round up, you won't need ceil.
Although to answer the title question, you can use Math.ceil on an input string, assuming the string can be parsed into a double.
Can ceiling only be used in one number?
You can not use Math.ceil on any sort of collection to find the highest value as you wish to do.
And there's no need for the if statement deciding on when to use floor or ceil since round already defaults to this logic.
Or slightly cleaner with ceil:
If you want floor/ceil of time other than seconds, use date_trunc().
As for your suggested "guaranteed floor/ceil", it's not a good idea.
Certain sequences of operations can easily blow the error far above 1e-10, and certain other use cases will require 1e-10 to be correctly recognized (and ceil'ed) as nonzero.
You can use round or you can subtract 0.5 then use std::ceil function.
It is possible that you have misunderstood what "floor" and "ceil" were supposed to be.
It is possible that what you are looking for is the largest value less than k in the tree, for floor, and the smallest value more than k in the tree, for ceil.
If you are using old python versions, you should result from round, math.floor, math.ceil and math.trunc pass to build-in int function:
in above code if you give 5.21 it will give 5.25.
if you want 5.21 to convert into 5.20 then change the ceil to round
Here is the code that do floor/ceil on pre SSE4.1 CPU.
But even C# and other modern languages usually return a floating value for ceil just for consistency.
ceil() takes a double as an argument.
So, if it were to return an integer, what integer type would you choose that can still represent its ceiled value?
So, it makes sense to return a double value for ceil().
OP starts with two integers a,b and questions why a function double ceil(double) that takes a double, does not return some integer type.
A  big reason double ceil(double) does not return an integer type is because that limited functionality is rarely needed.
ceil(DBL_MAX) is not expected to fit in an integer type.
Although ceil means to round up to the next whole number , it doesn't mean strictly that it is an integer, it's obvious that an integer is a whole number but that doesn't have to prejudice our mind.
logs ["cos", "pow", "log", "tan", "sqrt", "ceil", "asin", "abs", "max", "exp", "atan2", "random", "round", "floor", "acos", "atan", "min", "sin"] in no particular order.
You are using the function in the right way, the problem is that the compiler can't find the ceil() function, probaly due to linking errors with the <math.h> library.
check this: [Math Ceil (hyper-link)]
Since your input is an integer and your output is an integer too,
it would be cleaner to implement your own ceiling function:
The frequency level to ceil the index to.
You're trying to bind a formula to a prepared query placeholder, which is not allowed; you can only bind values, so your ceil((supplier_price-local_price)/21) is being treated as a string, which is an illegal value for an integer column.
To compute the ceiling of n / m integrally, just say:
Ceiling of integer division:
So You should bring these values evaluated form controller or write down the logic here is qweb as ceil() does not have any complicated logic.
you want ceil without using ceiling...
Note: ceil round up
What's happening is you are not assigning the  value from Math.ceil(num) to anything.
You aren't assigning the value of Math.ceil.
To print the ceiling of num you can either put the call in sys out or just try following code:
Round Up (Ceil) -> ceil(x) = round(x + 0.5).
It is quite straightforward to do what you require, either by creating a Template plugin to handle the ceil function, or through the Template USE var = Class(module) construct.
I haven't researched it, but I'd be surprised if there weren't Template plugins to do functions like ceil(), floor() and so on already out there on CPAN.
Rounding conversions mean rounding Â± float/double to nearest floor/ceil float/double.
It may be worth noting that if you wanted an integer result from the rounding you don't need to pass it through either ceil or floor.

like you said you have to use math ceil to round up ,so you can pass true if you want to round up or you can pass false to round it down 
you could use
The formula for the number of nodes of height 'h' in an 'n' element heap is given as ceil(n/2^(h+1))
A heap of size n has at most ceil(n/2^(h+1)) nodes with height h
If you know that both values are positive, you can calculate the ceil in purely integer (or long long) with:
The compiler found several versions of 'ceil' and want you to tell it which one to use.
Use the preprocessor to find out where it got 'ceil' from and fix your includes.
Example from [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/clibrary/cmath/ceil/ (hyper-link)]
It might be a collision between std::ceil and ceil (if you use an evil using namespace std).
It is possible that the compiler doesn't know which version of ceil to use ceil(float foo) or ceil(double foo).
This uses [copysign (hyper-link)] to get a properly signed 1.0 value that is then used to make the value positive, round it away from 0 using [ceil (hyper-link)], then restore the proper sign to the result.
We can work out how to perform predecessor and successor searches (what you're calling floor and ceiling) in a trie, then adapt those approaches to work in a TST.
Functions like ceil and sqrt are in libmath
The problem you're having with the ceil() function is that you're using integer operands for the division.
And few more things besides the ceil function:
You should avoid the call to ceil completely, there is no need to convert things to double, make a function call and convert back.
As stated in the comments you can use: [floor (hyper-link)] and [ceil (hyper-link)]
Matlab indexing starts from 1, ceil() will transform 0.8 to 1
Matlab index can only take integer values ceil() always returns an integer
To confirm the preference for using ceil(), one should have a look on those methods documentation, by typing open ceil on the command window for example
ceil()
The only alternative was using rand() and ceil() or rand() and floor() to generate uniformly distributed random integers.
In short, using ceil() and rand() you can generate random number on
  all Matlab versions while randi() works only on versions later than 2008b version.
To prove that (ceil(lg lg n))!
Try ceil($num / 7) * 7.
You might look at [floor() (hyper-link)] and [ceil() (hyper-link)] for round-down and round-up respectively.
You should use [floor (hyper-link)] and [ceil (hyper-link)].
The prototype is not int floor nor int ceil, but they do return an integer value.
Therefore, under IEEE 754, floor and ceil always work correctly (note that x86 uses IEEE 754 representations).
How about using [ceil (hyper-link)]
Do not do multiplication inside a ceil function!
For example ceiling(2.2200001, 2) will give 2.23.
Next, when ceil(n/2) is 2, rounds(n) will be 3.
then, when ceil(n/2) is 3 or 4, the result will be 4.
3 <= ceil(n/2) <= 4 happens if and only if 2*3-1 <= n <= 2*4, so
If I understood you question right, I guess, you can do ceil(a) in this case, and then check if the result is less then b.
Thus, for example, for interval [1.3, 3.5], ceil(1.3) will return 2, which fits into this interval.
You can also perform ceil without using math.h as following:
You can do a similar thing to get ceil behavior.
Referring the undefined reference to ceil():
#includeing math.h is for the compiler to get to know ceil()'s defintion.
The linker then later needs to know where ceil()'s implementation actually resides, namely in libm.
So it is not ceil(m/2), but ceil(m/2)...m, and it is not granted but achieved, it is a goal.
When a full node is split into two, you will have a floor(m/2) and a ceil(m/2) node (if m is even, the two are the same), and the new entry is added to the smaller one.
Then both becomes something greater or equal to ceil(m/2).
even case: m=4, m/2=2=ceil(m/2)=floor(m/2), results after adding new entry are 2 and 3, both >=2
odd case: m=5, ceil(m/2)=3, floor(m/2)=2, the latter gets new entry, they become 3 and 3, both >=3.
Donald Knuth's ceil(m/2) definition.
Find number of bit for subnets: For 10 subnets, one requires ceil(log2(10)) = 4 bits
Find number of bits for hosts: For 3110 hosts, one requires ceil(log2(3110)) = 12 bits, and it works since 2**12 = 4096 > 3110 + 2
In this case, math is the module, and exp, sqrt, ceil are functions it defines.
The whole point of ceil/floor operations is to convert floats to integers!
The point of the ceil and floor operations is to round floating-point data to integral values.
Note that it would not be possible to implement a round to integral value as trivially if all you had available were a ceil or float operation that returned an integer.
Additionally, you must have versions of ceil and floor which return floating-point numbers if you want to conform to [IEEE 754 (hyper-link)].
The python functions are wrappers of the C function and so this is really a deficiency of the C functions where they should have returned an integer and forced the programer to do the range/NaN/Inf check before calling ceil/floor.
The use of floor() as a numerical math concept goes back to 1798 per the Wikipedia page on the subject: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions#Notation (hyper-link)]
You could simply multiply your float value by 1000 and ceil it and then divide by 1000 to achieve your desired value.
ceil(data * 1000.0) / 1000.0
When you call ceil(36/32) you're dividing two integers, so you get an integer as a result (1 in this case).
Try dividing doubles: ceil(36.0/32.0).
The values '36' and '32' in the line 'dbl = ceil(36/32);' are integers.
This means the result of '36/32' 32 is 1, and 'ceil(1)' is 1.
Anyway using the ceil() function is an heavy job for such simple problem, it is more simple to act on solutions that avoid the use of ceil and floats (as many of that above).
[ceil (hyper-link)] is supposed to do just that.
Now even if you assign this to the float chunkSize it will still be an integer(missing the double part) and ceil, round and floor will all return the same value.
Math.ceil() will do the work.
now you can apply Math.ceil() to get the upper value.
Math.ceil(chunkSize); will result in 12.0
If you are working with Spring then you can add a bean that has the method you want Math.ceil.
Have you tried setting the rounding mode to ROUND_UP, rather than ROUND_CEILING?
From what I understand about floor and ceil, there does not appear to be a more optimal option.
You don't need to use either ceil or floor function for implementing binary search in python.
You actually do not need to use ceil or floor @shivam_mitra mentioned.
if you're doing int/long division, it'll truncate any fractional component before it gets to the Math.ceil.
So clayneeded/7500000000L is integer division (quotient), thus ceil computes the ceiling of an integer, so itself.
So you can compute it like this (if the remainder of the integer division is not nul then the ceiling must produce the next integer) :
$totalPages = ceil($totalRows/$rpp);
So Matlab passes a string to floor or ceil, the function forces the argument to convert to a numeric matrix, and then the function doesn't further modify those values since they're already integers.
From a comment on [http://php.net/manual/en/function.ceil.php (hyper-link)]:
You could divide by 10, ceil(); and then multiply by ten
One more solution for ceil with precision, no pow, it looks like works 9 digits both sides:
As version ceil(pow(10, $precision) * $value) / pow(10, $precision); fails in some cases, e.g.
My guess is that GCC optimizes ceil(2.5) to a constant, whereas ceil(n) is not constant because n is not known when compiling calc.c, and it needs to reference the function.
Here we see ceil being referenced.
gcc has a list of [built-in functions (hyper-link)] and ceil is one of them.
On my version of OSX, gcc uses the built-in ceil in both of your cases so -lm is not necessary.
Apparently your Gentoo compiler behaves differently and only uses the built-in ceil in some cases.
you have 3 possibility : round(), floor(), ceil()
[ceil (hyper-link)]
That will mimic Excel's ceiling function.
round rounds towards the closest integer (breaking ties by choosing even numbers), math.floor rounds towards -inf and math.ceil rounds towards +inf.
It's also worth noting that round(x,0) returns a float while round(x), floor(x) and ceil(x) return integers.
On the other hand, math.floor and math.ceil explicitly take the closest integer that is smaller and larger than the input values, respectively.
Similarly,  the closest integer that is larger than or equal to the input (i.e., closest to +inf) is -1, which is why math.ceil(-1.4) yields -1.
Here are the links to Python's documentation for [floor (hyper-link)] and [ceil (hyper-link)]
I assume that math.ceil was around before long integers were introduced, but I don't have enough Python history to know for sure.
By keeping the ceil function separate from the int conversion it's easy to see which part is the source of the surprise.
For all other remainders 0<b<d, the division returns the next integer a+1, ie the ceiling.
Since dividing two integers a and b will always floor (truncate) the result, we need to find some d (delta) such that floor(d + a/b) == ceil (a/b).
Think about it this way:
ceil(a/b) > floor(a/b), except when (a/b) is a whole number.
So, we want to bump (a/b) to (or past) the next whole number, unless (a/b) is a whole number, by adding d. This way floor(a/b + d) will be equal to ceil(a/b).
Summing it up, we know adding d = 1 - (1/b) to (a/b) will fulfill the equality:
floor(a/b + d) = ceil(a/b).
Both methods are shown in the below fiddle along with comparisons to the internal ceil function and unfortunately neither epsilon methods match the internal method exactly but do ok up to an arbitrary precision.
Number.EPSILON provides the correct answer for X = 1, but for larger numbers, the largest number n less than one such that (X + n) >> 0 === ceil(X) is based on the exponent of the number.
I'm pretty sure this is slower than ceil(X), but it was fun to figure out.
For something that's actually faster than ceil, this gives a lower bound that shows that
This is faster than native ceil.
ceil doesn't change the value you passed (it cannot - float values are immutable); instead, it returns the elaborated value - that you are discarding, as you aren't assigning it to anything.
Kotlin has [ceil (hyper-link)] in it's kotlin.math library, but it rounds to the next whole number.
For ceil(a,b) function you can use the formula ceil=1+floor((a-1)/b)
ceil(d) : floor(d);
It will be faster, than a version with ceil and floor.
It would work like Math.floor and Math.ceil if the scale were 0:
Without Math.ceil() it can be done so:
First use ceil() to obtain the smallest integer not smaller than a, then obtain the smallest odd integer not smaller than ceil(a) by doing a bitwise or with 1 to ensure the last bit is set without changing anything else.
If the representation of signed integers is not two's complement, but ones' complement or sign-and-magnitude (I don't know whether Javascript allows that, Java doesn't, but it's a possibility in C), the value of a must be larger than -1 -- the result of Math.ceil(a) resp.
Therefore, ceil() isn't going to get you what you want here, because the value being passed to it is already floored.
divide by 20 and use ceil, then multiply by 20
The documentation for ceil() can be found [here (hyper-link)].
As a small aside, if you want to round to the nearest base, instead of rounding up, use [round() (hyper-link)] instead of ceil().
ceil(x/2)*2
ceil can be used unqualified due to ADL ([What is "Argument-Dependent Lookup" (aka ADL, or "Koenig Lookup")?
You can use the Math.ceil function

Math.ceil( number / 100 ) * 100 should work.
If you do Math.ceil(7435/100) it will give you 75 and multiplying by 100 will give you 7500.
Ceil does not only work with decimals.
The ceil ufunc doesn't support calculations involving integers, so it fails:
Another naive attempt here as the function is ceiling.
ceil(x) will compute the closest integer which is greater than x
B = ceil(A) rounds the elements of A to the nearest integers greater than or equal to A.

Then we can easily know why round(8.5)=9 and ceil(8.5)=9.
the notation  [image]  around 93/10*x is ceiling function.

The reason they used Math.ceil(...) in the Java portion is because of the partial brackets in the mathematical expression.
Take a look at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions (hyper-link)] for more information on mathematical expressions for floor and ceiling.
If you want it to behave differently on powers of 10, play with 1+Math.floor above (0/1, floor/ceil/round).

then you can still use return ceil(c); but I think in current state it is OK already
Update: Apple have now defined some CGFloat-specific versions of common functions like ceil:
If you simply use ceil with a CGFloat argument it should now work on all architectures.
To use ceil I will first make the CGFloat a Double and after ceiling, I convert it back to CGFloat.
You could also define a ceil for floats (This has been actually implemented in Swift 2):
I actually believe this should be the solution chosen by Apple, instead of having separate ceil and ceilf functions because they don't make sense in Swift.
Darwin provides a ceil(_:) function that has the following declaration:
The Playground code below shows how to use ceil(_:) in order to round up a CGFloat value:
If you want 1-4, then use ceil() instead.
However, I suspect that the real problem is that you should not be using ceil in that calculation.
Rounding-off a Double or Float using round(), ceil() or floor() all have one thing in Common and that is: by using them you are subscribing to losing the Precision of your Data.
[eugene y (hyper-link)]'s solution might work as it will prevent auto exporting into your namespace, but be sure to prefix any calls to ceil and so on with POSIX::.
It could be that the result in the last case is 3.00000000000001 so its ceiling is 4 not 3 (and then is multiplied by 0.1)
If you have 0.3 < p.y < 0.4 then you will have 3 < p.y/dy < 4 so the ceil will be 4 and the floor will be 3.
The math.ceil function will then work as you expect: math.ceil(1.0/5) = 1.0.
You are correct as is described in the [docs for ceil (hyper-link)]:
The return value of ceil() is still of type float
float ceil ( float $value )
If you want to keep your ceil or rounding you can call these first and then cast it as below:
It also uses Math.round() if you are worried about Math.ceil() and Math.floor().

Or 4.000000016, so ceil gives 5 (I did not check real value).
For this task you can calculate root (using ** or Math.Pow), and check the difference with floor-ed and ceil-ed values.
(To round up in MySQL use CEIL)
A query like this will ceil the timestamp value for all rows
EDIT: The N * ceil(lg(N)) part describes the space requirements for the alphabet order (assuming the alphabet itself is known).
Each position can thus be represented by three bits (ceil(lg(6)) == 3, three bits being sufficient for 0..7).
This has 18 bits, or 6 * ceil(lg(6)).
You could use ceil on the absolute value of the array to round each entry up to the next highest integer and then multiply by the sign of your data to apply the correct sign to the result.
