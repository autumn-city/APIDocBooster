,"When working with 1D signals, pyTorch actually expects a 2D tensors: the first dimension is the ""mini-batch"" dimension.",BatchNorm1d needs 2d input?,<machine-learning><deep-learning><pytorch>,www.stackoverflow.com/questions/55320883,"I want to fix problem in PyTorch.
I wrote the following code that is learning sine functions as tutorial.
[code snippet]
Training is done without error, But the next line caused an error, ""expected 2D or 3D input (got 1D input)""
[code snippet]
This error doesn't occur if it is without BatchNorm1d().
I feel strange because the input is 1D.
How to fix it?
Thanks.
