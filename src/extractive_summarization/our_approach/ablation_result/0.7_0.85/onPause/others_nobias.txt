A dialog**, for example, may not cover the entire previous Activity, and this would be a time for onPause() to be called. 
In most Activities, you will find that you will need to put code in onResume() and onPause(). 
 And let's see what happens when config changes, how it affects the activity.  So, on configuration change, the Android first shuts down the activity by calling method in sequence, that is onPause, then onStop and then onDestroy. 
For instance, an activity can be visible but partially obscured by a dialog that has focus.  In that case, onPause() will be called, but not onStop(). When the dialog goes away, the activity's onResume() method will be called (but not onStart()).
 The implementation of onPause is very fast because the next activity is not resumed until this method returns.  And is either followed by onResume, if the activity returns back to the front, or onStop, if the activity is becoming invisible to the user.  This is how we implement this onPause callback method.
