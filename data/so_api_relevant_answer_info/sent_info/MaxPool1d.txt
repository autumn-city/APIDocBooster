The number of steps in the input to the MaxPool1D layer is smaller than the pool size.
It needs to be at least 4 steps to be used as input to the MaxPool1D(4) layer, so have a minimum size of [4,32].
You can use MaxPool1d in the same way:
You can simply apply MaxPool1d() to any size, and they will be (probably) automatically padded.
Conv1D/MaxPool1D: The convolution will take the embedding and will convolve them around a filter which in this case is an n X n X 1.
@RobinFrcd your answers are either different due to MaxPool1d or due to the different initialization procedure.
