[Augmented API documentation]:

API: This API is <LeakyRelu> in pytorch library.

[Function]: Applies the element-wise function: [function] or [function].

[Supplemental Information]: The LeakyRelu function resolves the problem of dying neurons found in other activation functions that can only produce positive numbers. With LeakyRelu, the activation function can produce output even when negative input is applied, preventing the cancellation of weight updates associated with negative activation. Unlike ReLU functions, LeakyRelu doesn't have zero output for negative inputs, but outputs a small fraction determined by the predefined hyperparameter, mitigating the issues of dead neurons.

[Parameter]: negative_slope (float) – Controls the angle of the negative slope (which is used for negative input values). Default: 1e-2; inplace (bool) – can optionally do the operation in-place. Default: False

[Supplemental Information]: The negative_slope in this case refers to the slope of the LeakyReLU's negative half, not necessarily indicating a negative slope. As a concise term for kwargs, "negative slope" and "positive slope" respectively describe the slopes of the linear splines covering the negative [-∞,0] and positive (0,∞] realms of the LeakyReLU's domain.

[Notes]: None

[Supplemental Information]: For the Onnxruntime, which supports LeakyRelu, it is only implemented for 32-bit float type, while in PyTorch code, you might have to convert to 32-bit float before using LeakyRely. The term "maintaining a state" with reference to LeakyReLU activation implies that the function would retain learnable information or "state", extending beyond individual samples. By adjusting the leak parameter through training, the activation function acquires a "state". The sigmoid activation layer could be replaced with LeakyRelu for improved model robustness, eliminating the constraint of having neuron states that do not interact.
