[Augmented API documentation]

[[Function]]: 
Add this transaction to the back stack. This means that the transaction will be remembered after it is committed, and will reverse its operation when later popped off the stack.

The addToBackStack("TAG") function followed by popBackStackImmediate("TAG") can always revert the condition of a fragment without any data in the UI right before the fragment is created or added to activity. The addToBackStack method can work with both the add() and replace() methods. When adding a fragment transaction to the back stack, upon pressing the back button, the fragment transaction is reversed rather than finishing your activity. To return to the previous fragment in the backStack, use the popBackStack() method - but make sure to first add this fragment to the stack using addToBackStack().

[[Parameter]]: 
name	String: An optional name for this back stack state, or null.

The 'name' parameter in addToBackStatck(name) is used to determine to which fragment you wish to pop the fragment back stack when calling popBackStack or popBackStackImmediate(name, flags). For example, if you have a fragment stack with named fragments: A, B, C, and D with A at the bottom. When you call popBackStack(B, XXX_EXCLUSIVE), your fragment back stack will be: A and B after the call. Failure to provide a name means you can't achieve this. However, it's crucial to know that the 'name' parameter used in addToBackStack(name) can't be used to retrieve the fragment by calling fragmentManager.findFragmentByTag(tag), as the 'tag' is different from the 'name'. 

[[Notes]]:
Calling addToBackStack before replacing the content with the output fragments will not change the behavior of the back button. Changes are only made after committing the operation. Therefore, methods like popBackStack() and popBackStackImmediatly() will fail to function correctly if you didn't add the fragment you want to pop to the backStack. Do ensure to make a call to addToBackStack() at the moment of making the transaction to add/replace your fragment.
