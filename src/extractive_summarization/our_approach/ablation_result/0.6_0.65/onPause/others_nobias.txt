 And let's see what happens when config changes, how it affects the activity.  So, on configuration change, the Android first shuts down the activity by calling method in sequence, that is onPause, then onStop and then onDestroy. 
 The implementation of onPause is very fast because the next activity is not resumed until this method returns.  And is either followed by onResume, if the activity returns back to the front, or onStop, if the activity is becoming invisible to the user.  This is how we implement this onPause callback method. 
On other hands, if some new Activity occurs and occupies the full screen so that your previously running activity is disappeared.  In this Case, your previously running activity is moved to Back Stack. Here, onPause() + onStop() are called.
 So let me just override other methods also.  OnStart and onResume... onPause... onStop... onRestart... and last, onDestroy. 
2- previous activity is completely covered by new activity: both onPause and onStop will be called
