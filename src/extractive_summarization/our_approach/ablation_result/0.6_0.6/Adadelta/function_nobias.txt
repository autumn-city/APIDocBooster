Adadelta is an adaptive learning rate method which uses exponentially decaying average of gradients. 
 If you have gone side-track just remember one thing we are going into so much hassle because normal gradient descent has its learning rate constant for the entire training phase... which is so LAME!  So the optimizers like AdaDelta have some techniques to vary the learning rate with every iteration that's it. 
It just multiplies the variable updates (see [the update op implementation (hyper-link)]). 
 This was made possible due to this rho hyperparameter.  It is also known as 'Decay Constant'.  Instead of writing it with this equation, I have written it separately because we will need delta theta in this equation.  So, this term over here is the learning rate calculated by AdaDelta. 
Use an adaptive gradient algorithm like Adam or Adadelta or RMSProp.
