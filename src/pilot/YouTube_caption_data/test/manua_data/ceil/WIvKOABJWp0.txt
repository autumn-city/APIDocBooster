If you're not familiar with Google Colab, it 
basically lets you run Python and other languages,  
if you get creative, in the cloud in a virtual 
machine that gives you access to a GPU, as well.  
So you can run python in Jupyter notebooks, 
again other environments if you get creative,  
and experience your code on potentially a 
more powerful machine than what your local  
instance would be. If you're running a Mac, this 
is particularly useful because you can use a GPU  
that's actually compatible with things like Keras 
and TensorFlow, whereas macs currently don't have  
NVIDIA GPUs and and probably won't in the future 
because they're going more their own internal  
direction with the new M1. Which is getting some 
support but, that's another topic so what I want  
to talk to you about in this video is, and this is 
going to be a quick video, is ColabPro, where you  
pay extra money, worth it in first quarter 2021, 
and I put the date in here because this changes  
rapidly with Colab, as google puts more and 
more features into this. So let's take a look!
Oh and if you could possibly like this video, that 
really helps with the YouTube algorithm, and if  
you want to see more of this kind of things please 
subscribe. So let's jump right into it, first of  
all is CoLabPro even available in your region? I 
have listed the regions here. So they've improved  
this a lot. It used to be just United States and 
Canada, which was unfortunate for the rest of the  
world. Most of the subscribers and people watching 
my channel seem to be first from the United States  
with India a very very close second, maybe even 
overtaking! Definitely go India!! So let's get in  
to the side by side comparison. I wrote a notebook 
here that you can compare the non-pro version  
versus the pro version and the difference is nine 
dollars a month. So I think it's very much worth  
the $9.99 (USD) a month that they're charging US 
dollars. I am a subscriber of this and have been  
really since it first came out. You can look at 
the notebook that I have here. I'll have it linked  
in the description to this video so you can take 
a look and see where I actually got the data from.  
Let's look at the data a little more friendly of 
a format. Here you can see the two really side by  
side CoLab standard and Pro. They both have the 
same CPU on it it's a 2.2 GHz. Now this is Xenon,  
so these tend to not be as super fast because 
their data center. Heat is everything there. Both  
have two cores but the GPU that you get on these, 
now if you're watching this video in the future,  
this changes. I remember when this used 
to be primarily K80 on standard now  
we see a lot more T4s. I have not seen a k80 in a 
while and that's great because the T4s are faster.  
Collab Pro, what I'm currently seeing in first 
quarter of 2021, is usually I get a V100 sometimes  
I get a P100. I'm not really sure how this works 
in terms of when you get what. Like say for  
example I train GANs for a couple of days. Are 
they going to punish me and give me p100s in in  
the future? I don't know exactly how. GPU memory 
you're going to have 16 on the T4 so both of these  
are right at about 16 gigabytes and 12 on the L80 
this is really the sweet spot of what you want for  
space on your actual GPU. You can do a lot with 
this and if you're running, if you're hitting the  
ceiling adjust your batch size that's usually the 
best way to deal with this. System RAM is quite  
different. Now you have to request the system 
ram in the Colab Pro environment or you won't  
you won't get it and don't just request it for the 
heck of it. They detect if you're using their GPU  
or if you're using your system RAM or not and they 
they warn you about it and say hey you're you're  
being wasteful so you want very much to make sure 
that you're using that efficiently is in theory  
the the google AI watchers might might throttle 
you. This is important the virtual machine  
lifespan 12 hours on standard and I routinely run 
these full 24 hours now you have to do something  
so that they don't actually toss you out because 
they think you're no longer interacting with the  
system and we'll see that in just a second, but 
for me the the V100 alone cinches this that it's  
it's worth it if you're going to be training GANs 
and my next video is going to be on training GANs  
on Colab, so definitely take take a look 
at that. Subscribe so you don't miss it,  
and this little bit of code here I'll put 
this in the description. You can find this  
all over reddit and StackOverflow, but this 
basically shows you this is JavaScript that you  
put right in to the console. I'll show you that 
in a moment and you it's not going to time out  
on you it will hit that 24-hour thing and it'll 
it'll knock you off, but that is just the way that  
works. When you do hit that ceiling, you're going 
to see something like this. And you can also see  
all this stuff going on here a lot of the yellow 
is just the normal vomit that JavaScript throws  
at you while it's running. I have never 
seen JavaScript on a website not just throw  
all kinds of warnings, it's it's JavaScript, it's 
the cockroach that survived the language wars of  
the web. But JavaScript is great the web has ran 
on it but what you'll see here is these connect  
push that's my that's my script basically running 
and keeping this thing active ultimately when you  
hit the 24 hours you will see this or if you hit 
the 12 hours. If you're not paying for Colab Pro,  
this is a great product as well on Pro or Non-Pro 
and I'll do a little benchmarking between the two,  
because I'm doing a video soon on how to 
train GANs on these and I do want to show you  
the this tremendous speed boost that you get for 
that v100 that NVIDIA has and Google... if you  
ever want to add A100s to this this, this would 
be great I'm sure they will at some point but  
I have no idea when that will when that will 
happen, and then a few of the restrictions  
just to mention on this. The biggest one is you 
cannot sublet. So you can't go in on this with  
your friend and both of you share it, uh kind of 
like Netflix. And all of these ,it's it's hard  
for them to police that. But probably don't do 
that so basically the first the first three of  
these almost are all, so basically these can 
be summarized as don't mine cryptocurrency,  
don't use it to distribute software, and don't 
share your account with other people. Now,  
I will say some of the limitations that I find 
with this. First of all the 24 hour thing is just  
a pain to me, I have to restart that manually. 
I'll show you how you can deal with that in  
the next video on how to train StyleGAN on this. 
For a business situation, or for some of the the  
research projects that I've worked on, that I just 
I just don't want to deal with that, I'll buy my  
own GPU and deal with it or I'll run it in the 
cloud. Now in the cloud this is very similar to  
what you have to deal with around spot instances 
in Amazon, which can let you get basically a 70%  
discount on this. If you if you want to see 
a video on spot instances definitely tell me,  
I'd be glad to to do that and by the way, no you 
can't earn a profit on cryptocurrency with spot,  
and the day that you could earn a profit on 
cryptocurrency with AWS would be the day that  
AWS basically gets DDOSed into the ground by by 
Cryptominers. Other limitation that I will say  
and again this gets to research and some of the 
business projects that I work on, you are at the  
whim of google in terms of what software 
is installed. So, you if you want to run  
software that Google doesn't have, you have 
to uninstall others and reinstall and it's  
just hard to have reproducible research in Colab, 
because if you can't just capture a Docker image  
or a requirements.txt or something like that 
and truly capture what your what your code  
was running. So that's that's definitely another 
complaint that I have also you've whatever machine  
is running this you've got to have that machine up 
and running because if you just close your laptop  
it's gonna it's gonna time out if you're going to 
take your laptop and go from home to StarBucks,  
one day COVID will be over and I can do that again 
but you will you're gonna lose your connection,  
whereas if you're running this in the cloud or 
at home I can remote connect into my machine  
or I can run it on the cloud. So it's not 
as professional as what you're going to see  
using the cloud or using your own GPU, but 
to get started you you just can't beat this,  
and I have advanced GPUs and I use the I 
use the cloud and I still make use of Colab  
because for quick POC this is great and I 
don't necessarily want to interrupt my my  
home GPU from whatever it's currently working on. 
So, if you're not familiar with Jupiter notebooks  
this this is what Colab actually 
looks like, and just to see  
how I train GANs in it. I'll put a more finalized 
version of it but this is basically what I what  
I do to give you an idea of how I deal with the 
timeouts and things like that I mount my GDrive  
and this is the only control that they give you as 
far as what versions of things that you're running  
and I'm not even using TensorFlow, so I don't even 
know why I have this here. This is actually using  
PyTorch, but you mount your GDrive and then I 
am basically going to install whatever I want  
to run in this case it's StyleGAN ADA PyTorch 
and then I'm going to run these commands,  
because basically, I want to run actual python .py 
files not Jupyter notebooks, so I will run this  
in this case I'm converting images and you you 
basically run all your commands like this you get  
the output saved here. But the important thing is 
I am using my GDrive to do all the check pointing  
and storing my intermediate forms of this that 
way when inevitably this thing shuts me down.  
Which you can see here here is training training 
training moving happily along notice we're at like  
20 hours here and then bam it's dead. Here was my 
last checkpoint so that saved it to my GDrive and  
I can go retrieve the pickle file and continue so 
long as your software is designed to do that and  
then these ticks that continued they were wasted 
because they were ran on Colab but they were never  
checkpointed it didn't it didn't get it so this 
is a issue with setting your your checkpoint size.  
Thank you for watching this video and if you found 
this interesting you want to see more about CoLab,  
I use it extensively in my YouTube videos 
because I want to make sure everything that  
I put out there is compatible with CoLab because 
pretty much everything I do uses an NVIDIA GPU  
and this is a way. If you don't have that 
kind of processing power on your actual  
computer to be able to make use of what 
I put on the channel so please subscribe  
to my channel and think about giving 
this video a like thank you very much.
