Going to show you how you can do
language translation in three lines of
python code. Using this code
you can take a statement and convert it
from one language to another and you can
specify which language you want to
convert it
in. You obviously need to have python
installed on your computer
after it is installed you install Google
trans module so yes we are using Google
trans
python module for doing this translation.
You can just copy,
if you click on this icon you can just
copy this text
put it in your git bash cell okay?
And it should work now the current
version of Google trans is having an
issue so that's why I'm using some alpha
version
so as of December 2020
this is the version I will install so
when you hit enter it will
install the Python module
after that you can go to your Python
code here.
I have my pycharm community editor open
I am in a zen mode so let me
exit the zen mode. So this is how my
Python editor looks like. I have
created a new file here
and then I will go to again my
meditation mode
and just import the module so you will
save from
Google transport
translator
and then this is just a class so you
will create an instance of that class
and then you will say translate and in
here
you specify the statement that you want
to translate and then
your destination will be the language in
which you want to get it translated. So
what we're going to do now
is open Google translate here
and then let's say I want to transfer
power
in hindi language so in hindi language
is called kya haal hai?
so now I want to translate this back
into English
so here I will say this so see this is a
Hindi statement I want to translate it
into English by default the destination
language is
English but let's say you want to
translate in different language you can
specify it
and you will be able to find all the
language codes here
on the Google translate API
documentation so on this
pipe page if you click on API
documentation
you can come here and here you will see
that
the code for English is EN you see this
EN. EN is the code for english so I will
say EN
and then this will be my output and I
will be
printing my output that's it just
this three lines and you are done
so now I run it
and see it is translating it.
done! three lines of code amazing if you
want to just get the translated text you
can just print the text here
and that should work see how are you. You
can also
translate multi-line statement so here
this statements I have in english three
lines of statement this is about baby
yoda by the way
you must be liking baby yoda from
Mandalorian
and you are translating that into now
Hindi language so let's see how this
works so when you
see tell me who doesn't like Baby Yoda
but yeah
Baby Yoda has shaken me like soda. I love
Baby Yoda let me play one
clip of Baby Yoda please stay here only
few seconds
Baby Yoda
Baby
do you want to learn Python?
I'm not sure who doesn't like this cute
baby yoda by the way
you can read up more about the API by
clicking on API documentation link so
you get
all of this API information you can
translate
statements from one language to another
you can do things like bulk translation
see API usage language detection and so
on
by default they allow up to 15 000
characters the single text and they
would have some limitation if you are
trying to use it for a bigger
bigger purpose then you want you know.
this API will be limited
this code can be used into your main
software application.
If you have a mobile application let's
say which you design for
users in multiple regions and if you
want to do
translation this Google trans is a
perfect python module that you can use
you know how easy this is just three
lines of code.
