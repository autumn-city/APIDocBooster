The database is not opened when the database helper object itself is created. 
When changing the table schema in code (onCreate()), you should make sure the database is updated. 
For development time schema upgrades where data loss is not an issue, you can just use execSQL("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS <tablename>") in to remove your existing tables and call onCreate() to recreate the database. 
(OnCreate() is not executed when the database already exists)
