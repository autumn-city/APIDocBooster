So to feed your input of size (16,100) , you have
to reshape your input as convtranspose2d requires 4 dimensional input
(batch_size , height , width , channel).
Now when you feed the input in convtranspose2d is will have argument
of input_shape parameter as (16,100,1) and automatically add batch
size axis to the input which will make it 4 dimensional , now the
shape is (b,16,100,1).
The formula to calculate ConvTranspose2d output sizes is mentioned on the [documentation (hyper-link)] page:
