SAMUEL STOW: Hi.
I'm Sam.
I'm a developer relations
engineer with Google AdMob.
And today, I'm going
to show you how
to integrate the
Google Mobile Ads
SDK into your Android project.
First, I'll show you some of
the benefits of using AdMob,
so let's dive in.
So AdMob is probably the easiest
way to monetize your app.
It has four ad
formats, including
banner ads, interstitial ads,
native ads, and rewarded ads.
It also has advanced
mediation support
to help you maximize ad revenue
using multiple ad networks.
So we offer four
rich ad formats.
Interstitial ads are a
great looking full-screen ad
that you can present
to your users.
Banner ads are an easy
and flexible format
that will fit in
anywhere in your UI
and are an easy
way to get started.
Rewarded ads provide a simple
API for rewarding users
after viewing one of
your ads, and native ads
allow you to customize
the look and feel
of the ad to blend
seamlessly into your app.
But before your app
makes tons of money,
you're going to need
to include the SDK.
So integrating the SDK
into your Android project
has three simple steps.
First, we add the dependency
to your build.gradle file.
Secondly, we need to add
the AdMob app ID metadata
to your Android manifest.
And then third, we need to
initialize the SDK in your app.
So let's jump into a demo.
So here, I have a
simple Android app,
and I'm in my build.gradle
file for the app.
The first thing I'm going
to do is jump across
to the developer documentation.
And under Import the Mobile
Ads SDK in the getting started
guide, I'm going to
scroll down to the example
app-level build.gradle, and I'm
going to copy this dependency.
And it's important,
when you're integrating,
to use the latest version,
which we include here.
So now, we're going to
go back in and drop that
into our dependencies
and sync gradle.
Next, we're going to jump
across to our manifest,
and in here we're going to
put the metadata that we need.
So again, the easiest
way to get this
is to jump back across to
the developer documentation
under Update your
Android Manifest,
and we're going to copy
this metadata text here.
And we want to put that in
between the application tags.
And you'll notice that you need
to fill in your AdMob app ID,
and you can get this
from your AdMob account.
Finally, we need to
initialize the SDK.
So here, in the onCreate
of our initial activity,
we just type
MobileAds.initialize,
and you'll notice we
can parse a context,
and then there's a
completion listener.
So if you're using
mediation, you'll
want to wait for the listener
callback before loading an ad.
But if you're not, it's
OK to parse null or empty
for the listener.
So the next step
is to load an ad,
and that depends on what ad
format you want to display,
so we have numerous
links in the description
below for additional resources.
We have the developer
guides for each format,
as well as the developer
forum where you can go and ask
technical questions,
and the GitHub samples
which provide a standard
implementation for each format
for you to follow.
That's everything.
So today we saw how easy
it is to start making money
by serving ads in your app.
We also covered resources
in case you get stuck.

And thanks.
