 So where onCreate is called when the activity is first created, onPause it's going to be called when you leave the activity. 
whenever a new ACTIVITY starts the previous activity's onPause will be defiantly called in any circumstances. 
onPause()- Screen is partially covered by other new activity. 
onPause() + onStop()- Screen is fully covered by other new activity. 
Being in the foreground means that the activity has input focus.
