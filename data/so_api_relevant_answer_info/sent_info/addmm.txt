The call to addmm in Lua code directs to this function([https://github.com/torch/torch7/blob/master/TensorMath.lua#L487-L510 (hyper-link)]) and this in turn calls the addmm function defined in the C Torch Library defined here([https://github.com/torch/torch7/blob/master/lib/TH/generic/THTensorMath.c#L1282 (hyper-link)]).
The addmm function is an optimized version of the equation beta*mat + alpha*(mat1 @ mat2).
If beta=1, alpha=1, then the execution of both the statements (addmm and manual) is approximately the same (addmm is just a little faster), regardless of the matrices size.
If beta and alpha are not 1, then addmm is two times faster than the manual execution for smaller matrices (with total elements in order of 105).
RuntimeError: Tensor for 'out' is on CPU, Tensor for argument #1 'self' is on CPU, but expected them to be on GPU (while checking arguments for addmm)
