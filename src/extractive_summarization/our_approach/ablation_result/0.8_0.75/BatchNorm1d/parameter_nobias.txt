As per the documentation we need to specify num_features parameter which is the input size of tensor. 
Batch normalization works when batch size is greater than 1, so an input of shape (1, 32) won't work. 
In most cases you should be safe with the default setting. 
It takes input of shape (N, *, I) and returns (N, *, O), where I stands for input dimension and O for output dim and * are any dimensions between.
