all right so welcome back again my name
is jesse and in this wonderful and
exciting tutorial we're trying to see
how to
visualize a neural network so in case
you are doing any deep learning tests
and then you want to be able to
visualize your neural network we're
trying to see all the various methods we
can use to visualize your neural network
so some of the things you're trying to
do is that you're trying to get the
architecture of a neural network like
this right so there are different
formats of
neural network architectures we have the
perceptron feed forward and arrest so
how do you visualize what you have
filled so we're trying to check them out
so i'll go back again to call up
and then you just go straight away to
the methods so there are several methods
but you'll be trying to see how to work
with tensorflow
enn visualizer neutron and then tesla
board so let's go back and see so we
have going to load our idea packages
right and then also load our machine
learning packages at this
circuit line and then also for the for
building a
deep net deep learning new nature could
be using tensorflow right
okay so let's go back again so these are
the data which is taken from
my from my github repository and i'm
just reading it directly here right
so this is the iris is just a just
trying to use the iris for the bases
then you can use any one you want
so we're just going to encode these ones
because these are categorical i'm going
to encode them
as
numbers right so we're going to use this
muscle option and then we have already
encoded the entire stuff so we need to
specify our features and then our labels
which we have already done then later on
display our data set and then now we
have the most important thing that the
number of input features and the output
because as we said learnt earlier on
some time ago
every model
yep has this option right it's having
the input layer right which is the
number of features or the number of
features plus one to compensate for
buyers
and then you have the heading layers
right which we use this particular
formula to get it right but you can
create any one you want and for the
output layer is always
the target right so the most target
and if it's regression is one if it's
classification or binary that's one or
more based on the activation fashion
you're using so let's see how to do
something like this so i'll just go back
again
and then we have already specified the
input and the output right purpose so
let's build our model so in this case
we're trying to build a model so let me
take off this
come back here
and then we will just create a simple
file to
describe the modular button
build and url
next week
so that's what they're trying to do here
so you already know the formula
so i come back again i don't know what i
can see i hope everybody can see too i
hope it's not too small let me make it
bigger little yeah hope everybody can
see it well
okay
now so let's see how to work on it so
we're going to just
define a model sequential model and then
we are just specifying the first layer
right an activation function of
rectified linear unit
and then these things are constant right
we just want to show the concept of
visualizing it the input shape is the
number of
features which we have as
four right through you have to make sure
that you're just in this particular
format and this comma here is important
because that is a tuple right it
requires a tuple
then the softmax
this is going to be the output which is
the number here we have
except petosis
vaginica and then the restaurant so just
three that's where your specificity and
now you're going to build and compare
the model
pivot now how do you visualize so what
is the first step before we fit how we
can get the summary of the model so
let's get the summary
it's going to be my model that update
dot sum
so this is going to tell me about the
model that we have built and then
everything we need
pivot yeah you have not to train it yet
now in case i want to virtualize it how
do i do that before i
fit it to compile so i can just come
back again
and let's see the first method is going
to be method number one
one right so the number third one is
that we are using
plot
model from
tensorflow right
tf that's what you use that's the first
method right method number one so how do
you do that so it's very simple just
going to do it
from
tensorflow
dot keras
go to details
import
plot
mode right so that's what you're using
here isn't a particular one and this one
takes this option to
to visualize
let's go with plot model
right and as you can see from here it's
taking the model right the mode that you
have the neural network model and in the
file and in the shape right so i can
just copy this one here
to save us time
so come back here
so we're going to take the model right
the model that we have we take the file
so you can give it any name so let's put
this let's say iris go back here
iris model right dot png and then i'm
specifying the show shapes to it i'll
just plot the first one
and then you see the
result so the shapes
is that in that you're going to tell
this particular packet that don't show
me the shapes right
so this is going to be the first one to
run it like this it's going to
virtualize this particular model very
nice so this is the one without the
shapes right so it's going to tell us
the input layer right it's going to tell
us the
analysis the hidden layer stands layout
this layer one
two and then
the
rest right now i can also come back
again and do the same thing
that i did so this time i'm visualizing
with
showing the notes
right so it's going to be
this should
specify this one that's true i run it
again
and i'm going to see that's going to
give us more details right
so you can see the first layer
right the input and then the output the
dense layer dense one there's two and
then the output this is the output layer
right very simple so this is one of the
first method of trying to visualize your
neural network very simple right it's
going to give you a very nice fluid
chart apart from this there's also
another way of virtualizing it through
so this is going to be method one let's
check the next one we're going to be
method number two
this is going to be meter two
two so method two we are using the
a n visualizer
right so i don't know whether it has
been updated but let's try that as an
opportunity so in case you don't have it
i can just tell you this so pick install
enn versus
who's able to find it
yeah it's able to download it right
so this is another way we can actually
visualize our
model
so let's take out this
okay
okay so that's finished so i want to put
this one here
so that we know what you are doing this
method two
so we have we are done with that right
now how do you work with it this is also
very simple this also follows the plot
model approach so to visualize potential
light
i'm going to give it my note importer to
import
a n visualizer or simply go with this
option so
from
a n
which will like that
right
go to this
and visualize import our enn
base right so there's a package using to
help us visualize it let's see what this
one has to offer us
so it's going to be bring it up
my enn
this right and then from here i'm going
to pass in the parameters so it's going
to take the model
then the file name right and then the
title so this is something very basic
right just like the previous one by
passing my model
and also passing the file name we can
just give this title straight away
without giving the file name right so
let's give it my file name so file name
let's go that's my
let's say iris
model
two right
let's go to iris
and then model
dots as you can see it's going to be g
graphics to graph this right i think
it's z i'm not sure let's go back again
and check it out
yeah grab this right
you can also give the title so let's
give a title
which in this case is going to be
as you can see grab this and then the
title right so i'm going to give it as
my title to iris
neural network right
something like that right so this is a
very simple
package to help us with that but seeing
this one work with graphics you have to
also import graphical graph
this
input
or just go to tutorial with this
important this
yeah
perfect right so i'll now run it like
this and as you can see the minute i run
this one if i go back and i check here
this place is empty right with only this
particular image there which was coming
from the previous one so if i go back
and i click on this one here
it's going to create a folder it's
giving us an error but let's face it
so layer that's layer not supported for
visualization so let's try and fix it up
so that's one of the arrows right that's
one of the arrows that you will be
having to try and face it out don't
worry about it
okay it's not working right so the
reason this one is not working is that i
think because of the update of the api
for test flow
but that is how to do that right
apologies for that that is how to do
that so just use this option right that
is
option number two right and after
visualizing this you can actually see it
right it's going to generate a file so
it's going to view show you the clothes
right
very simple and very nice
you can also after that you can just go
back again and then use and also get the
file that has been created with cloud
file and then you can just get that file
by going just say my graph
file right so it's going to be my
graphics
in case it was able to generate
then from
file
graphics.source
dot
from file right then you pass in the
particular file there this is iris
and then
model
dot g
right that is how to process it so this
is going to give you the option and now
you can just go back again and then you
can just plot it into the graph
file right that is how to do that this
is a method number two
let's move on from this to
methodometrics i'm going to fit the
model to train
very fast because it's simple and i'm
going to evaluate it
and then let's check with the accuracy
of this particular model
this is
like
98 percent i think that's very very
powerful it's very good right because
it's iris that's it now the next thing
that for for you to try the next method
you are going to save it with h5 can
save it in different format but let's
see if it does h5
and after saving it is going to come
back we come back to our folder here
and you can see that that's just come
i'm just going to download it to
download it here
it's going to download it perfectly for
us perfect
now let's see
the next method so this is downloaded
method for visualizing is that you're
going to disappear meter number three
method three right so in meter three we
are using
neutron right to help us with the so
neutron comes in two formats we have the
software right the app itself and we
have the
browser
or online version so online
we have the offline
all right so let's see how to look at
this view to install it just because you
tell you this option for the
app
install it with this so pip
install
net run
or in case you're on windows or any so
any opening step i'll just give it a
passcode stamp so in case i'm in
windows or ubuntu snap
install
network right in case you're also on
macintosh to brew
install
electron right because it's both around
this is for macintosh
so this is for macintosh
and this is for
blindness
so you can use any of them to install
this is basic python right
that's how to install it on the system
so we have two options so let's first of
all try with the first one so i'm just
going to go back again
and then i'm going to install it so i'm
not going to install it i'm just going
to go back
to my system which i've already done so
this is my system here and then i'm just
going to go with snap
install
electron and that is my system right so
i need to use sudo to install it
so it's going to ask me this particular
question
it's i've already installed it right
okay so to start it just go with neutron
and then you can now work on it so this
is the first option
is a third option rather
it's opening previously for us on my
system
this is how it is right now when it
opens you can now open a module so i
just go back to this and open a model
it's going to lead me to a place that i
can pick a model so we already created a
model from here
we have this particular model here right
iris data set i'm going to paste it so
there is support server format so this
is it right so it has given us
a model
which is almost the same thing as we saw
here with the plot model
the same thing here right almost the
same thing
very nice it's the same thing you're
seeing with
the neutron right as you can see
you can make it bigger right and once
that as i click on this is going to be
the input layer it's going to give us
the node properties and the various
things there right if i click on this
one
if i click on the dense layer so this is
going to be the dense layer the
tensorflow locators the model type and
the various parameters right the various
activation parameters for each and every
one of them the same thing for direct
relu so it's very very important and
exciting right giving you all the
various attributes and then the node
properties and this is going to be the
dense layer right
very nice so that is the basic of using
neutron this is the app right now i can
change it in case i want to change this
one from this battle option to this a
different view this horizontal view
vertical view you go back here and i'll
specify that okay show it horizontally
so it's going to go in this particular
option
and you can expand it
and as i click on it it's going to show
the properties here right this is the
other method you can also do that right
very simple the other way is just go
back to your browser
and then enter nudge
run up right
so this is the next one so netron up
this particular one
that is an other alternative for
visualizing your new one so you have
seen the other option which is the same
thing here open
and then just pass in our model
the password is going to load this is
the option number four
still using electron right and you can
see it from here i can also change the
view
by going to show horizontal
and i can also
make it bigger
click on it
and we get our result
this is option number four right very
simple so i've seen this one plus model
we have seen
enn virtualizer which is now working at
the moment
and then we have seen how to use neutron
as a standard up using this particular
object here and also to use
our inside the browser right
now let's see the last method so the
last is going to be the last method
so let me this is metal number three
come back here make it better
so the future generation can benefit
from
yeah
and now this is going to be metal number
four
so this
or five bit as we can call it
so
method four right it's using tensor
so tensorboard gives you a lot of cool
features right
so in case you don't have you can just
go back again to your system and you try
to just pip
install
tensor
board and then return somebody
requirement for tensorboard that
you first of all need a log file log
folder
we're going to store your logs we also
need a callback
callbacks function right that is a bit
understandable these are the business
things that we need right
so i'll go back again
and then first of all i'm just going to
install it in case you don't have you
just
install
tensorboard
on your system i have it already so it's
going to tell me that's already there
perfect and then the next option is
after installing it you need to be able
to load
the extension so it reloaded today
present magic size to load
extension
then i'll just go with tessa
board
i'm just going to load it and activate
it for us
now let's create a folder
where i'm putting it if i go back and i
check here
there is no folder at this site right
so i just go back again
and i'm going to create my folder so
let's just log folder
transport folder would you specify that
this is going to be my logs right
perfect that is it second option the
next one is the callback so this is
going to be our callback
right it's going to be from
from sensor flow
but keras
but
callbacks right you have callbacks here
then i'm going to import
tensorboard
right
then after that i have to specify my
callbacks so specify
specify callbacks
with my callbacks
it's going to be
my tensorboard
and i'm passing my parameters so instead
of just taking all of these things so
they lost directory right
or the log directory
which in this case is going to be my log
file
or log folder right and then
it takes all of these other parameters
right so you can just put them there but
let's specify it as histogram
go to one right you can add the various
parameters if you want let's keep this
one as simple as we can
pivot now we have to connect
our callbacks
callbacks to
our model
right so we already have our model here
which was the one we had here let me go
back again
yeah this was the model
all right so i
yeah hope you're getting whatever i'm
doing right
so in case maybe the audio was off
so you have seen the first method we
have seen how to use the plots model
i've seen how to use the unvisualizer
that's how to use the net
app right
neutron app now let's see how to we are
trying to check on how to work with the
tensorboard right so we need to get our
model so i'm just going to copy this one
again
to recreate it i just come back again
to the 10 meter data board we have
specified our
logs we have created our callback
and then we need to be able to connect
our contacts to the model so i just go
back again then i'm going to specify the
callback so just going to my callback
callback is going to be my call box
right
that is it
so it's going to run it perfectly it's
not going to give us any result because
i've set variables at zero
then now in case i want to visualize the
entire stuff
to visualize the entire work right i
just go back again
and then use
the magic so let's come back here
sensor board
right that does log
directory
then i'll specify the lock folder so log
folder
right so if i run it like that it's
automatically going to use
my
it's going to launch it previously if
there's no error right
i'm going to open test tensorboard for
us within it so this is these are the
four main methods you can use to
visualize your any your neural network
right especially tensorflow neural
networks or keras neural networks
so by default as is that that's going to
create a folder
you're going to create the logs folder
as you can see here
it's coming it says it logs for the
inside that might look for them to have
my train
and tell my dreams going to have all the
various things that we need the plugins
the event all of these things so this
watch is going to be used to create and
generate this wonderful plot
and as you can see it's giving us a very
very nice representation of the entire
stuff the epoch accuracy over time
so i'm going to have the scalars
the graphs the distribution and the
histogram right and then the rest so
this is how to visualize your stuff
right
very very cool and there's the epoch
loss as it goes over time
this is a very powerful plot very
powerful
dashboard from tensorflow right and so
check the graphs
and you can also download it right
back again
it's loading it and see that this is
giving out exactly the same graph that
we had
so if i click on this it's going to open
it so let me fit to screen
you can actually download this entire
stuff
let's see that's giving us the
attributes the number of controls the
dependencies
and all of these important information
right
that's for the graphs right so this is
going to give us the graph for the
entire staff we have a distribution for
the model
what time us is training itself
this is how it is this is a very
powerful service then i supposed to get
the histograms we specify it as only one
right very simple it's gonna give us
some very nice
plots
so this is one of the best right it's
even better than all the rest we have
done but this has given us a lot of
information
then the final one is the time time
series right which is going to be the
time it has been using over time
so that's the basic overview of this
so that is the basic overview of all
these ways right so we have seen all
different ways you can use to visualize
our
neural networks right so number one
we have seen how to use teta flow plot
model we have seen how to use a enun
visualizer which was not working as soon
as you work with neutron you've seen how
to work with tensorboard for neutron you
just use the app itself in which you
upload right or you can use the
browser option here
right so thank you for watching and see
you next session stay blessed bye
