Hi, and welcome to the
router, the official podcast
of the UQ computing society,
where we explore the human
side of tech. I'm your host,
Matt and we are back after
exams with a brand new episode.
Today we're having a chat to Kendrick Tan,
also known as @kendrick on slack.
He has worked in the blockchain space
for many years and currently works at DFX
in decentralized finance, where
he is the chief technical officer.
He's here to give us a 20 minute
rundown on blockchain, Ethereum,
decentralized finance,
and more as well as addressing some of
the concerns regarding the past present
and future of cryptocurrencies.
All right. Welcome Kendrick to
the show. How are you today?
I'm good. How are you?
Yeah. I'm all right. Um, before I begin,
it would be good if you could introduce
yourself to anyone who doesn't know
about you, who you are,
what's your background,
where you work that kind of thing.
Yeah, so I'm Kendrick.
So I graduated from QT and 2019
with a computer science degree. Uh,
the reason I got a computer science
degree because my mom wanted me to get a
degree and I was like, probably
quickest way to get Out of uni.
And so I got one. So after graduating,
I've been working full time in
the cryptocurrency space. Um,
I originally wanted to
get kind of FAANG job,
but after dipping my
toes in this ecosystem,
I decided there'll be such a pity if
I didn't kind of grab the opportunity,
to go in such an emerging field.
So since 2019 I've been working
with, uh, various companies, uh,
one of them being, uh,
the Ethereum foundation.
So I contracted with the Ethereum
foundation for about half a year.
And we did a lot of work
on zero knowledge proofs,
which is like basically moon
math of people like to call it,
but I was the one reading the papers and
applying the math rather than coming up
with the math. So that a very big
difference. Um, in that it was very fun.
Like I learned a lot about
the processes of how,
like these cryptographers came up,
came up to these conclusions and how
to actually use them and how, like,
it's really interesting how you can like
use these properties in, uh, in, in,
in if you're specifically, anyway,
I was in love with a couple of the layer
two scaling solutions and figuring,
which is like, uh,
products or applications or protocols
that are dedicated to create help
make your scales like higher, uh,
high TPS or higher
transactions, the second. Uh,
but eventually, um, during 2020, um,
I found out about DeFi and
the decentralized finance and
after dipping my toes into that, I decided
I wanted to go full time into that.
And so I worked for a company called UMA.
Unfortunately the time
zones didn't work out.
And so I left and now I'm
currently working at DFX,
which I'm also the CTO.
Oh, very nice. So, uh, you
kind of started working, um,
in Ethereum or generally, and then
moved into, uh, decentralized finance.
Yeah. Yes. So it was mostly, I was
interested in the cryptography space,
but then suddenly this wave
of innovation came from,
like on the finance side, I didn't
know anything about finance back then.
I was still at like a geek, uh,
like more like a technical guy,
but just the amount of like smart
people in the space kind of convinced
me that maybe I should check
it out. And the minute I did,
I was like there's no turning back. Yeah.
That sounds super fun.
Um, I guess to begin, um,
because personally, I don't know too
much about, uh, this area of work. Uh,
could you begin by trying
to give like a, I dunno,
explain like I'm five kind of
introduction to what theorem is,
how it differs from, you know,
Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, um,
and maybe also a bit of an intro into
what decentralized finance is. Yeah.
Yeah.
So Bitcoin at its very core is
just a ledger,
which all the participants in a network
will agree upon the state of the ledger.
Um, and in Bitcoin's case, there'll
be how much Bitcoin everyone owns.
So for example, uh, if this, like,
if it is like 10 participants
eventually, and let's say,
I'm sending you 10 Bitcoins,
eventually everyone,
like you will broadcast a signal telling
everyone in the network saying, Hey,
I sent you 10 Bitcoins,
eventually everyone's ledger.
What kind of agreed upon that?
I've sent, you 10 Bitcoins,
and so they'll deduct 10 Bitcoins
from my account and add the coins to
your account. So that's like
a very at its highest level,
there's like a more there's
like more complicated stuff,
such as peer to peer networking,
routing and consensus theory. But, um,
let's just ignore that focus
on like the, the core idea,
which is like a decentralized ledger,
which will form eventual consistency
or like a distributed database,
if you don't want to
put it that way. Okay.
So that's the current state A to state B.
I want to kind of emphasize that state
transition because it's very important in
Bitcoin's case it's very, uh,
very application specific.
It just tells you how many Bitcoins is
in transferred from A to B or like the,
the, the delta, or like the state of
how many Bitcoins you own. Ethereum
on the other hand can be seen
as like a hack of Bitcoin.
So instead of having a very rigid system,
a very rigid state transition
system state A to state B.
You any programmer can create
an arbitrary logic to kind of
indicate how the state transitions
should be from state to state.
So if I want to like say
deploy a new token on Ethereum,
and I'll basically create a new
token and deploy it onto the ledger,
like there's a good
database, where it stores,
like the byte code of your application.
And let's say state A
doesn't have the tokens.
Once you deploy the contract, State B
will state that, Hey, in this, in this,
uh, storage slot, I like to call it,
there is now a new token
with this bytecode and now
I can execute arbitrary code
against as,
or execute like some kind of a code on
Ethereum against that deployed by the
state to change more
states. So it's more like a,
a generalized state transition machine.
And also keep in mind that Ethereum,
runs in virtual machine, just like
the JVM, but they call it the EVM,
it's your emotion machine, which
is also occurring complete.
So now you have like
generalized s, so that's like
a complete state machine. Um,
and Bitcoin's like more like,
uh, application specific ones.
So, uh, in that sense I would,
that's what I like to call it like a
hackers Bitcoin. It's a lot more exciting,
uh, because you can build any, anything
you can dream of. Well, right now,
right now it's mainly finance. Um,
because if Ethereum and Bitcoin are
speculative assets. So, uh, like
the main applications built on.
And right now I financially
related, which brings us into DeFi.
Um, so DeFi is this movement from kind
of like the secret world the wall street
and like the centrally controlled,
like Mon like sovereign money
into this, like cyber punkish,
uh, like democratized, uh,
money platform, if you will,
which is which essentially what DeFi is.
I remember three years ago when
I started out in this space,
there wasn't a stable point,
um, when I started up,
but now there's like so many, so
many financial infrastructure,
it's impossible to keep up in the space.
I mean,
so there's so many like different words
that kind of get thrown around when it
comes to like cryptocurrency and this
sort of thing. So it's good to hear about,
um, a few of those things.
Are there any other kind of more
specialized things that you work in,
maybe give a brief intro into, you
mentioned zero-knowledge proofs before.
What is that like? Like what, what
is it like working in that space? Um,
I it's, it's a cryptographic thing, right.
So I guess is like a lot of math
involved, that kind of thing. Yeah.
Oh, keep in mind. I was the
one who was reading the papers.
Yeah. Yeah. That's all good.
Yeah. Yeah.
But essentially what I did my work
in the zero knowledge proof space is,
how do we, it was like a voting
system. It's like, how do I,
how do I vote for someone without
revealing my vote? And in fact,
if you're interested in it, I think, uh,
EY also released something to do with
like transacting on the blockchain with
zero knowledge proofs.
So how do I create a receipt to
accompany that I'm dealing, uh,
that I have like some kind of relationship
to kind of prove that I sent payment
without actually revealing the
payment, because keep in mind,
these payments are publicly,
uh, on a public ledger.
And if your competitor knows,
like who you're paying and how much
you're paying for what amount of like, uh,
supply and it's like kind of bad news,
because then they can kind of use this
information to their advantage. Um,
I forgot what it's called,
but if you look up EY zero knowledge
proofs ethereum it should come up.
Yeah, yeah. I will. I'll link that in,
in the description of the podcast. Um,
yeah, I'll find it. Yeah.
So essentially it's like,
how do I prove I have something without
necessarily revealing that particular
something, um,
is the whole idea of like so
much proves there's also like
other rabbit holes that you want to dive
deep into and it's consensus theory of
which I'm not, I'm not I'm, I
haven't touched, touched at all,
but there's also something called
MEV or minor extracted value. Um,
when I, when I mentioned
like the state transitions,
the all their state
transition can be exploited.
It's almost like an order on an
exchange like high-frequency exchange.
If you were to suddenly jump the
queue, you were like profit and loss.
And it's the same with like mine extract
value because mine is kind of dictate
the order of transactions that occur.
And how do you like game the system?
So what order of the state transition
costs will your maximum value is
quite a, quite a new field.
It's only come around in the
last four months or five months,
but it's slowly gaining momentum.
Huh. Sounds interesting. Um, yeah,
I'm new to all this stuff. Um,
I guess another question that people
ask, I think, um, when they hear about,
uh, Ethereum cryptocurrencies
and this kind of thing, um,
at least from what I've
heard, it's, it's kind of,
some people think of it as something
that you tried kind of treat it like a
stock or like a, you know, a currency
you're like just buying into it. Um,
and you just hope to see the
price rise when you buy, you know,
try to make some money off of it. Um,
but I guess some people like, like me,
I'm wondering, like there are some
of these benefits to, you know,
decentralization, um,
and I guess, you know,
getting rid of that,
no mysterious wall street hole that
the money seems to go into. Um,
but like what, what other, like, does
it solve any other kind of problems?
Like what, what other things can
you apply this theory of, um,
idea to, in terms of like technology.
That's definitely the main narrative.
So Bitcoin that's like a decentralized
store value. That's like not...
To answer your question,
sorry. That's one of the main,
that's one of the main
use case just recently,
because Bitcoin has been a
transfer of value, like a,
like a store value that can
electronically transfer,
like Bitcoin is money as a data structure,
which that concept is, in my opinion,
incredibly powerful. I
guess we don't really,
we don't really experience it here,
like in Australia because it's a lot
of that we have a stable political
system or currency is relatively strong.
There isn't much need to kind of call, um,
outside of like sovereign money.
But if you live in say Zimbabwe
or Venezuela or Turkey,
or recently Turkey where there's like
a dictatorship happening and, um,
there's like, it's political
instability, that's a real,
real need to have access these kinds
of instruments because you want
to be able to leave the country with
your wealth intact. Like it will be,
I mean, if you can escape the
country, but start from zero,
that wouldn't be ideal. Right. Um, yeah,
but to answer your question,
that's like the main use cases
and I can perceive certain
other use cases such as
voting, uh, on blockchain.
But that kind of brings
up a lot of, um, other,
um, potential issues with that. Yeah.
Yeah. Like I guess, um,
confidentiality and, you know,
making sure that your votes are
secret and I've heard about some, uh,
approaches to this kind of, um, you
know, making elections better, but,
um, it seems like the best way forward
is to keep developing this technology,
um, seeing if we can get around those
issues and it's better than at least it
sounds like there's more potential in
these blockchain approaches than the
current system of digital voting,
which is just some dodgy
windows XP machine in a,
in a booth that you just type your
votes into and hope that it, you know,
this is correct. And.
Yeah, because with voting,
like how do you guarantee
that the hardware you're
running is going to execute
what it says on the screen? We don't
even know that, like it's a lot,
a lot of issues about like from the
hardware level and and if the software is
perfect, how you,
you can't guarantee stuff in hardware
that was simply just too many
potential, uh, backdoors. Mm.
Um, I'm gonna pivot over to
something a little bit different. Uh,
so you're talking about,
I guess the use of
Bitcoin and crypto currency
in general, like it's,
it's kind of going up
and I've noticed, like,
there's been news stories
about how, like, you know,
in El Salvador and countries like
that with us starting to, you know,
accept Bitcoin as like legal tender. Um,
so Bitcoin is becoming more and more
popular and people are more and more
interested in, uh, possessing Bitcoin
mining Bitcoin, obtaining Bitcoin.
Um, and that's kind of led
to this discussion about
the environmental impacts of
cryptocurrencies, because
obviously currencies in general have
their own environmental impacts, you know,
generated by all this production of,
you know, minting and things like that.
But it's a bit unique and it's a bit
different because now it's kind of
intersecting with the tech world
a little bit and where, you know,
there's been this rise of
people purchasing GPU's to mine,
Bitcoin and, you know,
different methods of verifying ledgers
and things like that has led to the
increase of like computational
use of power. Um,
so I guess there's like a few, few
things been brought up about that.
Um, I guess,
could you give a bit of background from
your like cryptocurrency perspective
about what, what, what are
the issues about it? How,
what is the issues of Bitcoin or
cryptocurrency and in terms of that,
how is crypto trying
to tackle these issues?
Um, well, first of all,
I completely agree with your statement
that it's consuming too much electricity.
Um, however, I do, I would like to
point out that a lot of the, like,
like the criticisms surrounding the
electricity consumption by the media,
it's a little bit misguided
in some sense, um,
cause like Bitcoin and cryptocurrency
mining in general have this very,
a unique property, like their power.
They consume power in a very
geographically independent
manner. So we're used to consuming
power. That's kind of close to us.
So for example, Brisbane, we
used to pack consuming power.
That's kind of generated in Queensland.
It'd be absurd to think that we will
consume power generate in some way or
Singapore or somewhere in New Zealand
or somewhere in Iceland, China,
but that's exactly what a Bitcoin
story it's actually consuming
electricity in,
in areas that are kind of, uh,
in areas that have an
overabundance of power.
So for example, like the main, uh,
mining published in China and
Sichuan and Inner Mongolia far away
from the city center as well, um,
in Iceland where like the city,
like actually cryptocurrency,
mining consumes more electricity
than I think certain parts of
Iceland.
The point being that like these
electricity consumption is actually being
consumed and also keep
in mind that energy,
energy is really hard.
Like electricity in particular is
very hard and very expensive to store.
So the minute you produce it, it kind
of needs to be consumed immediately.
Otherwise it would be wasted
and electricity consumption
has to like kind of
go with like the peaks and troughs
of our consumption. So for example,
in the afternoon might
consume more electricity,
but like at night as
Bitcoin's like constant. Uh,
so I guess what I'm trying to articulate
is that a lot of the times like these
energy consumption by cryptocurrency
and Bitcoin mining in particular,
Bitcoin mining particular
would otherwise be
electricity, that's kind of wasted.
So you kind of monetize and, uh,
and, and kind of like a resource that
would otherwise go to waste. Um, however,
I do agree that there's
contributing to a lot of greenhouse
gases. Um, and, uh, there
are some ways kind of,
there are plans in
Ethereum, not for the coin,
the coin kind of staying on this whole
proof of work thing where you use like
computational resources to kind
of validate the block state.
Whereas if you're in this kind
of moving on to this, uh, this,
this system of calling it,
using the system called proof of
stake where you capital to verify,
um, the validate like the block state,
rather than using some sort of, uh,
some are they're using a computational
power, uh, which would in theory,
significantly reduce, uh,
the energy consumption.
So I guess there's, there's,
there's more approaches being developed
now to try to get around this issue,
I guess. That's good. Um, do, do
you think that as a result of this,
um,
people might move away from Bitcoin or
do you think that Bitcoin is kind of
going to have the same value,
same role that it has now.
Uh, it has past the litmus test,
um, too many times, uh, it's,
it's, it's going like a lot of times,
like these ledgers on like
these cryptocurrencies
are kind of like, instead of,
I kind of like a social consensus
amongst people, I like to think that,
um,
like there's now a social
consensus amongst all the
hedge funds and all like the
big finance finance companies that Bitcoin
is here to stay and they're kind of
looking more deeply into it.
And so I do not think that,
and Bitcoin has a dominant,
Bitcoin is the dominant
asset that's looked at as a stored value
kind of hedge against the recent, uh,
US supposedly US inflation.
So I do not think that
people particularly, uh,
I don't really think anyone
would really move away actually,
because of these energy
consumption issues.
It's good to keep in mind, you know, um,
the impacts of that kind of thing, and.
Yeah, yeah, totally agree that it
can be, can be better, but yeah,
you know, if you, I mean, nationally,
and also if you think that, uh,
Bitcoin as a settlement
layer is worth $0 then
naturally,
or it really depends on how much you
value Bitcoin as a settlement layer,
as you mentioned,
currencies creation and
minting of currency do generate
kind of like green and greenhouse
and contribute global warming.
So if you think that Bitcoin as the
settlement layer is $0 and naturally all
the energy, like no matter how much,
how middle energy consumes it still.
Is waste. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Um,
I didn't really have any
other questions to ask.
One thing I wanted to ask is if,
if some listen up someone
listening would like to find out
more about these kinds
of technologies, uh,
where do you think they should go?
Like, do you have any kind of resources,
things to read things to watch? I
don't know, um, recommendations.
Uh,
personally I found that creating a
Twitter account and following a key set of
thought leaders is probably the best way
to get forward because the information
just there's just too much information
out there. It's too sparse. No, one's,
it's no real, uh,
there's no centralized repository where
you can kind of go through and find out
what to do. Like it's just too much
happening every day. Like every day,
that's like a new concept,
opening protocol being released.
There's like a new paper
that you should read.
And so I would highly recommend creating
a Twitter account and following a few
key. He key influencers, if you will. Um,
that's like how I stay updated,
otherwise it's just impossible.
Yeah.
So it sounds a lot like ML has been for
the past few years where it's just a
constant stream of information and the
only way to keep up is Twitter or like
arXiv and just it's crazy.
Yeah. Yeah. Definitely some
similarities then. Yeah. Yeah.
All right. Um, that's it for me? Uh,
thanks so much for joining us on this, uh,
episode. Um,
I will make sure to link everything
that's been mentioned in the,
in the description and, uh, yeah.
Uh, thanks for coming along.
Well, thank you. Thanks
for having me. Thanks.
All right. That's all we have time for
today. Thanks for joining us as usual.
Our next episode will
be out in a fortnight,
but until then come join us on our
slack community at slack.uqcs.org.
