haris_pap: he's coding up a CPU simulation, right ?
NatelBeats: yessir
darkzade: new cam? PogChamp
spookyknockknock: but whatever... not judging python and CSS engineers today
pepeega: RISC means reduced instruction set; favoring fast, parallel simple instructions over slow powerful complex ones
morkeus1: @georgehotz have you looked at IOTA?
itskyledaniel: How can i donate ??
haris_pap: @pepeega So it's like x86 --> ARM --> RISC ?
Santiago_LHC: @itskyledaniel Go to the comma.ai store
Santiago_LHC: or subscribe
AOE_matt: Is this Assembly Code?
pepeega: ARM is a RISC instruction set, x86 is a CISC (the complex alternative)
haris_pap: thanks
PanTrakX: So RISC is the future?
PanTrakX: like what apple did with the M1?
donkeydonny: What is he making?

JigglyGirls: genetics
botasttv: @Zepcon7 i have the same question
darkzade: @oreo_171 if you consider IQ a valid measure of intelligence obviously yes
Santiago_LHC: @spookyknockknock it's a good friendly name
coolcake2: clearly the screen affective eye sight is a myth then
haris_pap: It's a pan from micrograd @spookyknockknock
botasttv: @coolcake2 it's not myth for sure
Pilakoutas03: yes this sample size of one is a good way to draw general conclusions
firebullmonkey: cheer500 .
pepeega: From my experience, screen can hurt eyes if you're not used to it, but your eyes will adapt
ahahaitslit: i googled it and literally the first result from harvard health page is saying it's a myth lol
pepeega: Billions of people stare at a screen 8 hours a day hehe
coolcake2: @coolcake2 i think you can treat it as a myth nowdays since we have quite good screens that do not put strain on your eyes
donkeydonny: @ahahaitslit what‚Äôs a myth?
karanberries: what's an elf file
random_user_name: how does RISC play into autograd?
haris_pap: Eye strain has to do with lightning.  If it's bad, your eyes get hurt.  That's still different from needing glasses tho
spookyknockknock: Many projects fail solely due to naming complexity/rithim
ahahaitslit: that staring at the screen all day is "bad for your eyes" according to harvard . health . edu
Santiago_LHC: depends which screen probably, and what's the context
ahahaitslit: yeah haven't read the details probably worth checking out
coolcake2: george uses dark mode this is why he doesnt need glasses
thenotorious009: what is risc v
surajt: someone link me a good vim tutorial please
pepeega: At the end of the day it's just light. No reason it should hurt your eyes
coolcake2: @thenotorious009 CPU architecture
haris_pap: The old (CRT) screens used to be pretty bad due to the photon gun they had to make the display work

Santiago_LHC: For when you want to make things
SurfCat: Having fun
random_user_name: @PrimeLogik mostly scripting
aleksjz: @PrimeLogik deep learning
spookyknockknock: C is actually easier than python
krad_1337: what dont you use python for? drivers?
oMYTHRA: @PrimeLogik Python is general purpose
pepeega: for scripting I guess; what it's designed for
KrypticNation: @PrimeLogik back end, data science and analytics
frode_0xa: You can use python for many things
PrimeLogik: thank for answers
haris_pap: you can make simple 2D games too with python
the_gilps: yoyo did you guys ever end up finishing pokemon red speed run? I had to dump out early
spacecadet5280: you guys remember when you thought to yourself "i'm getting pretty good at python!"  Then you watched this dam live stream and now you want to end your life?
PrimeLogik: Btw any c# developers here
pepeega: python is not the right language for making 2D games :)
spookyknockknock: Anyone who uses python machine learning does not understand what an array is lol
frode_0xa: LUL
KrypticNation: @PrimeLogik Python simplifies the coding so you can focus more on the delivery aspect rather than getting bogged down on syntax.  Although it comes with a performance price
Santiago_LHC: @pepeega "right" is subjective
haris_pap: I said you can make simple 2D games with python.  That's all
cottonxxx: what is twitchcore?
coolcake2: this stream is great. its like im studying, but im actually watching a stream
oreo_171: @spacecadet5280 truu, I feel like passing out seeing him code like that
SurfCat: Why not you can write modules in c for it pepeega Keepo
karanberries: do you guys know what paper he's loolking at
fieryscribe: @cottonxxx a RISC-V CPU core. that's his name for it
KrypticNation: @spookyknockknock that's not true at all
frode_0xa: Tits the riscv spec
luca2371: luca2371 subscribed with Prime.
frode_0xa: You can find it on the githubs
Santiago_LHC: @karanberries you can read the file name on screen
oMYTHRA: @KrypticNation that guy has to be a troll
surajt: you use python when you want to be slow at things
cottonxxx: @fieryscribe oh thanks
spookyknockknock: @KrypticNation I'm exaggerating but you get the point
coolcake2: i remember hearing about J type
karanberries: I see it now thanks
JAKWAI: https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/
aleksjz: @PrimeLogik I mean, Numpy and similar stuff makes this language one of the best for Math. (Of course there is Julia also)
pepeega: Im in HPC and we just use fortran, great for math too!
murraydrover: hey from glasgow george
dyjabeu: @JAKWAI thanks bro
murraydrover: what you doing
haris_pap: Julia's cool.  Doesn't have as good of support but it's faster than python.  Do you guys think Julia could be used a lot for ML in the future ?
tatted_Schnitzel: can someone answer what are we doing and what is the purpose of this?
PanTrakX: why you hit the k3yboard so hard ? xD
commandpaul: what's an efficient way to decode bitfields in python ?
KrypticNation: Anyone hear know Scala?
spookyknockknock: I'd say python and C is really all you need to do things fast.
aleksjz: @pepeega Well, hard to do ML in fortran.
spookyknockknock: Anything java related is crap
pepeega: I agree, julia is pretty amazing I think but without support, can't use it today
commandpaul: any struct union tagged union hacks ?
aleksjz: @KrypticNation Forget about it and use Elixir and Erlang
Landepbs: @georgehotz page 116 has all instructions, much more practical for decoding IMO
spookyknockknock: If you have dependency with jvm then you're an idiot
surajt: I use sublime... how long would it take me to completely switch to vim?
spookyknockknock: thx for allowing. That was borderline lol
pepeega: And sure, isn't for everything. In HPC we often combine math and ML inference. C++ is C compatible, C is fortran compatible, so works out lol
KrypticNation: @surajt lolol vim is going to be tough to pickup
vybster: @surajt why not just keep using sublime?
thisisnotatemp: Did anyone buy the command 2 at double price? @georgehotz
K0enich: just got here. are we writing an emulator?
Sm0keey: yooo hey there George! what we doin?
tatted_Schnitzel: why are we decoding instruction sets?
surajt: idk vim looks cool xD
JAKWAI: think about going for VSCode + Vim extension first
Santiago_LHC: @surajt Depends on how much you like vim, and how hard you try to adopt it. It's not an easy transition in general.
Kmynis: hex is very normal ppl numbers :D
SurfCat: Just use vim on the side as a text editor instead ide maybe.
spookyknockknock: @pepeega yeah C++ is very suitable for ML
bewdism: vim shortcuts will be a learning curve
aleksjz: @pepeega I mean for HPC maybe Python is bad. However, decent percentage of IT now rely on DS and ML. Hence  modern Python frameworks put this language on top above all.
surajt: ok thx
KrypticNation: @surajt it does lol I use it when I need to make small changes in a server but not exclusively to code.  An IDE will make your life easier
SurfCat: Some stuff you just want ide tools for yeah there's plugins but so much time and not always good.
vybster: @surajt fair enough, I'd probs try to make sublime look like vim then. Its so customizable, I'm sure there are ways to replicate the look
spookyknockknock: You can you believe the idiots at tesl@ they use pytorch. They're like the dumbest engineers in the world
aleksjz: @pepeega But for ML u want to make models fast. With C++ it is more expensive and time consuming.
surajt: SeemsGood
donkeydonny: @spookyknockknock what‚Äôs wrong with pytorch?
aleksjz: @pepeega I meant spent less time on coding, not producing fast running models.
commandpaul: it's at the end in a table
pepeega: @pepeega I wouldn't put apples on top of oranges but I like both!
Santiago_LHC: It's good to know the vim basics though. Sometimes you may be in a terminal which has nothing but vi. It's nice to quickly be able to jump in a file, do some edits and get out.
ahahaitslit: it's worth learning vim or emacs so you don't have to use the mouse lol
sur86: Can you please volume up the mic?
BlueSeamoose: Pokemon Red lookin good ohnCute
fulcrum_66: Do you work in remote for your company ?
aleksjz: @ahahaitslit U can do the same in VScode too.
spookyknockknock: The mod3l 3 has the worst parts I've seen... it's the unsafest thing on earth
Cracktune: yo yo yooo
ahahaitslit: oh ok cool
oMYTHRA: @Santiago_LHC yea good for doing quick edits to cofig files and stuff

oMYTHRA: @siriusb_79 a lot of ppl taking the bait too LUL
spookyknockknock: faster faster build crap
Morocco0: still working on the asic?
northumb: this guy really really motivates me
aleksjz: @spookyknockknock No, just 99% of engineers not geniuses, but usual people.
spookyknockknock: @donkeydonny you do not do machine learning when you don't have arrays
commandpaul: add upper immediate to pc
commandpaul: auipc
pepeega: @pepeega Sure, use python all the time for ML! But I mean that python can't fit in a HPC framework, which is fine; pytorch C++ interface etc.
donkeydonny: @spookyknockknock what do you use? Tensorflow?
MrBankster: this guy is such an inspiration
big_dog_genetics: shaved george looking like hes tryna sell me life insurance
granola__bar: hello there how is everyone doing?
ahahaitslit: good
spookyknockknock: @donkeydonny No do, it's just linear algebra... do your  own C library
Kmynis: hello. doing great
MrBankster: dandy
granola__bar: i am very new to coding lul when i see george code its like a superpower lol
big_dog_genetics: good morning tho programmers, let's get this bread
capataci: is he building a virtual cpu?
Morocco0: I have toothache..
commandpaul: the last 2 bits are 11 because they are rv32 32 bit instructions
aleksjz: @pepeega You have very cool libraries for Python like Numba, OpenMP support, SymPy. Which speedups ur program drastically.
granola__bar: he is a genius
aleksjz: @pepeega Also using Cython.
haris_pap: I think he is, yes @capataci
granola__bar: what is he doing?
granola__bar: lol
spookyknockknock: The concept of genius is also stupid
granola__bar: even the title i didnt understnad
maciejfiedler: kinda weird seeing low level stuff in python
haris_pap: coding up a virtual CPU
the_gilps: lol
SurfCat: So how do you test or run this while writing? Like what do you look for/read.
commandpaul: shift right logical imm
my_synthetic_dreams: this is my first time here. and Im already happ
my_synthetic_dreams: happy*
hiimximo: what is he doing?
coolcake2: if 2 and 2 add up to 4, your good
Pureelectricitys: This is a weird way to do a Pokemon Red speedrun
donkeydonny: @spookyknockknock I like to use some libraries other people made like pandas, matplotlib, SKL, seaborn, numpy, etc
Santiago_LHC: The next person asking what is he doing gets banned.
coolcake2: F
hiimximo: F
‰Ω†ÁöÑÁå´: nice
donkeydonny: F
oMYTHRA: oof
big_dog_genetics: python Da Vinci  in the lab cooking
spookyknockknock: @donkeydonny Why is your username is called donkey?
aleksjz: @pepeega Oh. Yeah. Numba is a great Python JIT compiler, which can make it faster that C++ in many cases.
rzibi_: oh, hi
the_gilps: what are we trying to accomplish?
coolcake2: lmao this guy paied repsects for humself
PanTrakX: @Santiago_LHC But how are the new viewers supposed to know what is he doing?
donkeydonny: @spookyknockknock I used to own a donkey haha
‰Ω†ÁöÑÁå´: @Santiago_LHC by reading the title and maybe googling the concept
aleksjz: @Santiago_LHC Read his title of stream.
Santiago_LHC: @Santiago_LHC by watching and paying attention, and trying to figure it out
granola__bar: lana_lux also streams she is also a mod here lul i was shocked after seeing that
frode_0xa: Its obvious what he is doing
frode_0xa: Just read the python
nytherino: hahaha
oreo_171: @PanTrakX does shroud stop every minute and explain why he is shooting the bad guys?
SurfCat: 4Head
l8nightt: Big brain here
coolcake2: ye like how do ppl not know what a RISC-V core is
karanberries: does it matter if he uses 64k or 32k mem?
haris_pap: I think you're biased to think that everyone can understand what he's doing just because you can
karanberries: the arm manual is trash
spookyknockknock: Take a computer arch course bro... you're wasting your valuable youth
granola__bar: @coolcake2 lol
pepeega: @pepeega Sure, but that can't replace everything. Lots of tools and even hardware that only works with specific software. In theory it's all so easy, in practice not.
dunstableramsay: awcPythonk
coolcake2: @karanberries dont get me started on ARM ARM
aleksjz: @coolcake2 Google and a bit of reading.
the_gilps: well it's clear what he's doing with the ISA, but it's not clear why?
esteve_11: What is he doing?
j0sheezy: Dude i learned this in INtro to CS, COMP 101... this is not advanced at all btw
aleksjz: @the_gilps For fun
big_dog_genetics: you know shit us real when its written in latex
BlueSeamoose: @georgehotz lanaluHuh lanaluHi2
granola__bar: why is he doing this though?
tirefire: there is switch in 3.10
Santiago_LHC: @haris_pap It's not a matter of understanding or not, it's a matter of asking dumb questions or not. Not understanding is not an excuse for asking dumb questions.
aleksjz: @big_dog_genetics Kappa Kappa Kappa Doing this every day,
commandpaul: auipc doesn't modify pc, it gets a of relative value
the_gilps: @the_gilps SeemsGood
dyjabeu: python enums are shit
awesomefreak72: Match is a switch in 3.10
tirefire: @georgehotz they added switch in python, call it match
haris_pap: I think he's exploring this architecture to make new CPUs for training @granola__bar
redskinxx: @georgehotz not sure if you heard but they're adding switch statements to python soon
spookyknockknock: "no switch statement" exactly! dude just do it in C...
frode_0xa: Because he wants to program an fpga with the riscv ISA as an accelrator for tinygrad
my_synthetic_dreams: @granola__bar for fun bro
dunstableramsay: is he hacking the Gibson?
frode_0xa: And he wants to learn how it owrks
frode_0xa: works
BaianoDelas: jaaaaaaaaaaal
pepeega: Chat wanted python, now complaining it's p
the_gilps: @frode_0xa PogChamp
darkzade: @spookyknockknock you new?
sharkonet: JAAAL PogChamp
big_dog_genetics: is there anything better than python tho
dedhuecilisvinec: nabeel day?
donkeydonny: PogChamp
the_gilps: hahahahaha
Muzyd: gottem
coolcake2: SeemsGood
qq818: based
granola__bar: lol he is so focused for something that he is doing for fun lol
Kmynis: +1
my_synthetic_dreams: @spookyknockknock python 3.10 added support for cases. kinda like switch
crakeenn: crakeenn subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 1 month streak! hi!
thedumbdoc: thedumbdoc subscribed with Prime.
the_gilps: legend

Santiago_LHC: But FORBES bro, time sensitive...
coolcake2: 10 POINTS to GRIFFINDOR
zaubages: I'm leaving the university, some page or book that recommends me about CS or IDK something about this
sur86: yo yo
the_gilps: the one universal truth
karanberries: JAL is jump and link right
pepeega: We're just if statements
granola__bar: do you like granola bars?
dunstableramsay: awcKeebL awcKeebR
Kmynis: hhkb piano
granola__bar: you can eat me
the_gilps: haha
sanneck: @Muaaath and elses
karanberries: when did Forbes have standards
MrBankster: racism is bad mmmkay
dunstableramsay: bold take on racism
the_gilps: lol mmkay
hardtarget4: YOUUUUUUUUU
big_dog_genetics: hating on journalists is big dog plays
j0sheezy: yeah very bold take
spookyknockknock: Everyone is r@cist to some extend tho no?
granola__bar: if you subscribe to forbes you get all BS emails
nytherino: does he already have the hardware?
darkzade: @nytherino ye
dps910: @spookyknockknock no
pepeega: Ye he has FPGA to run it on
nytherino: the big one with gddr6?
pepeega: But you can buy RISC-V cpus too! (Bad ones)
the_gilps: Quiting my gig at Facebook today boys, I needed more time to watch this stream
pepeega: I love gibi asmr! lol
granola__bar: in what ide is he coding?
hardtarget4: facebook is a scam anw
capataci: @granola__bar vi
spookyknockknock: I'm real... I don't BS
frode_0xa: vim, the best editor
heytherechat: @granola__bar  no ide
oreo_171: yeah facebook bad bro
Vinists: what prefix key do you use for tmux?
pepeega: I saw facebook is going to make smartwatches with two cameras. Amazing.
spookyknockknock: Ppl that say they're not r@cist at all are liers
system1100: what is RISC-V ?
mboumaza: The god has arisen from his layer
haris_pap: Facebook's going down boys, the feds will bring them down
my_synthetic_dreams: @pepeega im gonna puke at that thought
oreo_171: @Vinists he has his config on GH
Onigumo69: "amazing" LUL
big_dog_genetics: we got Vim Diesel shoulder deep in python
ijjop: Using this work for something later? Or just displaying your fast typing skills
karanberries: @system1100 google is your friend
j0sheezy: @ijjop displaying fast typing skills
Vinists: @oreo_171 GH?
granola__bar: does vim have option in the bottom where you can go through bash and other folders of vim?
heytherechat: @system1100  an ISA, like arm
pepeega: RISC-V is an open source, free, extendible RISC instruction set, something companies been wanting for a long time.
the_gilps: haha doubtful, with inflation michael burry's betting FB & Googs do pretty good
oreo_171: @Vinists GitHub
spookyknockknock: Port@nd is like the most r@cist place on earth but they're cryptic about it
Vinists: @oreo_171 lol, of course, thanks
system1100: uu thank you @heytherechat
heytherechat: risc-v is like arm but open source
karanberries: what and who is gibi
commandpaul: its just crossed wires in be :P
ijjop: j0sheezy are you upcoming mod for his channel?
granola__bar: ?does vim have option in the bottom where you can go through bash and other folders of vim?
spookyknockknock: I have a lot more respect for honest ppl than anything cryptic
big_dog_genetics: bought a crib for momma of that python shit
j0sheezy: oh no, we just crossed wires Kappa
Santiago_LHC: @granola__bar vim is a terminal coder. there aren't "folders of vim"
frode_0xa: @granola__bar thats tmux
granola__bar: @neeeeb1234 lul
granola__bar: just lol
the_gilps: yup
pepeega: Cryptic is the language of boomer companies that will go bankrupt lol
commandpaul: return address
haris_pap: Not trying to defend anyone, just trying to figure out the rules of the channel.  Why did Storm's message get deleted ?
commandpaul: pipelining rip
Santiago_LHC: dumb questions, off topic questions = timeout/ban
spookyknockknock: Bro let me show the real technology that'll take over
spookyknockknock: I'm just trying to help you
spookyknockknock: and also get out of this python love plz
mrpentakills: what do you think about front running?
the_gilps: yeah cause pissing people off is bad
dunstableramsay: @Santiago_LHC prison rules SwiftRage
Croww__: ü§î
Thomasbrah: That chair looks like it has sick ventilation
the_gilps: @dunstableramsay haha
karanberries: ok from 30 seconds of googling I've learnt that gibi is a youtuber. How does she have to do with risk-v
karanberries: *risc
my_synthetic_dreams: lmao @ ppl hating on python.
granola__bar: what is the difference between bash and normal terminal language
the_gilps: mo explicit da betta
oreo_171: isnt gibi some asmr chick?
pepeega: programming without pop culture references is boring
frode_0xa: Why does Chat hate python
dps910: @granola__bar what does that mean?
Santiago_LHC: @granola__bar dude, this is not the stream to ask noob questions. All you are asking can be googled.
my_synthetic_dreams: @frode_0xa bc primitive obsession lol
dunstableramsay: @pepeega aye...
j0sheezy: ye no more noob questions that are googleable
Pureelectricitys: Didn't gibi create Spirited Away?
lambda_calculas: will you add this to the fromthetransistor repo ?
big_dog_genetics: george is the pusha t of programming
heytherechat: frode_0xa I want my semicolons
eusudologic: How did you learn how to program?? (hahahahahah joke)
granola__bar: ye sorry that was a du@b question
pepeega: fortran doesn't have semicolons, it's older than my grandparents, just saying
frode_0xa: @heytherechat But you can have colons
BlueSeamoose: noobs rawrPew
granola__bar: @BlueSeamoose you were a noob once too
haris_pap: He googled things though, he didn't ask people (or maybe he did, idk)
big_dog_genetics: as pusha said : this channel aint for the conscious, this is for the mud made monsters
the_gilps: uh oh we already optimizing
heytherechat: frode_0xa  yeah, but it's not a "best practice" and the interpreter will complain
granola__bar: @haris_pap asking two question doesnt mean i dont google
BlueSeamoose: @haris_pap lol
frode_0xa: @heytherechat No i mean the colon after like if something:
dunstableramsay: asking d.umb questions are how we become undumbened
BlueSeamoose: i'm sorry that was for big dog genetics
haris_pap: I think all geo and the mods are saying is "If you can find out by goolging a bit, dont annoy people by asking them the question
pepeega: colons do something tho, they prevent printing results or something
commandpaul: that can go straight to your ALU
granola__bar: @dunstableramsay lul
flightless_bird: why don't you outsource this
spookyknockknock: All python dudes should move to Seattle. They belong there not silicon valey
Santiago_LHC: @dunstableramsay no, it's not. It's perfectly fine to be a noob, it's not okay to not know how to find the answers that you need.
pepeega: language wars üìâ
j0sheezy: im a ch00b
heytherechat: oh no, i was joking about the end statement in c-like languages. I find that much more legible
spookyknockknock: bruh you're crazy
granola__bar: i am tomcr00se
my_synthetic_dreams: @spookyknockknock how esoteric
iTeQo_: What happened to the sales of your company? Why did they decline so much?
fiendodto: what is he doin
tirefire: @flightless_bird that's the question that managers ask when they don't understand it
vybster: what about the SHKRELI instruction Kappa
spookyknockknock: Seattle actually has really good ppl, good food, and great atmosphere
oreo_171: @iTeQo_ probably because of Nabeel day
nytherino: is he adding new instructions to risc-v?
granola__bar: @iTeQo_ who needs auto drivable cars in pandemic?
the_gilps: wait why do we have SRLI twice?
big_dog_genetics: big trap party when shkreli out üé∂üé∂
commandpaul: the funct 3 is common for the "same" operation
the_gilps: gracias
tirefire: this feels like a ctf challenge
foti_kasparov: Hi George
haris_pap: Do these people actually get banned or just timed out ?
pepeega: adding instructions would be interesting! just implementing now tho
karanberries: is SLLI also SLL
Santiago_LHC: mostly timed out, but depends on how little they get the vibe of the stream
spookyknockknock: As long as you run away from chr1st1ans america is pretty dope everywhere
commandpaul: Fence is simply put to flush caches, or make memory consists got visible
BlueSeamoose: BlueSeamoose subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! fun stuff, thanks for sharing
tripcloth: @georgehotz do git push im horny
cryptocat0x00: Why RISC-V?
chadrick_011: !uptime
lulzury: python makes life much easier
commandpaul: you can setup the input values correctly and then in a funct 3 based alu do the operation
coolcake2: @cryptocat0x00 what should it be then?
big_dog_genetics: im not really that convinced thay vim makes you faster, dudes in vscode be super fast with all the snippets and stuff
pepeega: because risc-v is the ‚ú®future‚ú®
spookyknockknock: Python is written in C. So technically love C and you don't know it
big_dog_genetics: bud vim does make your chest hair grow
Santiago_LHC: you code where you like most. People love making a big fuss about what's "the best".
mik12f4: Odd timing for stream
my_synthetic_dreams: @lulzury people hate on it because its easier to learn and they think that using more verbose languages means your'e a better programmer
pepeega: issue with vim is it's impossible to close
WoZZo_: !commands
my_synthetic_dreams: that + its popularity
Santiago_LHC: :q boom vim closed
big_dog_genetics: @santiago_lhc tru ü§å
pepeega: ü§£
oMYTHRA: just restart your computer Kappa
neeeeb1234: do you people use an IDE when coding?
commandpaul: you can create a shared alu function , modular reuse like hardware
‰Ω†ÁöÑÁå´: @big_dog_genetics true, it's mostly about preference, you definitely shouldn't change to vim solely because you want to be more productive
StormWorlds: i am free , but also pissed why the timeout ?
Kmynis: @neeeeb1234  ye, too much of a noob to work without it
Santiago_LHC: You probably asked a dumb question
bewdism: @my_synthetic_dreams that's fair but you also have to keep in mind that its slower compared to rust/c++
spookyknockknock: Why do you need to build a CPU if you're trying to do matrix multiplication in verilog?
neeeeb1234: @Kmynis same
commandpaul: it gets the value , relative to pc
pepeega: he doesn't need to do anything, he's learning
commandpaul: yes, doesn't update pc
neeeeb1234: what is the cpu giong to be used for
nytherino: an equivalent would be buying a lot of 3090s
spookyknockknock: you could try systemVerilog, if you want something with more python like syntax
big_dog_genetics: duded that use linux be optimizing their distro/vim setup for like 15 years talking bout its faster
pepeega: loll
commandpaul: imm is signed btw
pepeega: I don't understand why people care so much tbh about how people set things up, but whatever
my_synthetic_dreams: @bewdism obviously its slower, but he's doing this for FUN. and python is more suited for higher level applications + useful libraries.
bewdism: @my_synthetic_dreams oh no doubt about that, it was more of a general case
lulzury: what is the reference program?
spookyknockknock: That's an interesting way to create an "accelerator"
darthchalke: Do you ever miss intellisense provided by a bloated modern IDE?
lulzury: ah I see from the code, it's one of the riscv tests
haris_pap: They either can't see improvement on their skills or they really want to squeeze any drop of (advantage) they can get (which imo is too far and pointless). @pepeega
pepeega: You can have no IDE and still intellisense with vscode. That's what most do
my_synthetic_dreams: @lebop ask your local search engine
PanTrakX: Kappa
JrGoomer1: LUL
danrod43: hes in a flow state
spookyknockknock: You try to go fast, you end up like him, learning about verilog in python... lol there's difference with programming and HDL
danrod43: don't disturb him
Santiago_LHC: Dumb questions (like "what's he doing", "what program is that", "what keyboard", "how to code") = timeout/ban.
spookyknockknock: HDL = hardware description language bro...
sanree: @Santiago_LHC do you even array bro
nytherino: at the end he is trying to emulate the instructions he is trying to create for risc-v to know if they will work on the fgpa?
karanberries: you broke my heart
JrGoomer1: LUL
spookyknockknock: ya you broke my heart too lol
karanberries: F
jeeves_0: if im not mistaken theres a loop in __getitem__

Lana_Lux: @serotta_cyclist thank you!
PanTrakX: nvidia owns arm?
nytherino: will the matrixes be at most 32x32 ?
GeneralSoak: softbank?
haris_pap: Nvidia and softbank yes
coolcake2: i think ARM owns ARM still
broceps1337: whats wrong wioth Nvidia? @georgehotz
spookyknockknock: verilog is HDL... just look up the difference first before misleading young python engineers
bewdism: i forgot about nvidia doing that
lulzury: Yay for open standards
yoda_droid: My soldering iron has a RISC-V microprocessor
Keyeh: fuck nvidia
dunstableramsay: layin' some piped instruction oh yeah
coolcake2: did nvida manage to close the deal? I thought no
sansquick: Nvidia anti competition and shit drivers on Linux
amand221: shit
ivche1337: isn't python gonna be slow for this?
haris_pap: I don't get what they own exactly though.  Is it some sort of a patent  ?
serotta_cyclist: yes RiSC-V is hot as open source instruction set from Berkeley U.
pepeega: I really like nvidia, they provide great tools for my industry (HPC)
spookyknockknock: A correct verilog semantics does not lead to correct synthesis
karanberries: where is the test from
GeneralSoak: @pepeega extremely pepega thing to say
hardtarget4: risc-v drip
commandpaul: use the m test for add
commandpaul: v test needs user mode
haris_pap: Every company used to be cool until the corpos took the leadership
pepeega: Why? AMD provides no alternatives
commandpaul: rv32i-m-addi
zx_ml: what GPUs you use at your company?
GeneralSoak: true sadly no alternative
commandpaul: instead of the v test
64pillars: leatherjacket buff
hardtarget4: jensen's leather jacket game is on point. gotta give it to him
haris_pap: He has a bunch of 3090s @zx_ml
GeneralSoak: esp for deep learning stuff
pepeega: If nvidia provides amazing tools for GPU accelerated wavelet transforms and whatever, we'll buy their supercomputers hehe, simple
wmgl9: i never seen vitalik at the club
macrovest: dicks = money?
spookyknockknock: That I agree
sansquick: they do have the best gpus
arnovw93: fake money LUL
spookyknockknock: no one likes rich ppl sucks anyways
brickeyy: D:
wild3dreams: Why
macrovest: i do @spookyknockknock
Cracktune: EXPLAIN
HoopaUnbounded: @georgehotz how did you start riscv programming
haris_pap: Larry page
sansquick: google hate
Cracktune: expand on that a little bit please
Pureelectricitys: Larry david
elenareyiz: What's real money then? @georgehotz
Venomflop: Who is the bitcoin guy he was talm bout
zx_ml: @haris_pap is it legal to use 3090 for commercial stuff?
tirefire: this is why we tune in for these hot takes without explanation
spookyknockknock: @macrovest ok no one expect you... you're famous now
hardtarget4: wonder if sergey wears the google glass when tripping nuts on DMT
doesntevenplaygames: does every vim user slam the return key after :w like that?
haris_pap: I think so yes @zx_ml
serotta_cyclist: INtel looking to buy company SiFive they big on Risc-V
big_dog_genetics: how does that old saying go: companies are first run by engineers, then by accounts, then by lawyers and then they run out of business
coolcake2: @zx_ml there is no legal obligation when you buy such products
darkbouls: Do you think RISC-V can become widely adopted in the future, given how hard it was for Apple to transition to ARM?
pepeega: If you absolutely want 3090 performance for commercial stuff, just buy A6000s. Little more expensive and better support
darkbouls: @doesntevenplaygames hell yes
PanTrakX: @doesntevenplaygames yeah, it saves better
doesntevenplaygames: that is why i do it too
doesntevenplaygames: its like a little victory
granola__bar: is visual studio cool or tmux?
tr0lkong: i shift zz and then have to open vim again...
spookyknockknock: This whole C0v1d tr0ll the crap out of you bro no?

big_dog_genetics: brooo i got an MBA im really good at making power point presentations broo hire me
nytherino: its cloud
PanTrakX: @nytherino it probably gonna rain then Kappa
pepeega: very good at making meaningless acronyms to separate continuous change in categories
nytherino: lol
spookyknockknock: It's funny cuz I kn3w... I did pretty with st0cks cuz I know the b00m3rs are tr0lls just like you and I
pepeega: correlation != causal implication
waterisamazng: gateron switvhes
socialdependency: George is the cuck of code. He‚Äôs gonna take your project and treat it right.
commandpaul: you could trap but that's the privileged spec and the of goes to mtvec
dunstableramsay: You can't put your ARMs around a memory
spookyknockknock: who the f attaches a ms research paper here
NuttyOdin: !plan
spookyknockknock: ms is literally the dumbest company in the world
granola__bar: @spookyknockknock lloolololloo
Santiago_LHC: Dumb questions (like "what's he doing", "what program is that", "what keyboard", "how to code") = timeout/ban.
pepeega: don't read papers on websites that aren't publishers
pepeega: including microsoft!
madflash19: im writing a chip8
spookyknockknock: @pple is pretty smart on the other hand
CemDK: !twitchcore
PanTrakX: shery u dont need college to learn anything about technology, everything is free on the web
haris_pap: exactly ^
sansquick: @georgehotz what‚Äôs your favorite high performance (I guess without runtime and compiled) lang
pepeega: why? ms is growing faster, that's all that matters in the end isn't it
NuttyOdin: @Santiago_LHC It will be good to put a bot to let viewers know about the current project is doing.
Santiago_LHC: @NuttyOdin George would have to do that
spookyknockknock: @pple had the right ideology cuz steve jobs was middle estern... anything erupean is just too dramatic and it never wins
madflash19: what is he writing a emulator
macrovest: lol
darkbouls: @pepeega I think Apple is poised to grow faster in the near future
granola__bar: he is so fast dude
sansquick: I wish I could learn vim that well
hardtarget4: garage fab swag
Brave594: can somebody tell me what kind of language is this?  I don't understand anything, but would be great atleast know what knid of programming language is this MingLee
GeneralSoak: how much adderall tho
darkbouls: @Brave594 it's python
pepeega: @pepeega idk, don't see a reason why. and im not biased here btw, I dislike ms and like apple
granola__bar: @sansquick what do you mean learn vim?
nimbl_o7: @sansquick gotta start sometime
haris_pap: What about Apple ?
wild3dreams: WRONG*
willreborn: I feel like watching this guy makes me smarter even though I have no idea what I‚Äôm looking at lol
spookyknockknock: @granola__bar he's fastly wasting time
coolmacjr: @Brave594 scratch
sansquick: I mean I can but I have to invest time
darkbouls: @willreborn same lol
FullManaShen: hey what isp do you use and what is the cm difference between your arm and the table and what is the distance between your chair and the table? wanting to know so I can learn to code better
nimbl_o7: @sansquick but that's just terminal
terramelos: I don't know anything about programming, but I do enjoy this stream!
64pillars: AMD üöÄ AMD üöÄ AMD üöÄ
imleoaguiar: What happened to nvidia
pepeega: let's just all remember intel also runs RISC, the only difference is M1 is native ARM while intel translates
sur86: Ooh nothing, source is on GitHub anyway
darkbouls: @sansquick it's actually pretty easy, there are a lot of resources online, just try writing simple programs with it and you'll be up to speed in no time
sansquick: It‚Äôs terminal with extra commands
heytherechat: I'm a fan of what amd is doing
Santiago_LHC: @terramelos This is the right attitude
coolcake2: from bob
sansquick: @darkbouls point
spookyknockknock: Mark my words, my company will rise. I'm recovering from hard work.
granola__bar: jih
Brave594: @coolmacjr  so now is it Python or Sratch ? MingLee
granola__bar: @Brave594 python
pepeega: I'm excited for NVIDIA's upcoming cpus tbh. They're going to be designed for parallel use with cpus
terramelos: @terramelos I think I would to get more deeper to this and George inspires me a lot
pepeega: gpus*
spookyknockknock: But I wanted to try to help the python engineers here
PanTrakX: @spookyknockknock what is your company?
spookyknockknock: it's in stealth mode
Brave594: okay, tyty!
mrjj452: anyone know what the giving function is supposed to do?
PanTrakX: @spookyknockknock ahh okay, well good luck then :)
ChillCrunch37: !commands
heytherechat: no way nvidia buys arm
mrjj452: *gibi
waterisamazng: hotz archives r u here
spookyknockknock: I don't need good luck.
madflash19: is it a disassembler
pepeega: nvidia's future plans are largely based on the assumption they acquire ARM; it's likely
spookyknockknock: thx anyways
Santiago_LHC: @ChillCrunch37 No bot. Rules: Dumb questions (like "what's he doing", "what program is that", "what keyboard", "how to code") = timeout/ban.
PanTrakX: @spookyknockknock no, i take it back Kappa
dagobetting: @georgehotz would you biohack some live frogs from the-odin?
spookyknockknock: I always tell ppl. Keep the good luck for yourself. You will need.
heytherechat: still, that's such a monopoly move... doubt it will happen
heytherechat: since the whole world relies on arm based stuff
darkbouls: has he gone through ARM CPU architecture before this?
jorn90: @spookyknockknock, don‚Äôt be such a toxic dude man..
pepeega: if nvidia and arm don't compete, how can the acquisition be a monopoly concern?
GeneralSoak: imo regulators will never let nvidia buy arm it will totally fuck up mobile
heytherechat: well, arm makes gpus...
Slippery3: "i don't know how memory works" LOL
pepeega: so does AMD, so not monopoly
tekichan21: Does he use ?
commandpaul: no cache ez
yar3_yar3: my memory doesn't work
spookyknockknock: If you need good luck, you do not understand life, or God... but that's a different topic... the point is it's not toxic.

ChillCrunch37: @ChillCrunch37 @Santiago_LHC - your response should be the only response for any command then. thx
eatpopcornalways: This is giving me flashback to uni when writing code for the MIPS microprocessor.
KokkelinKivetys: where are all of these numbers coming from?
jeeves_0: is there going to be lower qualities on stream anytime soon? 1080 sometimes lags it would be a lot better if there are any other ones
j0sheezy: Anyone know wtf going on? Cause I do
heytherechat: we'll see, if nvidia does acquire it.. imagine the mess going forward with licensing stuff
Santiago_LHC: @ChillCrunch37 Yeah, we need a bot just for that.
waterisamazng: @j0sheezy what is going on man
j0sheezy: Kappa
heytherechat: nvidia's markup is always high
pepeega: nvidia doesn't go out of the way to make compatibility with existing products hard, so I don't think ARM will be an exception tbh
Ne0Zer0: risc-v PogChamp
pepeega: I'd be much more worried if apple acquired ARM
Santiago_LHC: ARM1
commandpaul: there are width modifiers too
Ne0Zer0: iARM
henistein: henistein subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 6 months!
commandpaul: byte half word word
pepeega: (which isn't unlikely, apple is the only company that actually pays ARM for the right to edit their instruction set, which has costed them billions)
darkbouls: @pepeega uhhh Apple was one of the founders of ARM no?
terramelos: is there any channels where George's followers talk?
pepeega: maybe involved but I don't think so
maciejfiedler: luigi
terramelos: like disc or something
heytherechat: apple is particularly fucked if the deal goes through
Saltyballss: yea super ez
spookyknockknock: Get a nice Zync Xilinix FPGA
abhay0301: what we doing today?
pepeega: do you think nvidia will no longer allow apple to pay for their custom instruction sets?
nytherino: https://sci-hub.do/10.3390/electronics9061005 have you seen this?
Brave594: it is so motivating to see ppl programming like this easy... makes me wanna learn it, but when I start it, I just get demotivated so easly ... BibleThump
heytherechat: @darkbouls  I think so, they have one of those founder licenses or whatever
darkbouls: The company was founded in November 1990 as Advanced RISC Machines Ltd and structured as a joint venture between Acorn Computers, Apple Computer (now Apple Inc.) and VLSI Technology.
darkbouls: from wikipedia
commandpaul: yeah
pepeega: oh interesting, didn't know
darkbouls: When Nvidia announced they were buying ARM just as the M1 chip came out I thought they wanted to compete with Apple til I learned that
pepeega: seems like apple owns no part of ARM tho today
darkbouls: they have founder's rights or something like @heytherechat said
Fantastic_Man: @Brave594 It takes years of practice. You've got to stars somewhere
pepeega: main reason nvidia wants to buy ARM I think is because cpus today just suck and can't keep up with their gpus
heytherechat: But I don't know to what extent that holds up when nvidia releases a new core
heytherechat: do they license it like everyone else?
Zepcon7: @darkbouls That was also my thought about NVIDIA
spookyknockknock: I'm falling sleep. Great stream bro
pepeega: AMD is reentering hybrid cpu/gpu machines, and nvidia is incapable. that's likely the future, so nvidia **has** to buy ARM
Brave594: @Fantastic_Man  I know, and requires a hella lot of time MingLee
haris_pap: What's the job market for this kind of programming ? (aka no web dev, iOS, android stuff)
GeneralSoak: nvidia has gpu + arm cores on a single chip already
pepeega: embedded
AKspirits: Happy Friday my man
heytherechat: you can put ram in the package too
heytherechat: it's not on the die but latency is way lower
pepeega: ye and they're going to make amazingly powerful ones I heard in a few years, independent of whether they wind up buying ARM or not
pepeega: nonetheless it makes it way easier to compete
Fantastic_Man: @haris_pap There are tons of jobs at quant funds on Wall Street, where you can program hardware for high frequency trading.
spookyknockknock: i miss the days that NN were underground... why is that as soon as something becomes popular it gets ruined???
heytherechat: it's fair to say that arm is changing the cpu landscape
sharkonet: PogChamp
pepeega: ARM marketshare in servers has 10 folded in 1 year
aluminum_extruder: why are you emulating a riscv just use ur own CPU dummy
commandpaul: switch to the p test
pepeega: how about that for a growth rate lol
heytherechat: the m1 chip is gonna change desktop pc chips in the near future
spookyknockknock: Every dummy nowdays publishes a nonsense with NN
commandpaul: rv32ui-p-add
commandpaul: no user mode
aluminum_extruder: @commandpaul nice
Santiago_LHC: big ups @commandpaul
oMYTHRA: commandpaul the goat out here
teayoflow: i helped
dedhuecilisvinec: song time?
heytherechat: Clap
Slippery3: i guess commandpaul knows what he's talking about
Santiago_LHC: VIP time
darkbouls: omg there's at least two people who understand wtf is happening here
Ne0Zer0: commandpaul day 6/11
NatelBeats: Mod givaway
NatelBeats: oh VIP
coolcake2: Clap
Joduska: Pogu
switchdv: someone actually is following what he's been doing? monkaS
dedhuecilisvinec: Pog

yoramtap: @switchdv :D
ivche1337: wait wha?
sharkonet: @commandpaul PogChamp
halo_krs: i am thinking to buy my first mac
j0sheezy: @commandpaul  actually knows what‚Äôs going on Kappa
xbowzz: l have no idea what hes doing
xbowzz: lmaooo im just watching
PanTrakX: does the python code compile into elf binary?
spookyknockknock: @halo_krs Good idea. I switched to make apps and it worked out great
Brave594: I"m like: Ahha, yeah, that's just suceeded MingLee
pepeega: macos is nice
darkbouls: @halo_krs I'm on an M1 macbook air and it's pretty sweet
heytherechat: Well , if you wanna write software to the arm apple stuff you pretty much have to buy one
pepeega: I got one too. will become a lot sweeter once support gets better
halo_krs: @halo_krs i really like apple and i want to get into apple ecosystem , i curently use windows desktop , i am cs student 1st year, but i am not sure if i should go for m1 or windows laptop, i dont want to regret it
spookyknockknock: It will be interesting to see you switch to verilog... I doubt it will go smooth
darkbouls: @halo_krs get a cheap windows laptop and shove linux on it! :D
pepeega: you can buy an intel mac and get both windows and macos native
Slippery3: +1 to shove linux on cheap windows laptop
pepeega: it'll also run tensorflow and pytorch, unlike M1
Slippery3: worked great for me in uni
halo_krs: @halo_krs haha why tho ?
spookyknockknock: @halo_krs You do not understand hardware
commandpaul: you goto a register called mtvec
heytherechat: a0-a7 are parameters
commandpaul: it's in the priv spec
lionaneesh: Its just calling write no?
halo_krs: @halo_krs LUL
grinsepilz: LUL
actionstorm_: LUL
halo_krs: it was going for @spookyknockknock
c43verge: ITS WHAT YOU DO THAT DEFINES YOU GEOHOT
commandpaul: mtvec is one of the few mandatory csrs
madflash19: what do you think about rust
commandpaul: it can be a hard-coded value
commandpaul: default trap handler
tirefire: just add it to regfile
enjoylifeallday: what problem is he trying to solve?
pepeega: imaginary ones to get better at real ones later
commandpaul: the to host from host is just fancy end of test signalling infrastructure
KtArchived: heya first time in the stream
Santiago_LHC: Rules: Dumb questions (like "what's he doing", "what program is that", "what keyboard", "how to code") = timeout/ban.
lionaneesh: yeah
lionaneesh: I get all of it
commandpaul: it gets worse :P checkout warl
commandpaul: but you can get away with a lot
kenierpenier: Sadge
muojo: yyj1 yyj2

KtArchived: who gets all of this
c43verge: vim shortcut master
fustybazongas: prunt
toolegit2quit_: is he writing an emulator?
c43verge: i ve never seen someone edit and test code so fast
lionaneesh: @toolegit2quit_ yeah seems like it
lionaneesh: for a RISC-V instruction set
commandpaul: that can be zero
commandpaul: a lot of them can be unimplemented and return default values
darkbouls: @commandpaul how did you come upon this knowledge
darkbouls: what gods do I need to worship?
pepeega: fr I'd like to learn riscv too like this
hamzard1: riscv was a scam all along
dalp0019: its probably, they exists to implements locks
pigporkman: what are we doing chat
tripcloth: @georgehotz what's the purpose of doing a risc-v core in python? just curiou
yousseless: Do you share your code somewhere?
jackoregankenny: Is it just me or is the vol low?
tr0lkong: it's you..
MrKaragoz: Vol is fine
vybster: sounds fine to me, check twitch volume
commandpaul: oh that's the end of the test the scalp triggers the shutdown mechanism
madflash19: @yousseless https://github.com/geohot/twitchcore/blob/master/cpu.py
r0pch41n: @yousseless github lol
Zerobizzy: what is he building?
pigporkman: wait so is this like a RISC-V cpu emulator on python?
MrKaragoz: yep
commandpaul: ecall *
pigporkman: ah interesting
nytherino: do you need license for creating risc-v instructions?
EliNBaE: @georgehotz why arent you creating cryptorelated stuff? there's a lot of money in it, perhaps you'll do well so you can move out of your mothers basement
yousseless: @madflash19 thanks
Slippery3: where are test files? i don't see them in github
Ne0Zer0: LUL
dalp0019: georgehotz, could you enlarge font a bit? its difficult to read easy
darkbouls: LUL
pepeega: @nytherino nope! that's why it's the ‚ú®future‚ú®
yistarostin: what is your key brd?
enjoylifeallday: LUL
commandpaul: you could debug against spike the official simulator
mtwainj: does George use oop or functional programming and why?
MrKaragoz: @EliNBaE Why are you mad? He can works on whatever he wants..
hir0andobey: what is twitchcore?
Ne0Zer0: we only use urbit here Kappa
Slippery3: found it at https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests thanks
pigporkman: lol @Ne0Zer0 thoughts on mencius moldbug?
ivche1337: it's an implementation of the RISC-V architecture
ivche1337: @hir0andobey
Ne0Zer0: @pigporkman don't know em
allxm_: George what do you think of using distributed computing in order to democratise AI? Doesn't seem right that some of the most powerful models will be concentrated in the hands of a few tech giants
B0Bhead: Cheer100 @georgehotz Finished my paper on SLAM implementation on a real robot, used twitchslam as a PoC, thanks I guess Cheer100
james1037: thank you! for Showing how you work
commandpaul: where are you jumping to the start of fail ?
pigporkman: @Ne0Zer0 that's curtis yarvin the creator of urbit
pigporkman: he's got some wild political takes
commandpaul: yeah
Ne0Zer0: no thoughts
allxm_: Maybe some form of non-rent-seeking crypto could be used to facilitate better allocation of computing resources
NatelBeats: we back
B0Bhead: we back
B0Bhead: lmao @NatelBeats

allxm_: geohot is locked in
B0Bhead: you face is on some code, maybe move it to the bottom middle @georgehotz
caiquejjx: wassup
obtean: Does he read chat?
caiquejjx: @obtean sometimes
obtean: He got a straight face mode on
bolderhero: is he writing a risc v emu?
gamingdabbler: I wonder how many people here exactly know what he's doing
yeethoven68: @gamingdabbler I recognize some numbers
switchdv: have you tried implementing MIPS before?
caiquejjx: beautiful assembly
nabzagoreinsulin: hey dude can you move your cam a little bit right we cant see the codes
madflash19: wtf happend
obtean: So what are we supposed to do when we don‚Äôt have a clue about what he is exactly doing right now?
commandpaul: there is a write value before the ecall
switchdv: @gamingdabbler if you have dug deep into computer architecture you would have an idea of what he's doing
obtean: Hey dude! Your face has blocked the terminal.
gamingdabbler: @yeethoven68 Thanks. I asked this because, I'm new to this I'd like to learn more.
aymamoon: @nabzagoreinsulin I second this motion
l8nightt: Plsss fix facecam
obtean: Ok I assume he is doing something amazing
GazzarlOl: if i got it right this will be used with tinygrad?
Psyko_live: ya top right better
AidanPlaysGames: what's he working on?
Merwanedr: Yo George! Got you geohot.eth (ENS domain) a couple of days ago, where can I transfer you the ownership?
mero_1181: Hey George can you move your face on the other corner?
gamingdabbler: @switchdv Thanks, I understand this is a big topic.  Any suggestions on where to get started on this?
doco33: my favourite streamer!
madflash19: aren't you gonna use unittest LUL
obtean: I like George too @doco33
obtean: His stream doesn‚Äôt support transcoding as well
sliderspy: could you move the webcam output? we can't see
eatpopcornalways: your webcam is blocking half of your coding now
switchdv: @switchdv computer systems & architecture is the topic, i'm pretty sure you would find some topic around instruction set, assembly, etc
darkbouls: @georgehotz move facecam?
obtean: The only thing I can see is his shaved face üòÄ
darkbouls: yay
caiquejjx: !followage
r0pch41n: @gamingdabbler  on their site they have there paper and spike is on github so you can directly get your hands dirty
commandpaul: the branch stage is typically done after the alu stage and reuses the alu
madflash19: @switchdv you got any idea for a noob project, risc seems kinda pro level
madflash19: @switchdv
Merwanedr: Yo george, got you geohot.eth (ENS domain) a couple of days ago, where can I transfer you the ownership?
darkbouls: @switchdv do you think it's worth dabbling in if you don't have an actual interest in creating/editing hardware? Would it help you appreciate code better or nah?
switchdv: @switchdv i actually have implemented MIPS before on VHDL, and it was not that hard but really got me going, and its probably one of the simplest architectures out there
madflash19: @switchdv thnx for suggestion
B0Bhead: B0Bhead is gifting 1 Tier 1 Subs to georgehotz's community! They've gifted a total of 1 in the channel!
B0Bhead: B0Bhead gifted a Tier 1 sub to kid_cudi_!
GTozzi: does anyone know if his vimrc is published somewher
r0pch41n: I would just build spike write some simple c programms and then look at the elf
B0Bhead: @georgehotz yo can you use that keybo ard thing where it shows the key youve pressed (from the pokemon run but that one seemed bad or some other one)? would be neat to learn some useful vim shortcuts
kid_cudi_: @B0Bhead thanks for the sub appreciate it
darkbouls: @GTozzi he doesn't seem to have changed much
switchdv: @switchdv i think knowing it can help you appreciate better for sure, but i dont think you would be changing your code just because you know it
Fadamaka: hm
GTozzi: yeah I was more wondering about what looks like plugins on the bottom denoting the tags time ect. @darkbouls
RobbieBillions: Thats tmux
darkbouls: @GTozzi ah those are tmux
agnikaibeats: !vimrc
GTozzi: ah
obtean: The fun thing about George‚Äòs stream is that he gets error most of the time.
obtean: !commands
DrKnight22: bro this is blowing my mind lol
commandpaul: if I'm not mistaken the fencei test just tries to execute "data"
alius_anima: tl;dw of what geo is trying to get done?

Merwanedr: Not spamming, just a gift from a fan and apparently he hasn't seen it yet:)
obtean: I am trying to have fun while I‚Äòm learning
pepeega: I envy people that can have fun learning lol
pepeega: Maybe I've been in school for too long
alius_anima: crypto is a bubble I hope these rent seeking shills lose all their momne
alius_anima: *money
oMYTHRA: @pepeega studying something you genuinely like also helps
switchdv: @alius_anima momney looks like a nice memey word
pepeega: Sure. That's what I do. Still.
alius_anima: @switchdv lmao
obtean: RA is that SP is that! Great!
pepeega: everything loses its magic
nabeel_co: It's not about learning, it's about curiosity. It's about figuring out how it works.
obtean: @nabeel_co üëç
Fadamaka: does anyone in chat knows whats going on?
pepeega: indeed, a lot of learning I end up doing is curiosity driven and that's always fun; consider it free time
big_dog_genetics: im just here for the rants
Keyeh: we're learning risc-v
aymamoon: @Fadamaka no we just like to watch
commandpaul: it keeps the signed bit srai
obtean: Couple of days ago he‚Äôs gotten a chip called tinygrade and now he is gonna make it wo.

Crozbo: i learn this kind of stuff implementing Chip-8, it is simple project for beginners
big_dog_genetics: me vs your friends Pog
Sebbananen: sounds like a useful thing to do to learn
Fadamaka: is this considered hardware programming?
commandpaul: u is unsigned
obtean: LUL
oldboysounds: no @Fadamaka hardware programming would be more like VHDL or verilog
obtean: @fadamaka what else can it be?
rafyasphyxiar: what is happening?
obtean: He is working RISC assembly instructions
obtean: on*
rafyasphyxiar: 5Head
Fadamaka: I dont know I work with java that is  too high up for me to understand any of this, even the basic principles, I keep looking stuff up and only finding even more stuff I dont understand LUL
JumpTwiice: what is a RISC-V core
CrylonBlue: why does he do that?
svm_tv: @obtean has he made his own program that is compatible with the RISC architecture? Or is he developing his own core that is compatible with the RISC ISA?
JumpTwiice: 2nd semester CS noob her
Fadamaka: @JumpTwiice RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five"[1]) is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA)
obtean: The only way to sharpen your curiosity is to look up some stuff you don‚Äôt actually understand
commandpaul: compare is unsigned after the value is sign extended
Fadamaka: @JumpTwiice an abstract model of a computer
esteve_11: What is he doing?
obtean: @svm_tv dude! I‚Äôm got here about 15 mins ago! He is not reading the chat so sorry I dunno!
svm_tv: @obtean oh my b
obtean: All well @svm_tv
Prince0511: That's not clean code though...
0xgrand27: @Prince0511 though still better than yours mate
Aegrah: Burn Kappa
Aegrah: sometimes you gotta fix the logic first and then make it clean, no?
winningbigforever: is this a  virtual cpu
Fadamaka: I actually would like to learn something like this, but I always learn by actually doing it, and don't know what I could start to fiddle with
0xgrand27: @Aegrah yepp, right!
Crozbo: @Fadamaka try implement Chip-8, you can do it in any language, it is simple project for beginner
Fadamaka: @Crozbo but do I need any hardware? or everything is done virtually?
kratosboii: sup george @georgehotz
dedhuecilisvinec: you gotta be fast
Crozbo: @Fadamaka you don't need any special hardware
obtean: Hardware virtualization then!

0xgrand27: @dorkmo, Woow, that was unexpected, thanks mate!
cryonicarian: ratirlCoffee
kratosboii: the *only* debugger @B0Bhead
alius_anima: You should title this stream 'Road to BTFO NVIDIA'
dorkmo: SeemsGood HeyGuys
commandpaul: different widths
Schuhbart: @Fadamaka even if you are doing actual hardware design (with a language like sv or vhdl) then you can still simulate it with free simulation programs like verilator. but this is more like a parser for riscv assembly programs than hardware design
LittleBiggyStan: y use a mac tho
alius_anima: So does this compooote yet?
Santiago_LHC: https://github.com/geohot/twitchcore.
Santiago_LHC: https://github.com/geohot/twitchcore
Schuhbart: both of those things are interesting of course and the latter is easier to get started with, actual hardware design is a bit unintuitive if you have only done sw programming
WizXMike: Just saw the tweet, props to you for making more than you raised for real
obtean: Thanks for your explanation @schuhbart
MrBankster: this man is a wizard
Fadamaka: @Schuhbart I usually work with large amount of data in the cloud, also trying to dip my feet in kubernetes, this topic is really really far from what I do
idkfa22: idkfa22 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 4 months!
switchdv: @Schuhbart exactly, hardware programming is nothing like the procedural algorithm like in sw programming
MauriceChavez: GEORGE IS LEVE

cryonicarian: ratirlMe
RS_Ggs: what is this even for
commandpaul: it flushes caches
mahoganydoors99: @georgehotz Did you take part in the waymo open dataset challenge?
commandpaul: you don't have a cache
directrix13: lol
Santiago_LHC: poetry in commit messages is what I live for
commandpaul: it does more than tha but simply the easiest implementation is to flush the cache fully
luspr: professional commit message
obtean: Wow!
felipef0ntana: !project
Dervolleschlanke: How do I become more like you and less like me

directrix13: It's pretty simple
B0Bhead: @Dervolleschlanke stop asking people on the internet for advice and go out
hardwallz: let's learn it!
Schuhbart: do fences do anything if you dont have out of order execution or even a pipeline?
BirdUp123: have you ever thought of make a coin for individual twitch streams ?
commandpaul: python to hw
obtean: When are you gonna stream @lana_lux
obtean: @hardwallz good idea! Let‚Äôs focus on the parser
hardwallz: How does verilog even look like?
pepeega: stop wanting to be someone youre not
alius_anima: So has he got it to compooote yet?
MauriceChavez: when is next kagglethon?
FrancisForever: do you play video games George?
rafyasphyxiar: what is this code gonna do tho?
directrix13: are you trying to get this core created before Intel buys SiFive and closes a bunch of shit?
BirdUp123: MODS : does he read chat /
woodpecker991: can we make twitch award cheapeth for channel points
woodpecker991: ?
commandpaul: comparch 101
pepeega: SiFive does not own RISC-V
directrix13: yeah but they're the main driver of the standard
obtean: @birdup123 no he doesn‚Äôt
ahahaitslit: i think you should change npc to redditor
pepeega: hmm, well, don't think they'll sell first of all, and also don't think it'll make or break other companies switching
obtean: I bet he has done the similar projects when he was younger
rodrigojacarei1: rodrigojacarei1 subscribed with Prime.
Othugmuffin: I had a dream you could SSH into peoples brains, and if you were malicious you could rm -rf their brains
pepeega: I wonder where intel is getting this cash. Just spent like $20b on 2 new fabs in arizona
random_user_name: intel always had cash
hardwallz: Borrowing. Deff not drug money.
Fadamaka: @BirdUp123 I did, if you meant crypto
Othugmuffin: And I woke up, for a couple minutes I was like man that is fucked, you could just like wipe a whole human, just leave an empty shell of a person
codiogo: some are already empty shells
Othugmuffin: Exactly, and we could make more
commandpaul: default npc value ?
obtean: @othugmuffin you can actually. It needs a lot of knowledge and experience. Some sort of hypnosis
commandpaul: got it
BirdUp123: @Fadamaka really what would you base the price on?
commandpaul: yeah
stockmonkey: @Othugmuffin but could the brain remove itself completely if you removed it's ability to do so in the first few deletes?
Zyrax222: idk what youre making but it looks interesting
Othugmuffin: This guy doesn‚Äôt even have a transparent terminal background
BotDenhart: default non playble character Kappa
LittleBiggyStan: @Othugmuffin lol i kno rite
pepeega: lol
aymen_kh: hi chat KonCha what is he doing exactly
obtean: @aymen_kh he is trying to develop a parser based on RISC-V instruction set
directrix13: does it only operate on 32-bit words?
Fadamaka: @BirdUp123 I wanted to make coins that viewers actually can mine via an extension or something, and probably would have made another "twitch stocks" just for crypto
aymen_kh: @obtean o i see, thanks
obtean: Very welcome
LittleBiggyStan: so so dum
manote: hi
BirdUp123: @Fadamaka i wanted to avoid the scamming stuff by basing on multiple factors like viewer number of active chatters and stuff like that but it seems i could never figure out how i could avoid streamer from scamming ther audience. seem like something dangerous to put in the hands of those people
ray_1010: holy shit that was fast
obtean: This stream is eating a lot of my network traffic unfortunately because it doesn‚Äôt support transcoding
commandpaul: these tests are not exhaustive btw, can't cite examples tho there are riscv "compliance" tests under dev
Makrinus: tl:dr on wtf am i watching rn ?
Fadamaka: @BirdUp123 I only wanted to make this to be exactly like twitchstocks, just something for fun, factoring in real money would be dangerous indeed
BirdUp123: @Fadamaka the mining stuff seems like a good idea but i didn't put any thought in that side of it
hardwallz: why would you need one? Ot
hardwallz: it's not transparent for the user
commandpaul: you essentially unpack the gibberish into proper register width inputs to an alu that is shared
BirdUp123: @Fadamaka twitchstocks does sound interesting tho
hardwallz: Just automagic in the background, right?
commandpaul: all that imm nonsence
Fadamaka: @BirdUp123 do you know the website?
obtean: @makrinus did you get the words ‚Äúfetch‚Äù ‚Äúdecode‚Äù? He is trying to implement RISC-V assembly instruction set in a magical way to virtualize a CPU I guess!
manote: guys what's twitchcore is supposed to do ?
hardwallz: emulate a RISC-V cpu
manote: ok ty
Inconnu_xD: risc-v emulator in python I guess
rrobomonk: @manote simulate a riscv cput so he can optimize tinygrad for it
obtean: @rrobomonk that‚Äôs it!
iTard: Is there a command for a link to whatever paper he is reading?
2ndsll: cant u use qemu for it?
bern_bach: is python good for trading bots?

BotDenhart: yes
obtean: @oleed1 it is no brainer
zach_xt: no
ray_1010: @bern_bach not just python coders, all
pepperjoao: no that would be a snake den
onemarko: @bern_bach that would be pip repo
Schuhbart: @georgehotz why not make it an actual fsm in python? where it cycles between if > id > ex > mem > wb every step
BotDenhart: pip is for birds

j0sheezy: #flushingthepipelines
commandpaul: and stall decode when you see dependency XD
shieeeeeeeeet: we doing branch prediction?
BeHonestFool: wat
blitzer36: flush the pipeline when u see a branch right
commandpaul: still better ipc and perf than single cycle
Mazarona: you would need a hazard detection unit to do flush :-(

commandpaul: last thing you might want to add here would be exceptions(mtvec, mepc, mcause, mtval), would give you an sense of aborting(flushing), so actually handling the load address violations or the illegal instructions
Streetmaniac: this code needs some switches
nerdyreplicant: I wish I could follow the code... but I can't... yet... :(
Schuhbart: im not sure if you are aware but what you have here is not actually pipelined cause you go through "stage" one after the other in a single step
Santiago_LHC: https://github.com/geohot/twitchcore
Schuhbart: well do you want to write it in verilog? haha
nerdyreplicant: but I love Python.
shieeeeeeeeet: and you don't have to worry about flushing until you do pipelining && branch prediction
commandpaul: that would be overkill, prolly switch to spike, too many corner cases in exception handling

ezamlaid: @nerdyreplicant 32
nerdyreplicant: k
Santiago_LHC: @heytherechat Absolutely. Soon they'll take the full screen. With a giant button that says "accept all" and some very obscure and hard to find settings to disable them.
livebullsh1t: risc aint 32 bits
Santiago_LHC: Unless you to a european website in which case they go "Are you sure you want to accept these shitty annoying cookies?"
tirefire: x just means unspecified, neither 1 or 0
livebullsh1t: it can be but it's not exclusive
menfie: there are browser extensions to remove most of them and ublock origin for the rest
Santiago_LHC: I use ublock and it doesn't make the notifications go away
menfie: you have enable special lists in the config
menfie: and if there are still some, just right click and block element
Santiago_LHC: Meh too much work
menfie: i agree
nerdyreplicant: what do you mean?

dillythecoder: AYYY whats up!
suriMirana: anyone got helium miners for sale ?
yllstar__: What ya doin my man
livebullsh1t: for working on word and surfing the Web indeed pretty much anything will do
davr0s: have you written other cores before
Joooooooooonas: @yllstar__  dude its literally written over the whole screen
davr0s: i presume you've written things in verilog before attempting a core
smurfd0: nice with new knowledge :)
guts_pc: what is your typical holiday like george if at all?
davr0s: or are you learning verilog by writing a riscv core
dillythecoder: Why do you prefer vim over Visual studio code
twoAze: first time on this stream!
guts_pc: its just text editor man
uint15_t: @dillythecoder dont ask those questions
uint15_t: its not about the setup
vyle01: isn't vim way older than visual studio code? He's probably just using what he's used to
trulsma: hello
guts_pc: core skill isn't built on text editor but it can help you
twoAze: !setup
shagylord: wait where is Nabeel?
guts_pc: a pencil and a paper is the best setup
davr0s: vim has less clutter
twoAze: im looking for a new monitor for WFH LUL
davr0s: RISC-V/verilog is somewhat more interseting than VIM
uint15_t: nobody ever got better by having a 4k monitor
uint15_t: same goes for editor
Joooooooooonas: its not about getting better but about the workflow
davr0s: i would like a risc-v with hwacha instead of x86+GPU
luffy2023: @ davr0s i use gedit
uint15_t: if you can auto complete every function you dont remember shit
Streetmaniac: i write my code in outlook and email it directly to my project lead
twoAze: is just want an ultra wide monitor so i can have multiple windows up. dont need anything too fancy
guts_pc: I write my code on paper with pencil
landwirtskammer: @Streetmaniac chad
j0sheezy: i use an eraser to write my code get @ me
vyle01: @uint15_t but you dont have to remember shit
quickcheck: it all comes down to elifs
uint15_t: i write my code in word
smurfd0: python has cool things
Streetmaniac: nothing wrong with auto completing code
guts_pc: I write my code in my mind
sangor: i write my code by hand on paper
vitaliypaliy: vitaliypaliy subscribed with Prime.

j0sheezy: the pipeline
twoAze: scary monkaW
Braixinh0: Learnt VHDL in uni this year, this is fuuuuuun
pedrosorio: that feeling when you see George wastes time manually replacing each instance of a string when refactoring just like you do :P

nerdyreplicant: almost like basic
twoAze: sure :)
nerdyreplicant: well not
nerdyreplicant: but still
makethetrapgreatagain: does python3 have fore loops?
livebullsh1t: yes
dillythecoder: @uint15_t y not lol whats the problem with asking a reason someone uses a specific coding editor for advice.
l4ndd0: it has five loops
her3hero: nice
jackoregankenny: I find how quickly george navigates mesmerising
livebullsh1t: for, while, try, if
livebullsh1t: hmm did I forget one
yllstar__: Hey @georgehotz im hiring. Hmu if you need a job.
lnau: @yllstar__ he has his own company...
Schuhbart: im having ptsd flashbacks watching george stare as his screen as he tries to write verilog and then decide that its more fun to do random refactoring instead. hits too close to home
twoAze: @yllstar__ give me that job Kappa
j0sheezy: Yeah @yllstar_ is hiring @ mcdonalds, $9.50/hr
smurfd0: i think the fore loop was a pun, since george wrote fore-loops a while back instead of for loop...
Ba6ix: for loops with while loops inside for loops, wtf is this mad genius
UMPS: I swear this man has a new apartment every time I watch his stream
mboumaza: george is so good, the compiler checks if it made a mistake Kappa
yllstar__: its actually $10/hour with meals included. Limited spots for @georgehotz only
nerdyreplicant: @georgehotz I love this.
j0sheezy: in that case, can you say "Piped" Kappa
landwirtskammer: are you a wizard?
dtfo710: That‚Äôs true tho, he‚Äôs always in different places
mboumaza: yeah actually
fyredisco_: can u try a typing test

UMPS: hymen
nerdyreplicant: I got distracted with LVNDMARK. Love the EFT but more interested in this.
LiveCustoms: Geo i bought a new mechanical custom keebs, you jelly?
MrSummer1: Anybody in chat heared about Wyckhoff Accumulation?
UMPS: *wipes mist off face*
Inconnu_xD: @LiveCustoms what switches?
nerdyreplicant: is this a bit more than one man can take as a hobby?
alaouiib: how long is this live actually ?
big_dog_genetics: my boy sweating for a fun project
big_dog_genetics: respect
chatdogy: omg verilog
davr0s: didnt the risc-v people make some custom scala based HDL or something
nerdyreplicant: all those registers
Red_Shift_: how often is verilog used?
Schuhbart: yeah chisel
commandpaul: you can write with default to x0, x0 read is anyway masked.
name100015: big ass case
nerdyreplicant: @commandpaul nice
univ3rsz: hello george!
Schuhbart: the riscv rocket chip is written in chisel, i havent used it myself but it was pleasant to read
big_dog_genetics: if only there was a macro for all that begin/end work
Pepekau: @georgehotz do you think a person that can play chess really well can learn to code really well, too ?
quickcheck: you can‚Äôt put this on an ASIC because it‚Äôs general purpose right?
quickcheck: I‚Äôm a hardware noob
B0Bhead: @Pepekau No. Playing chess really well disqualifies you from coding. Sorry. Please leave this stream now.
Pepekau: Ok, back to learning opening theory
Landepbs: @quickcheck Basically the opposite of an asic, an fpga.
quickcheck: fpgas are fast too, cool
nerdyreplicant: @georgehotz would it be crazy hard to build a basic I/O for an operating system like Linus did?
name100015: comb block
Islandelle: RISC-V can be used to develop cores and processors that contain exactly the instructions needed for a particular application.
otareg: I have mixed feelings about Chisel. It‚Äôs easier to read than Verilog, of course. My unpleasant experience comes from debugging it because the Verilog that was generated from it was basically unreadable
davr0s: yeah they made it easy to extend the ISA with custom instructions for dedicated accelerators
Pepekau: Did anyone here ever take modafinil?
opternary: just joined, what's the goal here?
name100015: Pepekau no LUL
B0Bhead: @opternary learning to read blue letters on a screen
quickcheck: I have @pepekau good stuff
nerdyreplicant: I took the pfizer vaccine today so don't listen to me
opternary: @B0Bhead some kind of ocr?
nerdyreplicant: I'm now all obedient
B0Bhead: @opternary Yes. RISC-V is a very advanced OCR.
nerdyreplicant: still love all the syntax errors
trusteeprisoner: opternary theyre joking look top screen lol
otareg: You can have a default case in the case statement
Red_Shift_: @georgehotz would you say 'quantity over quality' stands for programming? (practice wise)
opternary: @trusteeprisoner yeah i was considering that, but the joke was so bad i just thought it's not a joke
B0Bhead: @opternary wasnt even a joke what
quickcheck: vim coders are sexy change my mind
MiloZeus: as someone that barely knows how to code, vim looks bonkers
trusteeprisoner: why that value for pc? @georgehotz
big_dog_genetics: Were watching Vim Diesel himself in the lab cooking
jb1gly: once you get used to vim, its so much more efficient @MiloZeus - I cant go back to like VS Code
MiloZeus: I've only taken 2 coding courses in uni but I only ever used Xcode
jb1gly: @MiloZeus a lot of this stuff that he's doing though is just bouncing around tmux windows
quickcheck: vim has a bit of a learning curve but just type vimtutor and you‚Äôll get it
big_dog_genetics: Dudes that have everything on default are the most hardcore
opternary: can someone give some insight what's the goal of the code here without trolling/joking?
dicapz: this doesn't look like the coding i do :)
Red_Shift_: @opternary i'd like to know as well :)
quickcheck: if it‚Äôs not that big of a deal use ed
Santiago_LHC: But which chair do you use, and what's your computer, and what shampoo do you use. Tell me all the things I have to have.
nerdyreplicant: Am I crazy or is there some assembler there too
nerdyreplicant: in the thinking
fewlps: My god, i cant understand a single line :(
dillythecoder: @fewlps lol
name100015: cases are usually in combinational blocks
quickcheck: welcome to verilog
dillythecoder: what is he making?
quickcheck: it says at the top of the screen
Santiago_LHC: @dillythecoder Check the giant title on screen
jasondesante: sup George hope you're doing good!
dillythecoder: @dillythecoder yeah idk what that is
dillythecoder: lol
borang: google
Sensat1onaI: google it
Sensat1onaI: jesus christ
nerdyreplicant: imagine it going first time evertytime
big_dog_genetics: that title needs to be red, its not explicit enough
MateusTD: such a helpful chat
MateusTD: so nice
borang: learning to google is more helpful than anything
Santiago_LHC: We don't enable low effort fuckers
nerdyreplicant: looks like me doing music in the mid 90's with Scream Tracker...
aymamoon: is this the pipeline?
big_dog_genetics: this stream aint for the conscious, this is for the mud made monsters
Flotzdrue: many if statments vs loop @georgehotz ?
big_dog_genetics: george bro where that kaiko
nerdyreplicant: of course I'm making funny comments..
name100015: no default = latches
football2442: so it can reduce power consumption in comparison to ARM
ty_b_rekogd: yooo
nerdyreplicant: @georgehotz do you see the unfinished RISC getting input and giving output?
nerdyreplicant: what will you input it?
Schuhbart: @trusteeprisoner the riscv-test repo hes using uses 0x80000000 as the code start in their linker script so he initializes his pc to that. im not sure why that number though
opternary: @Sensat1onaI @borang how title & google can help someone who doesn't program processors/hardware understanding what the goal is here?
dillythecoder: @Sensat1onaI good idea
dillythecoder: LOL SMH
nerdyreplicant: I'm farming chia with 4TB :D
moonlit____: is there really a need for that big title on top of the video?
smurfd0: is it becayuse you wrote the arith in the case statment?
borang: @opternary good luck
poggurt: "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."
poggurt: That's why people tell you to Google
nerdyreplicant: just kidding
JabaliDeOro: Where's my spaguetti code?, ah, there
smurfd0: also why did twitch remove the sub thing next to me?
quickcheck: keep your brain hydrated

dahmerrrr: addition done af
thatsourblood: Yay! Math!
„ÅØ„Å°„Åø„Å§„Éô„Éº„Ç¢: George, what are your thoughts on learning Java?
opternary: @poggurt i did google it, and the only thing I understand is that he's implementing some kind of "core" in RISC-V specification for processors, in VERILOG programming language
MateusTD: addition done, next step conquer the world
quickcheck: 0+24=24
Schuhbart: you dont have a cheap fpga laying around somewhere? things are like 100 bucks
quickcheck: It checks out
football2442: @big_dog_genetics if your planning to game id get a desktop
borang: @opternary, there you go
opternary: @poggurt but that doesn't say nothing about the goal of it
opternary: @borang but what's the goal here, that's my question
name100015: opternary faster instructions executing
big_dog_genetics: im a mech engineer and a fake programmer so im not sure how intensive this gets
big_dog_genetics: no games
opternary: @name100015 thank you
smurfd0: doing things make you learn things... thats the goal :) im guessing
SuggBoat: I'd like to inquiry about the board of keys?
MateusTD: I kinda miss vhdl
Davz: Having fond memories of my CARCH labs w/ vhdl and mips
MateusTD: PogChamp
nerdyreplicant: who is given the permission to code us like this? My if-statements are strange. I'm feeling strange. Who am I?
opternary: @name100015 are the instructions for some specific use case?

big_dog_genetics: @georgehotz i love that youre sweating on a fun project
zybraction: Is that i functional or structural verilog ?
Schuhbart: avoiding stalls from the hazards is where it gets tricky
big_dog_genetics: we go hard on this stream
zybraction: structural verilog is much more difficult then functional
zybraction: In structural verilog, you dont even have if statement
spookyknockknock: It's not functional verilog, its behavioral
directrix13: do you have an FPGA to test this on?
directrix13: nice
ananasfringant: ssup bruh

Santiago_LHC: @WistfulFella it was a dumb and off topic question. The kind of question he never answers
toledo60: normal questions can be googled LUL
boss_uprising: !streamingtime
virtuallynathan: Are there open source RISC-V FPGA implementations you can take and expand?
VanityShowcase: have you ever tried creating a bot to checkout products online?
averageswe: @virtuallynathan GitHub probably has some.
turingsdilemma: @toledo60 Or DuckDuckGo-ed. If you try to learn something new, Google search results spam you with Udemy, Udacity and all kinds of useless stuff.

virtuallynathan: There are several: https://github.com/risclite/SuperScalar-RISCV-CPU
vegemite: do u play runescape george
bottonresult: or do you "expantab"?
directrix13: So why don't you add expandtabs to your .vimrc?
bottonresult: right
virtuallynathan: This one has 3 different implementations: https://github.com/bluespec/Toooba
virtuallynathan: 3 stage, 5 stage in order, superscalar out of order
turingsdilemma: "How big is a tab?". I think a tab is big enough to fit on the computers we have today.

bottonresult: actually there's a expandtab on the .vimrc in his github
JimDeezy: I was workin t1 Apple a couple years ago and a guy got fired cuz he was playin fortnite

directrix13: what is that board?
yodawithagun: RISC V is a new architecture? Or a new chip?
JimDeezy: :O
ShredderSherlock: what is the total streaming time today folks?
aluminum_extruder: whats the float precision
TheXrspy: risc-v has opcode space reserved for custom instructions. Specifically for use in custom accelerator cores basically
virtuallynathan: It probably has ethernet hard IP
averageswe: damn
averageswe: That's sick.
directrix13: RISC V is a relatively new open architecture
averageswe: So you can optimize around that?
skooches: anyone made a bigLITTLE risc that's actually useful yet
trevor403: what do you think of new hdls like migen?
Dreamcuber: AXI is a nice interface that you can attach your own modules too
skooches: AXI sucks lol it's just because it's an open standard
guest1GRjBAYo: when are you gonna get a french fry sponsorship?
Dreamcuber: say you make an accelerator, you can let it talk to the risc-v core through the axi interface
coolcake2: 6 + 7 stage pipeline?
virtuallynathan: Something like CXL2.0 is what you;d want for a full-scale accelerator
yodawithagun: Waiting for the time you test a Cerebres Wafer Scale Engine
averageswe: wat
virtuallynathan: CXL2 is cache coherent across accelerators, etc, so you could use DRAM across the system
JimDeezy: can we download more ROB?
JimDeezy: MiniK
skooches: rob is just a method of ooo exec
JimDeezy: :D :D :D
skooches: there's a few implementations
yodawithagun: Cerebres is a lie. Wuttt!! NotLikeThis  NotLikeThis
skooches: rob is also found alongside a shelving buffer too sometimes
TheXrspy: The ROB allows the CPU to basically build a dynamic dependancy graph of instructions inside the CPU. Instructions that have their values for their source registers calculated can enter the backend execute pipeline. That's how things start to happen out of order.
coolcake2: fight Elon and Janson?

virtuallynathan: Yea, probably so
programmer42: what you guys trying to solve
spookyknockknock: thats CXL
spookyknockknock: look up CCIX
aluminum_extruder: ccix is a scam
virtuallynathan: they are pretty similar tech, CXL is kinda the new one I think
cupcakeboi477: So you are doing your own chips now?
neeeeb1234: what is the favorite project people have worked on
spookyknockknock: It's a layer on top of PCIe

cupcakeboi477: Did you notice that when Tesla had their autonomous day and hekin Adrej Karpathy showed the architecture for their neural network it was AlexNet?
virtuallynathan: @spookyknockknock isn‚Äô t CXL the next phase after CCIX? I thought CCIX was older/dying?
trevor403: what do you think of using QSPI RAM on a CPU? it would reduce pin count haahha
JimDeezy: but how many virtual machines of crysis can it run in the cloud?
cupcakeboi477: Its like Adrej
cupcakeboi477: is it 2012
skooches: look im just tryna get my free interposer from L3
skooches: hook me up
virtuallynathan: So you want Cerebras WSE style ‚Äî magic machine with networking and all kinds of AI power?
virtuallynathan: No general compute onboard?
trevor403: lol so like always go DRAM or SRAM if you don't need much
spookyknockknock: CXL is essentially intel's version of CCIX. Amzn is jumping on CCIX
keiner2: BOOM
cupcakeboi477: BTW dropout in YOLO variants is sooooo hot right now
directrix13: So when are we going to work on compressing GPT3 down to something that can run on a robot that fetches butter?
virtuallynathan: @spookyknockknock huh, I thought like every vendor was onboard for CXL2
spookyknockknock: Their office for CCIX and CXL is essentially the same palce
aluminum_extruder: that sounds like the opposite of fast
yodawithagun: I've only run Slam on Snapdragon 845 and it sucks balls. even Orbslam maxes out at 35fps

kenwise: that sounds like a good idea george
keiner2: Xeon Phi cap
skooches: this is what i was saying "when you want m1 do you mean the whole chip design or just core vs core to risc"
skooches: because that power architecture benefit comes from the stated cores and scheduling on them
JimDeezy: more functional power at smaller scale
spookyknockknock: @lnau Yeah that's to be fancy. You just need an LPU: linear algebra processing using. Its just matrix multiplication
kenwise: seriously why aren't you worth at least like 200m?
kenwise: u don't do startups
skooches: i also feel like people forget apple uses the LITERAL best process of fab in the industry today
cactusvacuum: https://openfive.com/custom-silicon/
skooches: they are ALWAYS on the most modern fab
skooches: and that brings huge benefits
luigivsf: Are you still using mac air m1 for development ?
keiner2: the production node name is just a PR label though
mrcroissant007: plagiarism is just stand on the shoulders of giants
skooches: *picks up phone* yeah up cumchip production to 1000 and dump all of my upcoming 3nm+ into bobSoC
directrix13: are you willing to purchase a batch of a 10,000?
coolcake2: George is gonna write 1 nm on his chip
Dreamcuber: it's all the added stuff in form of patented IP blocks that make ARM cores perform better than a regular pure Risc-V core. If the big companies didn't have that black magic proprietary circuitry, RISC-V would just take over
spookyknockknock: I guarantee you dude, if you crack how to build a accelerator with CXL/CCIX, you'll high probability to take over bro
cactusvacuum: https://scs.sifive.com/core-designer/
kenwise: super computer
keiner2: biglittle is good for mobile though.. longer battery life
trevor403: big endian gang?!!?!
hermitsings: https://www.twitch.tv/danistem for george
trevor403: oh cores
skooches: well if you don't have power requirements do the obvious and just fucking double clock like everyone keeps saying with firestorm.... but beware not being on 5nm
kenwise: y'all nerd out more then your average nerds g
spookyknockknock: The chat is pretty high iq here!!! nice. I like it.
lnau: you need big little tho for battery life
Dreamcuber: Jim Keller Kreygasm
coolcake2: my hommies like Jim Keller
trevor403: I agree biglittle is weird, plus you need the scheduler to be numa aware and decide when to enable cores
mucinoab: jim keller on lex podcast ufff, great stuff
coolcake2: ^
JimDeezy: just rent or get a 120 q bit computer to run remotely with neural net applications problem solved
oMYTHRA: you guys think Pat Gelsinger can turn Intel around?
skooches: i don't think geo is gonna be using his chip on battery somehow
skooches: unless i'm wrong you makin a phone lol??
keiner2: even if he can it'll take years
hamzard1: frontend is in react KAPPA
spookyknockknock: There's not thing better than having top notch science partners cracking tough problems
kenwise: i thought RTFM was a joke
Dreamcuber: So when will we be able to invest in Tenstorrent? I like infinite money glitches.
zNisroc: what fpga do use? i was working on a vc709 for my thesis project
lnau: @kenwise no
lnau: why tho?
keiner2: what about sifive
SurfCat: It's funny because it's true kenwise Keepo
Dreamcuber: B-b-but, Jim Keller!
skooches: uh like qualcomm and that's it
skooches: maybe huawei
skooches: or sammy
kenwise: @Inua manual^‚Å∂ = like 20,000 manual pages
directrix13: I believe Frito-Lay is moving to 5 nanometer chips
coolcake2: Front end is basically VERILOG code, and back end is chip-soecific synthesis, maping to gates, etcc
mrcroissant007: missiles
ShredderSherlock: Jim Keller is married to Jordan Peterson's sister
trevor403: how did Apple even get fab time for that process
sanjarcode: so you're basically studying live. greatüòé
virtuallynathan: Very little is being fabbed on 5nm right now, maybe some high end next gen networking chips
lnau: does it list listening devices per square mm in the spec sheet?
JimDeezy: @directrix13 I think my they‚Äôre under 1nm now actually Kappa
virtuallynathan: 51.2Tbps switch chips, I think
skooches: if you want to know about fabbing and back/front end, systemverilog has a video called "overview of VLSI" which i can recommend
trevor403: oh yeah the new 400Gb nics are on 5nm tech
virtuallynathan: Xilinx is still using 7nm for the Versal FPGAs
spookyknockknock: @virtuallynathan Ah do you wireless stuff? Modem? youre at the q? lol
virtuallynathan: I work on CDN hardware / operations
skooches: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIlwGFcDLhI this one
kenwise: that's a nice pad though g
spookyknockknock: @virtuallynathan whats cdn?
kenwise: looks sharp
virtuallynathan: @spookyknockknock Netflix
skooches: skip to 12min in for actual start if you know how transistors work
JimDeezy: and the execute
virtuallynathan: @spookyknockknock sorry, content delivery network ‚Äî specifically at Netflix
syzo__: oh nice I've been thinking of diving into risc-v shenanigans, well-timed stream
Dreamcuber: #teamVHDL
trevor403: does CDN run on general purpose hardware or mostly smart nics and other special accelerator cards
lnau: yes
lnau: your dedication to renaming is admirable
skooches: CDN runs on fastly downtime
virtuallynathan: At Netflix we use commodity hardware, Intel/AMD, NVMe flash, normal HDDs, we‚Äôre trying TLS offload NICs now
spookyknockknock: @virtuallynathan Ah servers need high speed data transfer? I'm trying see if I can guess the link to CXL
skooches: if i owned fastly i would simply host it on cloudflare, problem solved
virtuallynathan: Yes, we are doing almost 400Gbps from 1U servers
sanjarcode: guys, any advice on how to have start learning hardware? I mean what's the mindset...
trevor403: lmao shared varnish instances too fastly down
kenwise: is a 10700k a good proc?
coolcake2: its mostly fine
spookyknockknock: ahah I see. @virtuallynathan
sanjarcode: I'm an EECS major, but couldn't do hardware. can I do it now...?
skooches: "Hazard Detect" lmfao
lnau: yes two insts
lnau: @kenwise yes
virtuallynathan: The TLS offload NICs are great, the new ones are in-line, so you save all kinds of memory bandwidth. KTLS in Linux/FreeBSD handles all of the low-level stuff
spookyknockknock: Is it not fascinating that now the servers essentially have most of the R&D money??
kenwise: i totally neglected to pay attn to amd chips intel's 10 gen period
skooches: dual issue* *with built in ooo vulnerabilities
kenwise: amd is supposedly better?
lnau: doesnt matter any new chip is going to be good
kenwise: 16 core seems so tempting though
lnau: for what?
coolcake2: @kenwise just get whatever looks like a better deal
kenwise: 16 core is macho
lnau: haha ok
jrozner: there's a 32 and 64 bit variant, isn't there?
lnau: it's a nice power of two i'll give you that
coolcake2: front end is the verilog code?
virtuallynathan: Yea, there are 32/64bit RISC-V variants
kenwise: feel like i got god powering my comp
PythonNoob: send a kiss to brazil
kenwise: btc solar panel ftw
Dreamcuber: @sanjarcode there is an amazing book called "Digital Design Using VHDL: A Systems Approach" written by William Dally, chief scientist at Nvidia.
skooches: you puny little subscalar
lnau: subscalar has less bugs at least :)
mrcroissant007: check out fundamentals of super scalar processors it a good read
kenwise: so you don't like have a party at your house while you hack, george? u know like swordfish...?
cellophane11578: how many subscalars does it take to get to the center of a tootsie roll
skooches: @cellophane11578 CPI < 0.99999
spookyknockknock: haha value extraction there bro? Maybe? lol
lnau: m1 ipad screen is very nice for reading
JimDeezy: @virtuallynathan what like % of the network is commodity hardware?  That surprising and cool
syzo__: gg ez
kenwise: you're obviously enlightened.
trevor403: lmao I'm reading about these new 400gbps nics, they use mult-voltage logic encoding, it reminds me of the ternary voltage CPU designs from the 1970s
JesseSkinner: splurge on printing onto nice paper.. better reading comprehension on paper
skooches: im gonna buy one of the m1 imacs, and power it with a pd power bank, and carry it around by it's stand upside down everywhere and act like it's normal
JimDeezy: I aced my computer architecture class recently :D
kenwise: gratz
JimDeezy: it wasn‚Äôt too in depth tho
spookyknockknock: @virtuallynathan holy moly, looks like most comps went on CXL side
kenwise: what was the manual you read on the subject?
kenwise: so i'll know to avoid
kenwise: or did you cover whole manual?
spookyknockknock: lol even MS is jumping on CXL
zx_ml: D: piracy
spookyknockknock: Dude companies are hungry for more money
lnau: aren't threre risc-v nn accelerators?
spookyknockknock: Big c0mpanies are sometimes like cancer. They suck the blood out of ppl.
lnau: yeah there are extensions at least
lnau: not sure the maturity
lnau: i think there's one on amazon
JimDeezy: Maybe it‚Äôll come full circle @spookyknockknock after maybe like a 5 trillion marker cap maybe it‚Äôll be more human centric then ü§£
SINGED_CAN_FEED_AFRICA: @spookyknockknock cough cough *amazon*

shinigami_29_: Which Macbook are you using? Air or Pro?
spookyknockknock: But when ms/ gets into embedded, embedded is about to get ruined lol
skooches: if you want to see an actual working OOO 64bit risc core, look at SiFive's U84
keiner2: not sure,, sifive is working on this though
kenwise: so what exactly does george specialise in?
SomEviLurker: brb coding my own risc gpu to avoid buying 2000‚Ç¨ rtx
pisa1729: Seriously, thank you so much for the iOS jailbreaks. You made my life with Apple devices beyond incredible
skooches: no lol it costs money but they have lots of research out about it
spookyknockknock: @JimDeezy yeah but @pple make quality product, cares about ppl, etc etc
JimDeezy: Maybe we 5T they can focus more wholey and Amazon on more human-centric capitalism, similar to the industrial revolution running its course
JimDeezy: maybe at*
NatelBeats: big head on the beat

spookyknockknock: Does it not seem like big comps are like cancer?
ROOTRob: one day speculator will buy all the agriculture futures, only for hodl and everyone will starve and finally speculator will be sad
keiner2: speculation just means the instructions are executed but not retired
mrcroissant007: check Design of the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture for dynamic instruction sets
skooches: this one is quite similar to the sifive e76, is a pretty nice design https://opencores.org/projects/biriscv
spookyknockknock: I have no respect saying I work for xxx
JimDeezy: @rootrob was just thinking about this dystopian scenario lol
kenwise: super snitchin ass
skooches: it's superscalar dual but not ooo

d3vaashish: @JimDeezy I guess it's apple M1 chip he did an unboxing video on it recently : )
spookyknockknock: There are couple of fields that has true bandwidth for good clean RT0S. 1)R0b0tics and 2) basic microcontrollers
keiner2: r0b0t1kz y0
spookyknockknock: freeRTOS is a bad RTOS, and amzn bought the "free" rtos
str1ngerrr: how old were you when you stared coding @georgehotz
spookyknockknock: It just show how desperate the market is
spookyknockknock: ms bought something similiar as well
redjazzcat: Looks like you can design hardware in Coq. Thats neat https://github.com/sifive/Kami
spookyknockknock: We need like a clean open source simple RTOS
crazycatz59: does anyone in here know what progress has been made on backspace?
crazycatz59: like backspace.ai
kidinspace: After you solve Autonomous Driving, please make real virtual reality anime style. I am counting on you
spookyknockknock: Building an RTOS is super fun

crazycatz59: can someone tell me exactly what we're doing right now?
kidinspace: @oMYTHRA No one has told me
breadhamandegg: @crazycatz59 iygiygi
spookyknockknock: Make the computers efficient everyday, and making ourselves less efficient smart lol
trevor403: is there a way to trigger on both edges of a signal? I guess you can downsample on a really fast clock?
HoopaUnbounded: !time
trevor403: with always blocks on the same signal?
redjazzcat: I never understood how to translate verilog onto actual hardware.
kidinspace: What is RISC-V core used for?
HoopaUnbounded: nothing till now
charowt: !uptime
HoopaUnbounded: !fpga
spookyknockknock: ThreadX has extensive safety certifications from Technischer √úberwachungsverein (T√úV, English: Technical Inspection Association) and UL (formerly Underwriters Laboratories) and is Motor Industry Software Reliability Association MISRA C compliant.
kidinspace: Are we hacking tesla?
HoopaUnbounded: what fpga board is he using
trevor403: like what's the jump between asic macro blocks and tape out? idk the gates get built and routes in hardware
xuandoo: Hello, my name is islam and I‚Äôm from Egypt. My dream is to be like you while I don‚Äôt know anything about programming and I‚Äôve no idea about what you are doing right now

trevor403: big dual port rams around 4mbit can cost like $50
curlypyoob: thoughts on faraday future?
Bombapil0t: check out Pokemon speedruns @xuandoo
spookyknockknock: chat, anyone know if t3sl@ uses freeRTOS?
theantonioooo: "The Dual Port Block RAM (or DPRAM) configuration behaves exactly the same way as the single port configuration, except you have another port available for reading and writing data"
charowt: where is he at now
kemzeb: @spookyknockknock Found a vid at some conference discussing its use if it helps: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KX_0c9R4Fng&t=527s

pedro_rondon: tnks for inspiring us George, is this coding session related to comma/open pilot or just for fun?
guanxicast: What is the "fence" instruction that was on the screen a minute ago? Is it something other than a memory barrier fence? Or is there actual concurrency here?
spookyknockknock: @virtuallynathan What else is new/exciting in sever world?
spookyknockknock: There's also GenZ
Morocco0: @alonssoc u know its not good for ur eyes, right?
Morocco0: dont mind me PixelBob
devj0n: idk why I love his streams even though I have no idea whats going on 99% of time
devj0n: well, 95%
spookyknockknock: How are you going to do RTL level debugging from terminal...
guanxicast: He could compile the verilog to minecraft redstone and fly around the CPU as it runs.
guanxicast: https://github.com/itsFrank/MinecraftHDL
keiner2: that's the preferred way, yes
keiner2: Intel does it like that as well, that's why it takes so many people to make a CPU work
spookyknockknock: I've never seen anyone else to do terminal level verilog coding
spookyknockknock: Oh btw there's a new effect to create a FPGA level kernel
NatelBeats: bless ya
ShredderSherlock: bless you
fugebin: bless you
Morocco0: bless you

Morocco0: Hiiiii
guanxicast: Running Linux eBPF on an FPGA implementation would be kind of cool. On one of those $10k FPGA NICs.
spookyknockknock: @guanxicast what's eBFP
DrKnight22: soooo anyone have the beginner level notes on this?
guanxicast: Interesting link I have never seen stuff on multiplexing FPGA resources securely between users.
guanxicast: eBPF is a bytecode VM inside Linux for semi arbitrary code execution at arbitrary points in the kernel.
spookyknockknock: @guanxicast Yeah, it's spacial based OS... the concept of "time sharing" is miminized
DrKnight22: are you writing this to an actual chip or is it just simulating it?
crazycatz59: @DrKnight22 he has an actual fpga
spookyknockknock: lol python engineer "omg we're writing to a chip" lol you always have been
spookyknockknock: I l0ve python engineers
DrKnight22: very very cool. this is the firmware dev i want to get into
spookyknockknock: You're gonna spend a lot of time debugging this cuz you have no eyes into the chip
guanxicast: The nice simulators are hella proprietary and expensive if you are not actually doing it professionally.
spookyknockknock: You need rtl
spookyknockknock: lets see lets see lets see lol
mero_1181: Hey George, why do you need a full RiscV core? Can‚Äôt you just implement a matrix multiplier in the FPGA outright?
SleeveMcDichael22: eigenvalues
DrKnight22: i need a good starting point. was going to dig into c... then this goat wrote this in python lol
Khemyst: How hot is the FPGA getting during the simulation it is running now?
spookyknockknock: Dude you need RTL
pedro_rondon: @mero_1181 the name of the folder of the project is named for fun XD
Santiago_LHC: YAY
JAKWAI: GG
iamfurynation: bad ass!
spookyknockknock: Nice!! didn't think it would make it
Santiago_LHC: https://github.com/geohot/twitchcore
DrKnight22: wow you added a lot to that project
mero_1181: @pedro_rondon yeah‚Ä¶ I get that. I should have said: isn‚Äôt a matrix multiplier faster than a full RiscV core?
spookyknockknock: Has anyone else seen terminal based verilog dev?
spookyknockknock: This is creative & new to me
guanxicast: Well you could have vector instructions to make matrix ops as fast.
DrKnight22: did you make that board in-house?
pedro_rondon: @spookyknockknock jajajaja XD
spookyknockknock: SVM with a FPGA level kernel function would be nice too
coolcake2: @georgehotz is that HM chair any good?
skooches: its a chair
spookyknockknock: Embedded systems have had FPGA chips along with a CPU for ages lol
spookyknockknock: @spookyknockknock Why it's funny
spookyknockknock: The GAL & PAL chips are really cool too
spookyknockknock: It really shows we have bunch really smart analog ppl
spookyknockknock: I look forward analog engineers to wipe out digital nonsense in about 10 years
skooches: @spookyknockknock lol funny sand make calculator
spookyknockknock: @skooches what's a sand make?
