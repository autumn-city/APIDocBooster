Max pooling does not dilute the location of the maximum pixel - instead consider it as a way of downsizing.  Max pooling is just a way to reduce dimensionality of the problem such that your problem fits into device memory. A nice side property is that it pools the strongest acitvations from your feature map.
If max-pooling is done over a 2x2 region, 3 out of these 8 possible configurations will produce exactly the same output at the convolutional layer.  For max-pooling over a 3x3 window, this jumps to 5/8.
Max pooling does nothing more than iterate over the input image and get the maximum over the current "subimage". 
Max pooling decreases the dimension of your data simply by taking only the maximum input from a fixed region of your convolutional layer. 
 And if you are familiar with Max pooling, then you know this is going to cut our image dimensions in half.
