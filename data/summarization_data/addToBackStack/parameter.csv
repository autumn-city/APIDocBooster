"However, the 'name' used in addToBackStatck(name) is used to control to which fragment you want to pop the fragment back stack by calling popBackStatck/Immediate(name, flags).  So if I have a fragment stack with named fragments: A, B, C and D with A at the bottom. When you call popBackStack(B, XXX_EXCLUSIVE), then your fragment back stack will be like: A and B after the call. Without the name, you can't do that."
Passing null to addtoBackStack(null) means adding the fragment in the Fragment Stack but not adding any TAG which could be further use to identify the particular fragment in a stack before adding again. 
But passing TAG to addToBackStack helps in identifying the fragment in Fragment stack by TAG. 
"Just want to clarify, the 'name' used in addToBackStack(name) can't be used for retrieving the fragment by calling fragmentManager.findFragmentByTag(tag).  The 'tag' is different from the 'name'."
