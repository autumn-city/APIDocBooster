ContextWrapper is really useful to work around device/version specific problems or to apply one-off customizations to components such as Views that require a context. 
So although this (for Activity) and getBaseContext() both give the activity context, they  (a) do not refer to the same object (this != getBaseContext()) and  (b) calling context through this is slightly less efficient, as the calls go through an extra level of indirection. 
That was from a post on the [android-developers newsgroup (hyper-link)], you may want to consider asking your question there as well, because a handful of the people working on Android actual monitor that newsgroup and answer questions. 
ContextWrapper is really powerful because it lets you override most functions provided by Context including code to access resources (e.g.  openFileInput(), getString()), interact with other components (e.g. sendBroadcast(), registerReceiver()), requests permissions (e.g. checkCallingOrSelfPermission()) and resolving file system locations (e.g. getFilesDir()).
Android provides a ContextWrapper class that is created around an existing Context using:
