Please note, that Math.floor rounds to the next integer towards minus infinity and thus gives a different result when applied to negative numbers.
Does it have any advantages over doing Math.floor?
[http://jsperf.com/or-vs-floor/2 (hyper-link)] seems slightly faster
Odd Comparative behavior: Math.floor(NaN) === NaN, while (NaN | 0) === 0
This is truncation as opposed to flooring.
Howard's answer is sort of correct; But I would add that Math.floor does exactly what it is supposed to with respect to negative numbers.
Mathematically, that is what a floor is.
Math.floor works with this in mind.
Bitwise operations don't "floor".
Once you go around to negative numbers, Math.floor rounds down while bitwise start rounding up.
As I said before, Math.floor is safer because it operates with 64bit floating numbers.

Add -lm to your link options, since pow() and floor() are part of the math library:
For example, man pow and man floor will both tell you:
You can see that this was compiled without an error, but pow, floor, and printf functions have undefined references, now if I will try to link this to executable:
To solve that, I need to tell linker where to look for references to pow, and floor, for this purpose I will use linker -l flag with m which comes from libm.so library.
You can now see, functions pow, floor are linked to GLIBC_2.2.5.
EDIT:  Because the question may have been modified due to confusion between fabs() and floor().
floor() will truncate toward negative infinite.
The rule is that int rounds towards 0, while floor rounds towards negative infinity.
On my system, I've timed that casting is at least 3 times faster than floor.
I have code that needs the floor operation of a limited range of values, including negative numbers.
But I've clocked it to be at least 3 times faster than floor, which was really critical for our application.
As others have pointed out, casting to an integer will truncate towards zero, whereas floor() will always truncate towards negative infinity; this is different behaviour for a negative operand.
You'd be much better off using
np.floor(series) directly, as suggested by several other answers.
You could do something like this using NumPy's floor, for instance, with a dataframe:
You can use NumPy's built in methods to do this: np.ceil(series) or np.floor(series).
With [pd.Series.clip (hyper-link)], you can set a floor via clip(lower=x) or ceiling via clip(upper=x):
applying and flooring a ceiling simultaneously, e.g.
It's not floor that rounds, it's floating point math that does.
your floor() function has nothing to do with this behavior
This can work for float without expanding to double, but I'm not sure how easy it is to make floor work.
Anyway, the obvious solution here is _mm256_floor_ps() and _mm256_cvtps_epi32 (vroundps and vcvtps2dq).
I'm not sure if we can do even better; If you had a huge array to process (and couldn't manage to interleave this work with other work), you could set the MXCSR rounding mode to "towards -Inf" (floor) and simply use vcvtps2dq (which uses the current rounding mode).
So there's room for the possibility of magic-number tricks being a win in some cases; it maybe worth investigating if _mm256_floor_ps() + cvt are part of a critical bottleneck (or more likely if you have double and want int32).
@Cássio Renan's int foo = floorf(f) will actually auto-vectorize if compiled with gcc -O3 -fno-trapping-math (or -ffast-math), with -march= something that has SSE4.1 or AVX.
This is broader than just an integer flooring issue:
Floor division with // never has the problem, because it's a purely int-based division (nothing is ever represented as a float), and ints are (to the limits of computer memory) effectively infinite precision.
Note that when you are flooring by the second, you will often get an arithmetic overflow if you use 0.
So pick a known value that is guaranteed to be lower than the datetime you are attempting to floor.
In 2005, you can use the messier floor: cast(floor(cast(getdate() as float)) as datetime)
I've used [@Portman's answer (hyper-link)] many times over the years as a reference when flooring dates and have moved its working into a function which you may find useful.
i solved the problem, all of the conditions are given by professor however she made a logical mistake if you do the problem by hand you get
5|S
4|F
3|M
2|C
1|B
as you can see if you go by rules in the end the only plase an S can live is floor 5 but that fails one of the rules so i will tel the prof that she made a mistake as far as prolog code goes i did it like this
This can lead to confusing results: for
  example, floor((0.1+0.7)*10) will usually return 7 instead of the
  expected 8, since the internal representation will be something like
  7.9999999999999991118….

This can lead to confusing results: for
  example, floor((0.1+0.7)*10) will usually return 7 instead of the
  expected 8, since the internal representation will be something like
  7.9999999999999991118....
And we can see why your floor takes it from 28.9999999999 etc down to 28, instead of the integer 29 to 29.
That's because there is no 0.4 in python (floating-point finite representation) it's actually a float like 0.4000000000000001 which makes the floor of division to be 19.
Read more about [pythons integer division floors (hyper-link)] by Guido himself.
Then the floored division is executed, and because
I.e., it seems floored division is determined atomically (but on the only approximate float values of the interpreted float literals).
Only then, the floor operation is performed, but now acting on exactly 20.0, thus not changing the number any more.
For the floor division, something else happens.
Internally, float_floor_div (line 654) gets called, which then calls float_divmod, a function that is supposed to return a tuple of python floats containing the floored division, as well as the mod/remainder, even though the latter is just thrown away by PyTuple_GET_ITEM(t, 0).
The result for the floored division is calculated by effectively computing floor((numerator - mod) / denominator)
Therefore, the result that is computed is actually floor((8.0 - 0.4) / 0.4) = 19 and snapping (8.0 - 0.4) / 0.4) = 19 to the nearest integral value does not fix the error made introduced by the "wrong" result of fmod.
I would guess, that they chose this way of computing the floored division to keep the validity of (numerator//divisor)*divisor + fmod(numerator, divisor) = numerator (as mentioned in the link in @0x539's answer), even though this now results in a somewhat unexpected behavior of floor(8.0/0.4) != 8.0//0.4.
For unsigned and non-negative signed values, this is the same as floor (rounding towards -Infinity).
Will result always be the floor of the division?
It rounds toward 0, rather than flooring.
Where the result is negative, C truncates towards 0 rather than flooring - I learnt this reading about why Python integer division always floors here: [Why Python's Integer Division Floors (hyper-link)]
Will result always be the floor of the division?
To make it clear floor rounds towards negative infinity,while integer division rounds towards zero (truncates)
You cannot simplify floor(x+y) for fractional x and y, but if you know that x is an integer, then floor(x+y) = x + floor(y)
You can also simplify floor(floor(x/a)/b) over integers
Thus floor(floor(x/a)/b) = floor( x/(a*b) ) over positive integers.
Floor(-3,-2)
Try this Floor(-3,-4) gives 0.
FLOOR function - Rounds a number down, toward zero
FLOOR.PRECISE function - Rounds a number down to the nearest integer or to the nearest multiple of significance.
If number is positive and significance is negative, FLOOR returns the #NUM!
If you use the command break FLOOR::FLOOR, followed by run and then you can print out the file name when it breaks, you can see what file name your program is trying to open.
floor() value rounded to the next lowest integer.
The return value of floor() is still of type float because the value range of float is usually bigger than that of integer.
This can lead to confusing results: for
  example, floor((0.1+0.7)*10) will usually return 7 instead of the
  expected 8, since the internal representation will be something like
  7.9999999999999991118....
floor returns a double while a / b where both a and b are integers yields an integer value.
floor(a/b) does the same division, converts the result to double, discards the (nonexistent) fractional part, and returns the result as a double.
The problem is that in floating-point, a rounding occurs in the division a/b, so that the floor function doesn't apply on the exact rational value, but on an approximate value.
In short, the result I've obtained is that if a - b is exactly representable in the floating-point system, then floor(a/b), where a and b are floating-point numbers (with integer values), gives the same result as the integer division a/b.
floor() is a function.
Probably floor() is already optimized.
A couple of things make floor slower than a cast and prevent vectorization.
floor can modify the global state.
Detecting these problematic conditions is not simple and makes up more than 90% of the execution time of floor.
Also It's a lot of code, so inlining the whole floor-function would make your program run slower.
Btw - You can roll your own floor-function using simple casts.
Yes, floor() is extremely slow on all platforms since it has to implement a lot of behaviour from the IEEE fp spec.
I sometimes use a macro to approximate floor():
It does not behave exactly as floor(): for example, floor(-1) == -1 but PSEUDO_FLOOR(-1) == -2, but it's close enough for most uses.
If you are going to convert the result of the floor() operation to an int, and if you aren't worried about overflow, then the following code is much faster than (int)floor(x):
Branch-less Floor and Ceiling (better utilize the pipiline) no error check
or using floor
On 64-bit platforms, the original code using int64_t intermediate value will result in three instruction kernel, the same available for int32_t reduced range floor/ceil, where |x| < 0x40000000 --
change the MXCSR FP rounding mode to round towards -Infinity (aka floor).
(With the right compiler options, like -fno-math-errno, and the right -march or -msse4 options, compilers can inline floor using roundps, or the scalar and/or double-precision equivalent, e.g.
Actually, gcc8.2 will inline roundsd for floor even without any fast-math options, [as you can see on the Godbolt compiler explorer (hyper-link)].
-5.0 to +5.0, then it will be quicker to repeatedly add/subtract 1.0 until you get within range, rather than calling expensive functions such as floor.
If the range of values that may occur is sufficiently small, perhaps you can binary-search the floor value.
I make no guarantees about this - I don't know how the efficiency of comparisons compares with floor - but it may be worth trying.
Use this to find the floor (wipe bits below the point) to avoid renormalising issues.
If enabled it should make most math functions faster (including floor).
If you are looping and using u and v as index coordinates, instead of flooring a float to get the coordinates, keep both a float and int of the same value and increment them together.
The reason why floor() is so slow is because it changes global state if the cast would overflow (FLT_MAX does not fit in a scalar integer type of any size), which also makes it impossible to vectorize unless you disable strict IEEE-754 compatibility, which you should probably not rely on anyway.
(int)(x+16.0)-16.0 is so bad I won't even touch it, but your method is also wrong because it gives floor(-1) as -2.
Branches can cause a cache miss, which will completely negate any increase in performance; also, if math errno is disabled, then casting to int is the biggest remaining bottleneck of any floor() implementation.
I'd recommend SVG solely because you will be able to get off the ground developing it much much faster for a floor-plan type of app.
floor is spelt int in perl:
floor isn't a built-in operator in Perl
The [POSIX (hyper-link)] module also has a floor function and should be installed as part of Perl so you can use that by writing use POSIX 'floor' instead.
Alternatively you can write your own floor subroutine in terms of the built-in operator int
If the result of floor() isn't exactly representable, what do you expect the value of d to be?

floor(3 + 0.5) is not a very good example, because 3, 0.5, and their sum are all exactly representable in any real-world floating point format.
floor(0.1 + 0.9) would be a better example, and the real question here is not whether the result of floor is exactly representable, but whether inexactness of the numbers prior to calling floor will result in a return value different from what you would expect, had all numbers been exact.
I invite others to criticize this approach if it's bad, but one possible workaround might be to multiply your number by (1.0+0x1p-52) or something similar prior to calling floor (perhaps using nextafter would be better).
Your character glides across the holes and pits in your floor because the bounding box encapsulates those holes and pits.
You might have an easier time constructing your floor out of several convex shapes (instead of a single concave shape) and using hitTestObject on each of them.
This seems to work (needs no import and works using the // operator which should be faster than numpy, as it simply returns the floor of the division):
Neither Python built-in nor numpy's version of ceil/floor support precision.
The inner floor is redundant
If x is an integer then the inner floor is redundant.
The outer floor is not redundant.
floor(sqrt(floor(2))) = floor(sqrt(2)) = floor(1.41...)
Without the outer floor the result would be 1.41...
Obviously the outer floor is not redundant, since for example, sqrt(2) is not an integer, and thus floor(sqrt(2))≠sqrt(2).
It is also easy to see that sqrt(floor(x))≠sqrt(x) for non-integer x.
We need to find out whether or not floor(sqrt(floor(x)))==floor(sqrt(x)) for all rationals (or reals).
Therefor floor(sqrt(n))=floor(sqrt(n+eps)) for all 0<eps<1 and integer n. Assume otherwise that floor(sqrt(n))=m and floor(sqrt(n+eps))=m+1, and you've got a case where sqrt(n)<m+1 however sqrt(n+eps)>=m+1.
So, assuming the outer floor is needed, the inner floor is redundant.
It is easy to see that floor(sqrt(n)) ≠ floor(sqrt(ceil(n))).
The inner floor is redundant.
Assume the inner floor is not redundant.
for some x and d where floor(x) = floor(x+d).
Then we have three numbers to consider:
a = sqrt(x), b = floor(sqrt(x+d)), c = sqrt(x+d).
Therefore floor(x) < b^2, and b^2 <= floor(x+d), and then floor(x) < floor(x+d).
But we started by assuming floor(x) = floor(x+d).
We've reached a contradiction, so our assumption is false, and the inner floor is redundant.
The inner one is redundant, because the square root for any number in the interval [x,x+1[ (where x is an integer) always lies within the interval [floor(sqrt(x)),ceil(sqrt(x))[ and therefore you don't need to floor a number before taking the square root of it, if you are only interested the integer part of the result.
If the inner floor were not redundant, then we would expect that  floor(sqrt(n)) != floor(sqrt(m)), where m = floor(n)
floor(sqrt(n)) != floor(sqrt(m)) requires that the values of sqrt(n) and sqrt(m) differ by at least 1.0
thus, for all values n, the floor(sqrt(n)) == floor(sqrt(n + 1)).
Thus the inner floor is redundant.
n <= sqrt(x) < n+1, so floor(sqrt(x)) = n;
n^2 <= floor(x) < (n+1)^2, so n <= sqrt(floor(x)) < n+1, so floor(sqrt(floor(x))) = n.
Therefore, floor(sqrt(floor(x))) = floor(sqrt(x)), which implies the inner floor is redundant.
floor takes a Double and returns another Double.
If you want it to be an Int (to match self.maxViewers, you must convert it explicitly: Int(floor(viewSize / itemSize)).
Here is a new implementation, reflecting that you should not store any value below the floor :
It is not a bug in floor.Check the result of %
This number is very close to 29, but floor truncates it to 28 anyway.
This means that sometimes a number will be a little more or less than you expect; floor will not take this into consideration, and thus 0.29 will internally be represented as 0.28999999... and rounded down to 0.28.
A simple solution is to add a very small number, such as [numeric_limits<double>::epsilon() (hyper-link)], before calling std::floor:
You can easily use Math.floorDiv() method.
If b and c are integers, b / c is already the floor division.
If they are float64s, use math.Floor(b/c).
If using float32 (or any other numeric type), you must convert first: math.Floor(float64(b)/float64(c))
Multipled that by 100 and truncated with floor() results in your 31095.0000
Ceil : cast ( x as int ) + ( x > cast ( x as int ))
Take integer part of x and add 1 if decimal value is greater than 0
Floor : cast ( x as int ) - ( x < cast ( x as int ))
Take integer part of x and subtract 1 if decimal value is less than 0
Ceil :
SELECT (cast ( amount as int ) + ( amount > cast ( amount as int ))) AS amount
FROM SALES WHERE id = 128;
Floor :
SELECT (cast ( amount as int ) - ( amount < cast ( amount as int ))) AS amount
FROM SALES WHERE id = 128;
I have checked all the corner cases including negative number with MySQL ceil() and floor() functions.
You can use ROUND() to the effect of CEIL and FLOOR if you add or subtract 0.5 from the number on hand.
Ceil : SELECT ROUND(amount+0.5, 0) AS amount FROM SALES WHERE id = 128;
Floor : SELECT ROUND(amount-0.5, 0) AS amount FROM SALES WHERE id = 128;
floor(x) is the largest integer not greater than x.
One thing that can confuse people is the floor of a negative value.
Some might initially think that floor(-3.4) is -3 when in reality it is -4 by the definition of floor(x).
As a note, floor(x) is often written as [image].
floor(3.4): 3
floor(-3.4): -3 - 1 = -4
Btw for the moment the "double to string -> string to double -> floor" solution seems to be the only one giving exactly the expected result.
Make the number a variable and use floor on the variable it looks ok.

So, although you could do floor on GPU, you cannot do it in atomic sections.
use round() instead of floor()
CEIL and FLOOR only remove decimals - specifically rounding to integer value.
And the same for floor.
Basically you have to divide it by the desired rounding level, round the rest with ceil/floor, and then multiply back.
The // operator explicitly floors the result.
the result is that of mathematical division with the ‘floor’ function applied to the result.
Flooring is not the same thing as rounding to 0; flooring always moves to the lower integer value.
See the [math.floor() function (hyper-link)]:
Return the floor of x, the largest integer less than or equal to x.
Flooring then moves to the lower integer value, so -2.
Floor division will also round down to the next lowest number, not the next lowest absolute value.
// in Python is a "floor division" operator.
That means that the result of such division is the floor of the result of regular division (performed with / operator).
The floor of the given number is the biggest integer smaller than the this number.
For negative numbers it is less intuitive: -7 / 2 = -3.5, so -7 // 2 = floor of -3.5 = -4.
Similarly -1 // 10 = floor of -0.1 = -1.
// is defined to do the same thing as math.floor(): return the largest integer value less than or equal to the floating-point result.
A useful way to understand why floor division // yields the results it does for negative values is see this as complimenting the modulo, or remainder, % operator.
Although poi.attraction does seem to turn off the name of the museum, just not the floorplan
ok after a bit more experimentation, here's what I settled with.... set all colours to grey (or whatever colour you want the floor plans to be) in the first style, then re-colour everything you want in the following styles.
This results in the floor plans appearing as a single block of colour.
With integer math, there is no need to use the floor function.
This also has the same effect as the floor function.
You are missing a return on this line in the floor function:
The floor function from cmath is an heritage from C, it was here before C++ proposed a long double version of floor... Now we can't remove it as it's used, so the new one was created in std.
floor(ans+0.5) will cast (ans + 0.5) to a 'normal' double, hence the loss of precision.

floor(ans+0.5) will cast (ans + 0.5) to a 'normal' double, hence the loss of precision.
Place those on the floor one after another so that no gap appears and they all form a nice repeating ground.
As your character moves forward check its position on X axis (or whatever axis you want to move on) and if the position is greater than position of your last plane on the floor - some distance than update floor as follows:
floor is correct;
If it is rounded it will become 2 and if floor operation is done on this it will become 1 as  floor() function in C++ returns the largest possible integer value which is less than or equal to the given argument.
If the division log(25.0/9.0)/log(5.0/3.0) is treated as float it will result in 2.0000000039152304 (treating each operand as float and storing result in double for understanding) hence in this case round and floor operation will have same result that is 2.
I was using floor function and its returning its different value.
After a little bit of google search I found this following formula to calculate floor value of a/b.
floor = (a/b) + ((a%b)!=0)
The easiest solution to find the transform for a given camera positioning may be to simply put known markers on the floor at {0,0,0}, {1,0,0}, {0,1,0} and see where they pop up in your camera.
Then Find the projection of your head point to the floor plane
([example (hyper-link)])
Finally, you can convert it to the floor coordinate system or just
keep it in the camera system
Unfortunately, schema.org doesn't have a property for secondary address line, which is where the floor number would go.
Perhaps you could put floor number in streetAddress, on a new line using a <br> tag.
Simply cast it in terms of Reals, solve it (there is a decision procedure for Reals), and then add the extra constraint that the result is an integer by saying Floor(solution) = solution.
One solution would be to have people walk around and take wifi measurements at different places on each floor, then you can store this, and then you can tell where they are on that particular floor.
The wifi approach isn't foolproof but if you take multiple measurements by stair entrances and elevators you should get a good idea when they change floors, and perhaps have some people able to correct the database if they know they are in a particular grid but the app tells them it is somewhere else, so you can start to get a fuzzy idea where people are.
As far as I know, Floor is a quite new.
I am using Floor at the moment for its simplicity.
There is a good technical explanation in moor FAQ comparing Moor with Floor and plus another alternatives:
Floor also has a lot of convenience features like auto-updating
queries and schema migrations.
Then, you have write queries in
sql - the mapping code if generated by floor.
A difference between these two is that Floor let’s you write your own
classes and generates mapping code around that.
For me seems like Floor is more close to Hibernate mainly in the way that Entities were created, just make a comparison between their Entities sintaxe, therefore I found it more familiar and have choose Floor despite it's very new yet.
For those that are looking to DateTime converters both Floor and Moor already support it.
Floor added it since version 0.17: [https://github.com/vitusortner/floor#type-converters (hyper-link)]
In case you just need to concern about android/ios I will recommend you to try Floor, mainly because his sintaxe is really very good.
I have started implementation of Floor and ran into a major snag -- it doesn't support DateTime.
Floor is an alternative of [Android Room (hyper-link)] for flutter
Moor supports DateTime, Floor does not...
Floor has been vacillating around how to do this - providing type converters - for over a year, and we couldn't wait, so rewrote our repository code form Floor to Moor.
I think that the category bit mask of your floor and the collision bitmask of your cube should be the same
you can do so (in swift) like this:
The question does not make sense: floor and ceil round a floating number to an integer.
Since BigInteger values are integers, I assume that you want the the ceiling and floor of division operations.
In the MathContext, you can specify the rounding mode as ceiling or floor (among others).
Print the value of dollars to see what is actually stored before you try to floor the value.
Using floor() is a poor choice to separate 4.2 into an whole number and fraction when the number needs to be rounded to the nearest 0.01.
I haven't completely figured out the specific scenarios (maybe it's only when you add a floor to your scene).
But then add a floor, and it fails.
This transition code does NOT fail on my iPad Air 2 without a "floor" element in "ship.scn" (although it doesn't seem to do anything).
But when you drag an empty "floor" element to the "ship.scn" scene, and rerun, then it fails with the error you noted above.
The reason the quotients in your test case are not equal is that in the math.floor(a/b) case, the result is calculated with floating point arithmetic (IEEE-754 64-bit), which means there is a maximum precision.
Euclidean division) vs the floor of a floating-point division (better term than "regular division"), I studied this problem in 2005.
What I proved is that for rounding to nearest in radix 2, if x−y is exactly representable, then the floor of the floating-point division x/y, i.e.
math.floor(x/y), is equal to the integer division.
[floor() (hyper-link)] will simply drop decimal value and return only integer.
So floor(1.2) => 1 and floor(1.9) => 1.
[floor() (hyper-link)] will always remove the values after the decimal, and only rounds down.
Example 1:
round(1.5) returns 2 while floor(1.5) returns 1.
Example 2:
Both round(3.2) and floor(3.2) return 3.
Example 3:
round(2.9) returns 3 while floor(2.9) returns 2.
If you want you can provide your own floor overload to be found via ADL ¹
I am edit answer with @DanielF explanation:
"floor doesn't convert to integer, it just gives integer-valued floats, so you still need an astype to change to int"
Check this code to understand the solution:
There are many overloaded form of [Math.Floor (hyper-link)]
[Math.Floor(Double) (hyper-link)]
[Math.Floor(Decimal) (hyper-link)]
Just use Math.Floor.
It rounds towards negative infinity, as does the C++ floor.
More importantly, the term floor is defined to always behave as you describe.
See wikipedia for details on the [mathematical floor function (hyper-link)]
.Is there a possibility that floor results in a integer?
[Math.floor (hyper-link)] is declared to return a double, and so will never return something with a static type of int.
Casting to a long keeps the whole portion of the double making it the same as Math.floor for values which can be represented as a long.
Flooring that number will obviously give you 146.
floor doesn't have anything to do with your surprise.
floor simply returns a (possibly) different value when called with different input.
So when you floor it, you turn it into 146.
In addition to the other answers about the imprecision of floating point representation of decimal and fractional numbers, floor() is also the wrong choice when calculating a decimal representation to a  number of significant digits of a floating-point number.
As far as is can see your grass game object is the floor.
If he is standing on top the solution to  your problem could be placing a plane underneath the grass and simply attach a box collider to it so it can function as a floor.
You won't see the plane and you can walk through your grass without falling through the floor anymore.
Then, is there some way to exploit floorL,floorR to achieve the wanted result?
I took your image and loaded it in [Draw SVG (hyper-link)] to create the required top floor <polyline>.
The code is now a HTML page using an SVG file with the OPs image and showing how to use an <a> with some demo text on :hover (top floor again).
Now you create the other floors....
which means that math.floor(math.log(1000,10)) will indeed result in 2
Because of this you can just add your SCNFloor instance as a child of the passed in node and it will render in the correct position, there is no need to set the position explicitly as you are doing above.
For example, the code below works for me, rendering a SCNFloor at the initially detected size of the plane and renders a box that will sit exactly on top of it.
The plane is accurately placed on the floor (or whatever horizontal surface you detect):
There are 500 floor plans (in the form of images) available here:

I would suggest using SVG for drawing the shapes in the floor plan.
You will also most likely need to build a backend that stores the floor plan data in a database and exposes it to the frontend.
When you call floor it gives you exactly 99 because that's what floor(99.9999999) actually should generate, the answer of 100 was the result of rounding, the result of floor is correct for the number you're using.
You don't know it, but you're telling SpriteKit to apply collisions from the cannonballs to the labels, and from the blocks to the floor!
Are floor plans typically a lot larger then logos ( in either file size or image dimensions )?
Do floor plans have less colors then a logo?
All the floor plans I've seen they are pretty monochromatic, I think you can play with the number of colors and color saturation to have a pretty good guess is the image is a logo or a floor plan.
: is the image has less than 2 or 3 colors is a floor plan.
: if the sum / average of the saturation is less than X it's a floor plan.
Black and white (and other similar colors that are used in floor plans) have a saturation that is zero, or very close to zero, while logos tend to be more visually attractive, hence use more saturated colors.
Using only these examples, I would say the image is a floor plant if the average saturation is less than 0.03 or 0.035, you can tweak it a little further by adding extra examples.
Is there not a point in your website's workflow where it could be determined manually whether an image is a logo or a floor plan?
A large (both in terms of MB and dimensions) image is likely to be a floorplan.
Logos are more likely to be JPG, PNG or GIF, floorplans are possibly going to be TIFF or other lossless format - but that's no guarantee.
One of the first things that comes to mind is the fact that floor plans tend to have considerably more lines oriented at 90 degrees than any normal logo would.
If you see a very strong correspondence for Theta=(0, 90, 180, 270) summed over rho, you can classify the image as a floor plan.
What if I choose a floorplan as my company's logo?
But before you can do that, you need to label a small subset of the images, giving it either -1 (a floor plan) or 1 (a logo).
if an image has more keypoints classified as a floor plan then it must be a floorplan, if it has more keypoints classified as a logo then it must be a logo.
Write a PHP script to display one of your images and prompt the user to sort it as either a "logo" our "floorplan."
One-instruction floor/ceil is only available with SSE4.1 roundsd / roundpd, and only for XMM not legacy x87.
The available rounding modes are nearest-even (default), towards +Inf (ceil), towards -Inf (floor), and towards zero (trunc).
Of course if you want (int)floor(x) then definitely just fistp with the rounding mode set as desired.
floor == trunc for non-negative values so you could take advantage of efficient fisttp or SSE XMM truncation for that case.
With SSE4.1, roundsd + cvtsd2si is your best bet for (int)floor(x).
And you are looking for floor(4), then
Because floor(-14.000000000000002) is indeed -15!
You see, floor is defined as the maximal whole number less or equal to the argument.

In jq 1.6 you have access to round/ceil/floor functions
Floor:
Note that both jq 1.5 and 1.6 have builtins named round, ceil, floor and trunc: they are all 0-arity filters.
jq 1.4 has floor but not the other three.
Some builds may lack those functions, but as far as I'm concerned floor is widely available; so, you can implement them using it.
Then, you can define the position of each Regal and its Size, within the limit of the Floor Plan and Max/min Regal Size.
Assume WLOG that v is positive (if v were negative, we could swap ceil and floor in the following analysis).
then v is an integer, and so ceil(v) = floor(v) = v, and so both are trivially representable.
then v is in the range [0,1), and so floor(v) = 0, which is representable, and ceil(v) is either zero or one, both of which are representable.
then floor(v) is just:
because we have thrown away at least one fractional bit, floor(v) has at most k-1 significant bits, and the same exponent as v, so it is representable.
If v is an integer, then ceil(v) = floor(v) = v, so ceil(v) is representable.
Otherwise, ceil(v) = floor(v) + 1, and so also has at most k-1 significant bits and is also representable.
You can call int() on the float to cast to the lower int (not obviously the floor but more elegant)
Alternatively call int on the floor result.
Beware that taking the floor and casting to an int are not the same thing with negative numbers.
If you really want the floor as an integer, you should cast to an int after calling math.floor().
I would divide the given integer by 10,000.0 (with type cast to float), then floor and then multiply by 10.000 (with type cast to integer).
Maybe your language cuts the decimals when you divide integers, than you may spare the casting and flooring and just divide and multiply.
Or to use floor function with a trick:
Why don't you take the floor first, then mod, ie.
floor(e) % 100000 ?
You would add each floor as an overlay to your MKMapView and show whatever floor the user selects, hide the others.
Also, perhaps you could create a temporary index on floor_no in the employees table and remove it after the update.
Start with exploring existing open source floor plan projects out there:

[Floor Plan V4 (hyper-link)]
You can also take a look at this blog post that expose how I used [ThreeCSG (hyper-link)] ([Constructive solid geometry (hyper-link)]) to perform boolean operations in the viewer and isolate walls specific to each floor: [Boolean Operations in the Forge Viewer (hyper-link)].
This cause strong internal forces and so weird collisions with floors.
As ceiling and floor are a type of rounding, I thought integer is the appropriate type to return.
Is this the right way to calculate the value of this composite function (floor of square root) in Haskell?
The expression -3.6.floorToDouble() means -(3.6.floorToDouble()) because the postfix .
I don't see any related to a Data Type Floor in the [Google Fit documentation (hyper-link)], maybe this one is a custom data type.
in particular, it will return the floor of the double answer... (C and C++ always truncate) So, basically 5/3 is exactly what you want.
In the original C++ standard, -5 / 3 could be either -1 (rounding towards zero) or -2 (the floor), but -1 was recommended.
In the latest C++0B draft (which is almost certainly very close to the final standard), it is -1, so finding the floor with negative numbers is more involved.
The idea is to use the normal integer divison, but adjust for negative results to match the behaviour of the double floor(double) function.
Timing measurements show that this function here only creates a small overhead compared with the built-in / operator, but of course the floating point based floor function is significantly faster....
Print before you increment floor (floor = floor + 1).
the ‘floor’ function
If they meant math.floor, they would've styled it like they styled fmod, i.e., as code and with math.
What they do mean there is just the mathematical [floor function (hyper-link)].
Looking up [BINARY_FLOOR_DIVIDE (hyper-link)]:
Looking up [PyNumber_FloorDivide (hyper-link)]
Looking up [nb_floor_divide (hyper-link)]:
Now int and floor both have their own:
Looking up [float_floor_div (hyper-link)]:
And I think floor is from C, so depends on whatever C compiler was used to compile your CPython.
The Math.Floor has to account for a lot of different scenarios of handling different types.
The primary reason Math.floor is slower (where it actually is--in some tests I've done it's faster) is that it involves a function call.
Newer engines can inline the call, or at least make the property lookup faster, but they still need a guard condition in case you (or some other script) overwrote the Math.floor function.
They also give a different result for negative numbers, since converting to integers truncates and Math.floor always rounds down.
For example, Math.floor(-2.1) === -3, but (-2.1) | (-2.1) === -2.
For optimal results, adjust the position parameter to your model and host the icon-floorplan-black.svg and icon-floorplan-blue.svg icons somewhere, that link might not stay up forever
Since floor detection is the main aim, I'd say instead of segmenting by color, you could try separation by texture.
Corresponding floored and modulo constexpr implementations here, along with templates to select the necessary overloads (as full optimization and to prevent mismatched sign comparison warnings):
You probably have 2 Admob publisherIds, one for the eCPM floor and one for non-floor.
It's the same for floor.
Both Math.ceil(dob) and Math.floor(dob) returns double values then those are print as 5.0 and 4.0
I would recommend you to start from an existing proto, for example, WEBOTS_HOME/projects/objects/floors/protos/Floor.proto.
Copy and rename this file to MyFloor.proto for example and edit it to change the coordinates of the IndexedFaceSet node.
That will move the floor origin at a corner of the floor.
Also, the boundingObject should be updated so that the floor looks nicer when selected.
To read full procedure visit [floor documentation (hyper-link)]
I swapped Round for Floor because that works but if I switch Round for
  Floor function I get the error.
Because floor takes 1 argument and you are passing 2 in, the nested case and the numeric 2.
Its old version (without floor/ceiling/top of walls) is here:
Its more complicated than yours as it allows walls with different heights and separate texture for wall, floor and ceiling (however ceiling is not implemented yet I used cloud texture instead) and also jumps (z position of player).
use result of the ray from wall test instead of casting floor/ceiling ray
As you want to have separate tiles on ceiling and floor then you should use ray marching like ray cast.
So you just need to add the perpendicular distance to camera and render the line segment as a perspective correct interpolated textured line for floor and ceiling.
render floor and ceiling without per pixel of row/col raycast
Simple ray casters do use non textured floor/ceiling which makes this simple just render half of screen with sky and the other with ground color before rendering the walls (or after it if rendered walls start and end is remembered):
[image]
something like this in code:
[code snippet]
To make this more nice usually for outdoor parts of map sky texture is added that covers the ceiling.
Just trying the query assign([1,2,3],Floors) at the prompt, you'd discover whether it works as intended or not.
It looks like you can exploit the semantics of to_int as specified in SMT-LIB2 (see [http://smtlib.cs.uiowa.edu/theories/Reals_Ints.smt2 (hyper-link)]) to take the floor using a function (rise4fun link: [http://rise4fun.com/Z3/da5I (hyper-link)]):
You need to Commit your transaction after creating the Floor.
If you're hit testing against existing planes with infinite extent, you should see at least two results in the situation you describe: first the table/desk/etc, then the floor.
If you specifically want the floor, there are a couple of ways to find it:
If you already know which ARPlaneAnchor is the floor from earlier in your session, search the array of hit test results for one whose [anchor (hyper-link)] matches.
Assume the floor is always the plane farthest from the camera (the last in the array).
You cannot use floor_date() for integers; it is for date or datetime objects.
Floor a Year in R to nearest decade:
Ceiling is exactly like floor, but add 10.
You can also use the floor function like this:
If you need to round and not floor:
The logic here is take the floor of a negative result from the integer division if it doesn't divide evenly.
[floorDiv() (hyper-link)] from Java.Math that does exactly what you want.
I would use [floorDiv() (hyper-link)] for a general case, as Frank Harper suggested.
Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) gives quite uniform distribution, while Math.round(Math.random() * 10) doesn't.
Math.floor() returns 0 for any value in the range [0, 1) (1 exclusive), 1 for any value in the range [1, 2), etc.
I really like to trigger 31-bit int instead of Math.floor(), by doing a binary "or 0" operation.
This might seem like premature optimization, but as I said, I like how it looks, and it takes less typing than Math.floor().
To compute a floor value without any extra functions is fairly simple.
Just simply use this line to compute the floor value of the number:
You want to set the floor to be of the type [kinematic (hyper-link)], not [static (hyper-link)].
With the car being dynamic and the floor being static, the floor isn't interacting with other objects in any fashion, and you explicitly want a collision.
I suspect the core of the problem in your local example is that the floor object doesn't actually have an SCNPhysicsBody associated with it.
Until I explicitly set it on SCNFloor (as static), the text blob "fell through" as you originally described.
Using stock SCNFloor to establish geometry for the physics collection made a tiny target (which is why the slight horizontal impulse made it appear to "pass through").
This last update sets the floor geometry to a long, wide, thin box.
According to [a recent episode of Radiolab (about "Falling") (hyper-link)], a cat reaches terminal velocity by the 9th floor.
The riskiest floors are 5th to 9th.
You can easily write a little DP (dynamic programming) for the general case of n floors and m cats.
If first cat is thrown from k-th floor and dies, we now have k - 1 floors to check (all below k) and m - 1 cats (a[k - 1][m - 1]).
If cat survives, there're n - k floors left (all floors above k) and still m cats.
We try every possible floor to find the best result, hence min(f(k)) : for k in 1..n.
The cat can survive a fall out of a low story window, but will die if thrown from a high floor.
I started by working out the maximum floor that could be covered using x cats and y guesses using the following method.
Start with 1 floor and keep increasing the number of guesses while keeping track of floors checked, which guess they were checked on and how many cats were remaining for each floor.
This very inefficient code to compute the given answer but nonetheless useful for small number of cats / floors.
For 2 cats the maximum floors that can be identified in x guesses is:
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28...
After extensive research (mostly involving typing numbers sequences into [OEIS (hyper-link)]) I noticed that the maximum floors for x follows a [combination (hyper-link)] piecewise pattern.
From here I took the easy approach of simple incrementing n until I pass the required number of floors.
Given an n-story building, there must be a floor f such that eggs dropped from floor f break, but eggs dropped from floor f-1 survive.
(If the egg breaks from any floor, we'll say f = 1.
If the egg survives from any floor, we'll say f = n+1).
You seek to find the critical floor f. The only operation you can perform is to drop an egg off some floor and see what happens.
Dropping the egg from each floor starting at the first will find the critical floor in (at-worst) n operations.
At any time in any algorithm, let g the highest floor from which the egg has been seen not to break.
The algorithm must test floor g+1 before any higher floor h > g+1, else if the egg were to break from floor h, it could not distinguish between f=g+1 and f=h.
Start by dropping the first egg in increments of r floors.
When the first egg breaks, say at floor ar, we know the critical floor f must be (a-1)r < f <= ar.
We then drop the second egg from each floor starting at (a-1)r. When the second egg breaks, we have found the critical floor.
Consider the sequence of floors from which it drops the first egg (so long as it doesn't break).
When f is in this interval, the algorithm will have to investigate it with the second egg, and that must be done floor-by-floor recalling the 1-egg case.
Drop each egg with constant intervals, which should be taken as the powers of the kth root of n. For example, for n=1000 and k=3, search intervals of 100 floors with the first egg, 10 with the second egg, and 1 with the last egg.
We deduce the recurrence by optimising where to drop the first egg (floor g), presuming we know optimal solutions for smaller parameters.
If the egg breaks, we have the g-1 floors below to explore with k-1 eggs.
If the egg survives, we have n-g floors above to explore with k eggs.
I found the solution on how to force the floor change for a particular building.
When you are searching and have found the floor the ARKit will put out a grid, normally people use some kind of grid image to display this, but some don't want to show it.
Once the grid has placed you place a SCNPlane, which i assume has an physical body as you say it falls towards the floor / furniture?
You can to stop the worldTrackingConfiguration once the floor has
been found.
You can once the floor has been found, fetch that Y-position and bind every object to fall towards that Y-position.
I guess you could check if the Y-position of the new detection overlaps with the floor detection, then it's fine else it's not.
For 2D Floor plans, it was displaying that view.
Deconstruct the date into its parts, then reconstruct it using the necessary parts, adjusting the part that needs to be floor'd.
To floor an integer value to a multiplier, simply divide by the multiplier and multiply it again.
So, to floor the WhenCreated value to multiple of 2 hours:
create a custom feilds #txt1 for getting floor from user
Writing if(floor < 13); is like writing if (floor > 13) { }.
You are right that in Python 3 you can't compute floor division of complex numbers anymore, but you need to specify how you want it to behave, if you need a workaround.
In any case, you will need to implement a new class that inherits from complex, and override the __floordiv__ method
It has large amount of tools, including floor and mod for complex numbers.
Unless (anything) is a multiple of (2+3j), then your answer will also be complex, hence floor-division is not well-defined.
According to [the documentation (hyper-link)], ROUND_FLOOR rounds towards negative infinity, thus rounding -14.000... to -15.
I guess the one you use doesn't do this and you will end up with a random result from what was on the stack, calling floor probably changed that.
The [WorksheetFunction.Floor Method (hyper-link)] in VBA is a little different from the worksheets =Floor function:
1) Load in the floor plan image with Matlab or NumPy/matplotlib.
2) Use some built-in edge detection to locate the edge pixels in the floor plan.
3) Form a big list of (x,y) locations where an edge is found in the floor plan.
5) Scatterplot the points of the floor plan as an overlay.
This method does have the advantage that you can change the style of the floorplan points easily, making them larger, thicker, thinner, different colors, or transparent, depending on how you want it to interact with the heat map.
Note that it doesn't really make sense to apply floor to an integral type (well, it does, it's just a no-op).
What you should be really worried about is the fact that your code is apparently passing something of type ZZ into floor!
You compare the ball position on Y axis ball.y to the bar width floor.width, it may be a typing/editing mistake.
You should replace floor.width by floor.y to check whether the ball hits the bar when it falls.
But floor is an Array of Rectangle, it includes the bar and potential bricks to break, if I guess it right.
So you need to loop through floor before checking, otherwise floor.height equals undefined.
Then, floor isn't an appropriate name for an Array which doesn't contain any 'floor'.
What I've done before is made one huge box as the floor, say 200x200, then set a sky with a position of -200 so it sits "lower" on the scene and gives the illusion of the ground expanding into infinity.
Casting a float to an int is an implicit floorf i.e.
I think the question that you're really asking is "suppose I do a calculation that produces an inexact result, which mathematically should be exactly 2.0, but is actually slightly less; when I apply floor to that value, I get 1.0 instead of 2.0--how do I prevent this?"
I am adding this as a supplemental answer for those who come here looking how to use floor and ceil with a CGFloat (like I did).
There is no need to use the C floor and ceil functions anymore.
So, if you don't want Math.floor, you should take it out?
Or, if sometimes you want Math.floor, you need to investigate the neg value as this is what is causing your return value to always be rounded down.
Floor plans are available in [select locations (hyper-link)].
If floor plan data is not available for a building that you would like to highlight in your application, you can: 1) Add floor plans to Google Maps directly.
2) Display a floor plan as a Ground Overlay.
This will enable only users of your application to view your floor plans.
I suspect that numpy uses the divmod function to compute the floor division and the line causing this is [here (hyper-link)]:
Each building has a default floor which will be selected when the picker is first displayed.
well, you would need to have all the levels in the building and the current selected floor.
I didn't find a direct method to convert floor plans into hierarchical graphs, instead I used a  [graph editor (hyper-link)] to draw a graph that represent the floor plan and then used the resulting  file ( which is similar to XML format) and parsed in.
[Math.Floor (hyper-link)] will return a double or decimal; you're trying to assign it to an int variable
Your divisions are being performed in integer arithmetic, which is presumably not what you were intending given that you're using Math.Floor.
It's not clear whether you actually want Floor or Ceiling though - I would have expected Ceiling to be more appropriate in this case.
[Math.Floor (hyper-link)] accepts and returns either a double or a decimal, so you'd have to cast the result to an int in order to asign the result to an int variable.
However, because you're dealing with integers already, you can just skip calling Math.Floor and take advantage of integer arithmetic:
When doing a floor, although it would be possible to convert the argument to an integer, this is not what most languages would do because the original type is a floating-point number.
My guess is that the main confusion here is around the functionality of floor.
Floor takes as input a vector and outputs a vector that applies the floor function (round down to nearest integer) to each element of the vector, so floor(c(1,2,3)) will return c(1,2,3) and floor(1.3) will return 1.
You could do something like floor( val / step ) * step
Try to find an object-oriented way to describe your floorplan by ignoring how the plan will be painted.
You could do that by -for instance- creating a Floor-Object and a Room-Object.
A Floor-Object would contain Room-Objects.
Each Room-Object would know where it is on the Floor and how it is formed or what size it has.
Once you have those two object, it's pretty much straightforward to 'serialize' them to a DB, with a sql table having a list of boards, and another table having a list of 'floor parts' linked to their own board through an identifier.
Instead of using floor to "truncate" the time part, use the date-only date type :
On zooming to the building which is having floors information on google, floorpicker is automatically showed and then we can toggle it.
With some newer Android phones (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S3), embedded barometric pressure sensors can be used to derive an accurate indoor altitude estimate, which could be transformed into floors (assuming you know which elevation the floor is located at).
I was just working on a similar question, and realized that adding an SCNFloor did not necesarily create a good geometry to interact with as the PhysicsBody.
In my case, I made the floor geometry a very wide, long, and thin box shape rather than trying to use the built-in "floor" geometry, which created only a tiny cube for collision interactions.
It would seem that x[0] is ever so slightly less than 15 and so floor takes the value down to 14.
Creating a fuzzy floor function based on this:
Edit:
The above solution does not handle the dates which are already floored to the beginning of the month.
there is a [pandas issue (hyper-link)] about the floor problem
To ceiling or floor a variable it is as simple as using the PHP builtin math functions:
floor takes a float and returns a float rounded down to the nearest integer.
[http://php.net/manual/en/function.floor.php (hyper-link)]
you'r floor looks a lot like a grid layout!!
You need an abs somewhere because the sign of the slope changes, so floor cannot do it that its own.
About the surprising warning of the compiler, it is simply due to the fact that the function FLOOR is generic : the compiler needs to know the type of the argument to select the right FLOOR variant function.
As the argument was incorrect, the compiler has deduced that FLOOR was an identifier of your program (yes !
Floors should not be rotated.
It is possible that you have misunderstood what "floor" and "ceil" were supposed to be.
It is possible that what you are looking for is the largest value less than k in the tree, for floor, and the smallest value more than k in the tree, for ceil.
You can assume that you would start by placing a tile aligned with a corner of the floor (with two possible orientations), and once this tile is placed it creates two sub-problems of smaller rectangles.
One thing to note is that an expression like floor(x + 0.5), while not having the exact same semantics that round(x) does, is a valid substitute in almost all use cases, and I doubt it is anywhere near 10x slower than floor(x).
when you use floor() it will (correctly) round it down to 6
A workaround is to floor(round($value, 15));.
Rounding without flooring might be more correct, the results are different depending on precision.
floor, however returns 2.
floor --> floor(0.2)==0 && floor(0.8)==0
So one way to get the floor level you need to set an access point (AP) at the entering position of each floor, that is at the opening of elevator or stairs.
So based on the signals from the AP you can distinguish the floor.
So with these data you can identify the floor, even if there exist another AP signal from nearer floor.
You could try [Archilogic (hyper-link)] - if you already have a 2D floor plan it usually takes less than 24 hours to get a 3D model back.
If you don't have a floor plan, you could use the web editor to create the 3D model yourself, too.
If floor information is not available for the current location, the value of this property is nil.

you can create a new floor_division and module_ fields in your Model_Item, then you use the post save receiver to update the floor_division and module_ fields
Neither class F nor it's parent Combinable implement __floordiv__, so // is not implemented.
but the flooring division first rounds downwards, and then floors down to the integer.
More specifically, [float.__floordiv__ (hyper-link)] in CPython calls [float_divmod (hyper-link)] which in turn uses the [fmod C standard library function (hyper-link)] to find the floating point remainder of the division.
substitue in std::floor or std::round for a myFloor or myRound as desired.
One simple way of doing this is (as given by @SirGuy above) where we use ceiling or floor as a test - this is good, because it allows us to choose the significant number of digits we are interested in.
floor() rounds down.
Putting it differently, the floor() is always going to be lower or equal to the original.
The floor of a float value is the next lowest integer.
To add to Hyperboreus' answer, this is strictly speaking not an ABAP question, as the ceiling and floor functions are generic mathematical functions included in other languages too.
FLOOR has the meaning of rounding the number down - to floowr...
floor -> 4.0
  ceil  -> 5.0
floor is return Largest integer value.
FLOOR returns the nearest Smallest integer 
CEIL returns the nearest Largest Interger
Since round(), floor() and ceil() only accomplished a portion of the required functionality, I wrote a small function to accomplish the proper rounding.
Ceiling, Floor, and Round functions are then
Floor function returns the greatest integer not greater than x.
// in Python is a "floor division" operator.
That means that the result of such division is the floor of the result of regular division (performed with / operator).
The floor of the given number is the biggest integer smaller than the this number.
7 / 2 = 3.5 so 7 // 2 = floor of 3.5 = 3.
For negative numbers it is less intuitive: -7 / 2 = -3.5, so -7 // 2 = floor of -3.5 = -4.
Similarly -1 // 10 = floor of -0.1 = -1.
// is defined to do the same thing as math.floor(): return the largest integer value less than or equal to the floating-point result.
Why would floor(x) change a certain bit of x when x is a round number (29)?
Because double you are using has no precision to store the result of calculations exact, so it rounds, and because the result of calculation is away from a whole number floor rounds to the whole number.
Floor then truncates the 1 and gives exact 29.
With Solidworks tutorials : FloorShadows Property (ISwScene)
so floor(a/b) will also be 9.0.
Then a/b could be down-approximated with more than 1/2 unit in the last place and so be less than n. Hence the exact value of a/b = n whereas floor(a/b) = n-1.
The following C++ code returns 126 exceptions of floor((i/1000)/0.001) that are different from i.
If there is no FLOOR function on that built-in server, try this:
If you are planning to use Google Places API you can try using floor information provided after geocoding the location.
Because of rounding errors, you will occasionally get a result that is ever so slightly less than 4, and so std::floor will round down to 3.
Knowing about this error, you can increase the std::pow() result before calling std::floor.
The return value of floor() is still of type float because the value range of float is usually bigger than that of integer.

Simpler post-processing approach: since you have a flat floor, render the mountains vertically flipped on a framebuffer object, blur it, and render the regular scene on top.
if you are in floor 1 and you go near that sensor it increments to floor 2 , if you are in floor 2 it decrements to floor 1 , and so on for all the stairs and elevators.
The only workaround I'm aware of is to manually add your own floor picker, then add each floor as an ImageMapType and switch between them.
Unfortunately, this requires you to provide all of the floor imagery yourself rather than use Google's.
If you don't have the content as objects you can combine rendering a floor as an object (flat rectangle which you can produce inside three.js), and insert the remaining graphics as sprites on top (with obvious limitations that the room is in a fixed view, i.e.
The main idea and the main issue is how to calculate next floor (targetFloor).
I suggest to create a list of inputs  List<int> inputs, flag that shows is elevator go down or up bool IsGoingUp and two int variables - currentFloor and targetFloor and recalculate target floor every time when user clicks a button, based on direction and on inputs.
Method DrawAnimation () draws everything based on currentFloor and targetFloor.
It also should recalculate target floor to handle when elevator reachs another target floor.
This expression will always match all 4 number groups (1/2/3/4) so you will need to do some additional processing to determin if an address has a housenumber and stairs and floor and door, compared to if an address only has a housenumber and door.
As an alternative, you can get the group numbers / names in the order of the specified schedule in the question, by capturing the digits of the stairs / floor / door and asserting how many parts of a forward slash followed by a digit are directly to the right.
: Non capture group

/(?<floor>\d+) Group floor, match 1+ digits

"floor" is indeed a Math function.
Also attach collider to the walls and floors.
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions (hyper-link)]
fabs(floor(a) - floor(b)) < 0.0001 only if floor(a) == floor(b), as long as you're in the range of integers that doubles can accurately represent: [Does casting to an int after std::floor guarantee the right result?
floor (x) and ceil (x) are always integer values.
Any difference between two numbers floor or ceil (x) and floor or ceil (y) is the difference between two integer values, and therefore an integer.
ceil — Round fractions up
floor — Round fractions down
ceil (4.1) = 5
      floor (4.1) = 4
ceil() function used to get the next highest integer value by rounding fractions up whereas floor() function converts a specified numeric value to the next lowest integer value by rounding.
So when you are using ceil(), the value you get and if it contains decimal points it will always be rounded to the next highest integer but floor will round it to the next lowest integer.
More info on ceil and floor can be found here : [http://php.net/manual/en/function.ceil.php (hyper-link)] and [http://php.net/manual/en/function.floor.php (hyper-link)]
But I think just use floor to get the correct output :
If Object is falling through the floor, here are the things to check.
If Rigidbody is attached to the GameObject then make sure that the player is 100% above the floor before clicking "Play" or you will experience even more problems.
This will let the player not go through the floor but go through any other Objects you want.
You can then use thee OnTriggerEnter function to detect when there is a collision between those objects that's not a floor.
To archive this i have face one [Query (hyper-link)] and finally resolved this and implement the Floor Map Like my 1st question link.
If you want your character to stay on top the floor you should disable IsTriggered option in your colliders.
There is no need to add a RigidBody2D to your floor object.
I haven't worked with depth cameras yet, but I have with normal cameras which return a 2d frame, one way you can solve this is that in the first few frames you are detecting the floor perfectly right ?
This way you don't have to calculate/estimate the floor again and again.
In this case you know that the floor of the continued logarithm is N. This is similar to what Bill Gosper does at the start of the linked document.
To illustrate this, suppose that these coroutines don't spit out run-length encoded values, but decimal digits, and we want to calculate floor(sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)).
(A simpler example would be to take the floor of a routine that produces 0.9999...)
It is not possible to take the floor of this expression, as -- by the numerical methods employed -- it is not possible to decide if the real value will end up below or above N.
The computational code for the requested floor_div() using div() is neat and tidy.
Floored division can be performed by using a division and modulo.
The remainder of a "floor division", is either 0, or has the same sign as the divisor.
Let's compare "floor division" and "truncate division", focus on the range of remainder:
let q, r = quotient and remainder of "floor division";
However we can get r quite easily: r = r0+b, and r is guaranteed to be in [1, b-1], which is inside the "floor" range.
As an ending, an implementation of "floor division" in C++11:
If it doesn't, a possible workaround is to detect if the compiler is C++ and cast the "value" of floor to the signature of the desired overload if so, for example:
This makes floor division consistent with the other arithmetic operations.
printf("%.15f\t%.15f\t%.15f\n", a, a + 0.5, floor(a + 0.5));
You can easily just use a single static (stationary) Box if you want a flat plane as the floor.
The method I ended up going with (you can see from my other questions) is to dynamically create the floor at runtime and then draw it to the screen.
I am attempting to do the same thing for a University and that is the only way I knew of where you could know that you are on a second or third floor.
(building name) (Floor number) (Floor elevation).
Then when you give the building lat/long you also give the elevation variable and then it associates it with a floor number.
rotation axis
will be parallel to your floor and perpendicular to your movement.
Let:
n - floor normal vector
t - movement direction parallel with floor (tangent)
b - our rotation axis (binormal)
so we can compute it as:
[code snippet]
Either use [Rodrigues_rotation_formula (hyper-link)] and encode it as transform matrix or simply construct your own rotation matrix that will represent your sphere aligned to floor.
So if center point of your mesh is (0,0,0) then place your sphere r above the floor...
Now just each elapsed time dt [sec] (like timer) multiply this matrix by incremental [rotation matrix (hyper-link)] around y axis (as b is our rotation axis) and angle omg*dt [rad].
So first compute the rotations and then compute the direction of translation from the grip forces with floor and inertia.
Finds the floor and remainder using integer division and modulus operators, then corrects for negative fractions.
This shows that the remainder is relatively difficult to correct without using the floor.
Finds the floor the same way as Implementation 2, then uses the floor to find the remainder like Implementation 1.
Compared results and yes you do have to transform the pointcloud point to floor plane coordinates before comparing distance...only thing I can think of is that sometimes ArCore thinks the floor plan is not parallel to world coordinates so it's actually at an angle so some of the distance comparisons are off...
Re-reading the previous question that you pointed to, [Autodesk Viewer: Suggestions for 2D view of floor view (hyper-link)], and its comments more carefully, I have the impression that the Collaboration for Revit tool or C4R add-in mentioned there allows you select addition views to include in the translation, both 2D and 3D:
That said, you shouldn't need to worry about flooring a value since browsers can handle the floating point numbers just fine.
Number of floors should not be hard-coded, you should retrieve the number of floors using the COUNT function.
floored as you your question goes), the one way to do it would be:
my_floor <- function(x) {
  x <- trunc(x)
  return (x)
 }
my_floor <- function(x) {
   x <- x-0.5
   x <- as.integer(x) #Store the result of this second step by reassigning x
   return (x)
 }
[Flood-fill (hyper-link)] the floors from some starting floor.
If you find any floor that hasn't been filled in the above step, we know it's not connected to the rest.
The theory first: when pricing the coupon with a floor, you can't just take the expected LIBOR rate from your forecast curve and take the minimum between that and the floor.
Instead, you need to take the expected value of the minimum between the rate and the floor, and unfortunately E[min(R,F)] is not the same as min(E[R],F).
So no, the floor doesn't just provide a minimum; you need a different formula to estimate the expected payoff.
The implication for QuantLib is that simple floating-rate coupons can be (and are) set a default pricer that just reads the rate off the forecast curve, but coupons with caps or floors need the user to specify what pricer to use and to provide it with any additional needed data; in your case, this means at least a volatility term structure, although more optional data can be specified; see the constructor of the BlackIborCouponPricer class for details.
Usually, the volatility is bootstrapped on market quotes for caps and floors, but the procedure to create it is kind of complex (see [these tests (hyper-link)] for an example in C++), I'm not sure that all the needed classes are exported to Python, and you'll be better off asking about it on the [QuantLib mailing list (hyper-link)].
Obviously also call buttons on every floor, etc.
Representations of the arrows or indicators on each floor (almost a "view" of the elevator model).
Representation of the building (in some cases, as certain floors may be blocked at times, etc.)
It has a direction (up, down, stand, maintenance), a current floor and a list of floor requests sorted in the direction.
It contains the elevators and receives the requests from the floors.
if available pick a standing elevator for this floor.
else pick an elevator moving to this floor.
else pick a standing elevator on an other floor.
Stand: the elevator is fixed on a floor.
And the elevator is on that floor, the doors open.
If it is on another floor, it moves in that direction.
Each time it reaches a floor, it checks if it needs to stop.
Then it removes the floor from the request list and checks if there is another request.
And if it is on a floor, the doors open, the request list is cleared, the requests moved back to the bank.
Opens the doors if an elevator is on a floor and not moving.
EDIT:
Some elevators don't start at bottom/first_floor esp.
min_floor & max_floor are two additional attributes for Elevator.
The building will contain a fixed number of floors.
The passengers will be counted as they leave the elevator at their destination floor.
The destination floor will be determined using a "random" Poisson interval.
When all of the passengers in the elevator have reached their destination floors, the elevator will return to the lobby to pickup more passengers
A Controller class will assign which floor to go in the queue.
When the queue is empty, the run() method will wait (queue.wait() ), when a floor is assigned to this elevator, it will call queue.notify() to wake up the run() method, and run() method will call goToFloor(queue.pop()).
At the time this question was asked, Google Maps for web didn't support the floor buttons (to the best of my knowledge), so we moved to using the native SDK's on Android and iOS instead.
Here's the thing: floor(0.5 + input) does not always recover the same result as the corresponding std::round call!
Before that, only [std::floor (hyper-link)] was available so programmers were using it.
With floor(), you can be consistent with the results.
Not all languages have a round() function, and in those languages it's normal to use floor(x + 0.5) as a substitute.
I see lots of "old" C/C++ programs using floor(0.5 +
  input) instead of round(input).
When sampling, however, rounding up using static_cast<int>(floor(f + .5)) yields less sampling noise, this increments the dynamic range.
Consider: If floor() returned an integer, what should floor(1.0e30) return?
The whole point of ceil/floor operations is to convert floats to integers!
The point of the ceil and floor operations is to round floating-point data to integral values.
Additionally, you must have versions of ceil and floor which return floating-point numbers if you want to conform to [IEEE 754 (hyper-link)].
The python functions are wrappers of the C function and so this is really a deficiency of the C functions where they should have returned an integer and forced the programer to do the range/NaN/Inf check before calling ceil/floor.
Like this curious behavior of math.floor().
The floor() function in the context of numerical calculations has ALWAYS returned a float.
So we expect without a second thought, that math.floor() is the same function as the C standard library floor() which takes a float argument and returns a float value.
The use of floor() as a numerical math concept goes back to 1798 per the Wikipedia page on the subject: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions#Notation (hyper-link)]
The floor() function in this context has always been a floating-point numerical calculation as all(most) the functions in the math library.
Floor() has always CORRECTLY preserved values like Nan and +inf and -inf in numerical calculations.
If Floor returns an int, it totally breaks the entire concept of what the numerical floor() function was meant to do.
math.floor(float("nan")) must return "nan" if it is to be a true floating-point numerical floor() function.
Keeping in mind however that floor() rounds towards negative infinity and int() rounds towards zero so they give different answers for negative numbers.
And in this same light, it's logical to make // be a floor(a/b) function, and not an "int divide".
And as long as the rest of the language is doing a good job of casting ints to floats when needed, such as in divide, or math.sqrt(), it's logical to have math.floor() return an int, because if it is needed as a float later, it will be converted correctly back to a float.
math.floor(a/b) and a//b should act the same way, but the fact that they don't I guess is just a matter of history not yet adjusted for consistency.
And we can see in this case, the OP, who didn't understand the history of the numerical floor() function, needed and expected it to return an int from their thinking about mathematical integers and reals.
A great book that will make you extremely proficient at working with floors and ceilings, as well as several other useful things besides, is [Concrete Mathematics: A Foundation for Computer Science (hyper-link)] by Graham, Knuth and Patashnik.
"For all x, for all y, floor(x) * ceil(y) <= floor(xy)" — Just take x=1, and y not integer: then it's saying that ceil(y) ≤ floor(y), which is obviously not true.
"Some X, Some Y, floor(x) * ceil(y) >= floor(xy)" — Again, take x=1, and any y: then it's saying that ceil(y) ≥ floor(y), which is true.
"For all X, for all Y, floor(x) * ceil(y) > ceil(xy)" — Take x=1 again!
In VR, the origin is generally the floor.
Building off @Vincent Zoonekynd's excellent answer, If the aim was to use floor on the data, you can just strip the "V" and call floor on the rest:
?floor says
‘floor’ takes a single numeric argument ‘x’ and returns a numeric vector containing the largest integers not greater than the corresponding elements of ‘x’.
The [MATLAB help online (hyper-link)] describes floor as "round toward negative infinity", and the actual help text is
Y = floor(X) rounds each element of X to the nearest integer less than or equal to that element.
I looked at the properties of a Revit floor in an RVT BIM imported into a NavisWorks NWD file.
Among many others, the floor contains the following Revit Element properties:
The floors are authored in Revit
If you want to prevent this, use both floor and ceil, and compare the values.
If you want to convert the answer to integer, just use round instead of floor.
IMHO using GeoDjango for a floor plan isn't a bad idea.
A simpler solution would be using [OpenLayers (hyper-link)] directly with an image of the a (maybe scanned) floor plan as background layer.
An example of using OpenLayers for a floor plan is [Office Plans via Open Layers (hyper-link)].
How often will the floor plan change?
Your floor was a text.
Starting iOS 10 and macOS 10.12 the SCNFloor class has [width (hyper-link)] and [length (hyper-link)] properties that allow for non-infinite floors.
This can lead to confusing results: for
example, floor((0.1+0.7)*10) will usually return 7 instead of the
expected 8, since the internal representation will be something like
7.9999999999999991118....
Since you're almost never going to get a perfect balance in your errors, the ball is either going to speed up or slow down, eventually escaping or sitting on the floor.
First, clean tables from POS screen and after that you can create the tables and floors from the Odoo itself in the Floor Planning section add the floor and tables belongs to that floor,
FYI, Python 2.x returns a float from math.floor.
If you are looking for the floor of integer division, you can use //.
Also there are some similar (but not same) problems discussed on StackOverflow:
[Algorithm to 'count the number of ways a floor of size 5*N can be filled with tiles of sizes 1*5 and 2*5' (hyper-link)]
and
[Tiling different size rectangles (hyper-link)]
I doubt such an algorithm is possible, since floor(√2 n) has at least as many digits as n, so it will take time O(log n) just to output the answer.
2.3 will still floor to 2.29.
This is not a result of the flooring, but instead the result of writing 2.3 as double.
Thus in such a sane language, floor(round(x)) and round(x) are always the same.
Can floor-ing a rounded number gives a different answer than the rounded number?
When dealing with ieee-754 numbers, floor(round(x)) != round(x) is true or ("not necessarily equal" per OP's quesiton) when x is Not-A-Number.
Otherwise the result of a round() is always an integer value or infinity and `floor-ing does not change the value.
contactProperties: You probably need to add a contact property defining the properties of the contact between the floor and your robot's wheels (to increase the friction, and decrease the spongyness of the contact).
The Python interpreter is pre-calculating the expression inside the loop in floor, but not in normal.
Here's the code for floor:
Adding from __future__ import division at the top of the program causes the constant to be folded in normal just as it was in floor (although the result is different of course, since now / is float division).
[Why Python's Integer Division Floors (hyper-link)]
It might be that python classic division (referred by you as normal) is implemented by hardware floating point division and truncated back into integer only in the final stage, while true division (referred by you as floored) is implemented using hardware int division which is a lot faster.
In truth, though, if you're about to apply the Master Theorem to a recurrence like this one, then the precise statement involving floor and ceiling hardly matters.
[math.floor (hyper-link)] requires a float value.
[math.floor() (hyper-link)] only accepts a single float value argument (or an object with a __floor__() method).
Here's what's going on: when the object is low enough to go through the floor, you invert and divide by 2 gravityStrength.
Your robot origin is at it's center, so you have to translate your floor or the robot half the robot's height.
When the representation of 616.81 is multiplied by 100, the result is a tiny bit less than 61681, and thus calling floor on it will return 61680.
You can add on the second floor a repeater to the first floor router, and connect the repeater to the router via an Ethernet cable, this way you will no longer have security issues on the second floor!
floor<days> simply truncates the precision to tp to days precision (making it a count of days since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).
Both ymd and floor<days>(tp) contain exactly the same information.
std::chrono::sys_days is simply a type alias for the type of the expression floor<days>(tp), which has type:
Instead, even when selecting data on the persisted field TestFloorDate, SQLServer (or at least my version) prefers an index on TestDate.
I fixed the problem by using a primitive shape (btBoxShape) for the floor instead of using meshes for everything.
In this case, ceiling or flooring the middle value doesn't matter.
However, if we use left = middle+1 and right = middle, we must take the floor of the middle value, otherwise we end up in an endless loop.
both ceiling and flooring work fine with left = middle+1 and right = middle-1
flooring works fine with left = middle+1 and right = middle
The floor division gives round off value.
When can I expect the floor function to work incorrectly and when it works correctly for sure?
When can I expect the floor function to work incorrectly and when it works correctly for sure?
If you know that your number is very close to an integer, but might be off a little bit due to representation error, you can add 0.5 before flooring.
If you don't know that the result should be an integer, then you simply have to accept the fact that floor and ceil operations increase the maximum error of your calculation to 1.0.
When can I expect the floor function to work incorrectly and when it works correctly for sure?
floor() is exact for all positive arguments.
The behavior that surprises you does not originate with floor and has nothing to do with floor.
floor() is the only place in your code that does not involve approximation.
The next integer, 13, is 0x1.ap+3, but the computation does not quite reach that value, and so the behavior of floor() is to round down to 12.
The rule is to perform floor(), ceil() or fmod() last in a series of calculations.
If you cast an int to a float, as in your code,  then floor() is not going to behave has you expect.
and hence floor gives you 29 in the output.
This is because floor(-6.3) is 7 .Hence it will become 29.
Now you applied floor on it which give you result '29'
FLOOR() returns the largest integer value not greater than a number specified as an argument.
floor (col_a - col_b - col_c)
Returns output floor(29.99999904632569) which give you answer - > 29
How do you  want this floor to look, will you be looking at it from above, or from an angle?
I can just use the below to gather the floor and ceil values
The reason why you are getting 114 instead of 115 is that floor rounds down, towards the nearest integer, thus floor(114.999999999) becomes 114.
Of course, when floor comes along, it doesn't know any better and lops it all the way down.
it's floor();
Otherwise you could multiply by 100 (if you want 2 dps), use floor(), then divide by 100 to get the result.
TL, DR: unless your location is on the [indoor mapping list (hyper-link)], floor will be nil.
Some buildings have taller floors than others.
Define directions for your floor plan.
Floor plan is basically grid in which first number is row and second number is column.
TL;DR - if you can search google for "residential floor plan" or something, you can create a dataset.
The hard part will be choosing what non-floor plans to include in your data set.
Probably you'll need a lot of random things, but also many things that look close to a residential floor plan, but aren't, so it can get good at distinguishing between a floor plan and a maze, and a pinball layout, and a spreadsheet, etc.
you can first reach 20th floor, then go all the way up => stairs(20)
you can also reach 19th floor, then go to 21st floor, from 21st floor, you have stairs(n-21) ways to floor n, so => stairs(19)*stairs(n-21)
If n > 20, then stairs(n) will be equal to stairs(20) + <number_of_ways_to_climb_to_n_without_reaching_floor20).
How do you avoid floor 20 ?
By reaching floor 19 and going straight to floor 21.
Then, at floor 21, you must climb until you get to floor n.
There are thus stairs(19)*stairs(n-21) to reach floor n without stopping at floor 20.
So it will be constantly colliding with the floor.
you are printing the ry value of solvent[i] but the floor of the ry value of solvent[j].
If the lifts are a possible shortest path from one floor to the next, then they must be edges with weights.
Taking a lift between floors is like walking, say, 50 meters.
However, while stairs can only go from floor X to floor X+1, a lift can go from any floor to any floor, with slightly different times - I usually find the stairs quicker for two floors, but slower for more than 2.
To mirror this you'll need an edge from every floor to every other floor, complete with weightings for each.
If you had a vertex at each floor of the liftshaft, then you'd only need a single path of edges connecting all the floors together, rather than a combinatorial number of edges.
If you also added an additional vertex outside the doors at each level, then you could add the average delay for getting into a lift and so reflect the fact that a lift can pass multiple floors quickly.
At busy times, they can end up stopping at almost every floor anyway, so for a busy campus you wouldn't really gain from these extra vertices.
My vote is for a vertex for each floor of the lift and a single edge to link adjacent floors.
You can just do upside-down floor division:
This works because [Python's division operator does floor division (hyper-link)] (unlike in C, where integer division truncates the fractional part).
Reminiscent of the [Penn & Teller levitation trick (hyper-link)], this "turns the world upside down (with negation), uses plain floor division (where the ceiling and floor have been swapped), and then turns the world right-side up (with negation again)"
Translate the numerator upwards so that floor division rounds down to the intended ceiling.
It may suffice to add a small "delta" to the value you pass to floor.
The range of double is way greater than the range of 32 or 64 bit integers, which is why std::floor returns a double.
And std::floor returns a double because that's the most general.
That'd be hard to do if std::floor returned an int.
If floor only performs the rounding itself, without changing the type, you can cast that to int if/when you need to.
std::floorf() is the single precision version of std::floor() if you'd prefer not to use doubles.
I had stated that the floor was redundant when casting to int, but I forgot that this is only true for positive floating point numbers.
gives 0, and so floor(asd) returns 3.
This is the NumPy ufunc [np.floor_divide (hyper-link)]:
A well-built BIM would probably normally define a separate level for each floor and place each room element on the corresponding level, making it easy to achieve what you need using a suitable [filtered element collector (hyper-link)].
floor is for double (which is same as CGFloat) and floorf is for float (meaning it takes float arguments).
Since you use CGFloat stick with floor.
(Note if you are on watch CGFloat is float so there you'd want to use floorf but FWIW on many architectures floor and floorf are one and the same).
Not sure if this is what is troubling you, but floor rounds down to nearest int.
If you are going to insert 4 rows here you use floor since
If it is a minimum likewise you'd use floor.
The reason you are detecting the floor, is that cv2.threshold marks (with 255 value), the pixels above thresh.
In my project I've done just that but for smaller floorplans than your example floorplan above.
The image below visualizes the current result of my project detection on your example floorplan:
Link to code for creating image : [Floorplan to Blender3d (hyper-link)]
This project is a work in progress.
floor
The floor-function provides the lower-bound of an integral division.
(Basically speaking, the floor-function cuts off all decimals).
Note: If you would like to get the result directly as an int value you might want to use [Mathf.FloorToInt (hyper-link)] instead.
Just for completeness: Excel's [FLOOR (hyper-link)] has a second parameter significance
Additionally, floating-point values can hold NaN, +Inf, and -Inf, all of which are preserved by a floor() operation.
In order to add an image on the floor you should create a PlaneGeometry, a MeshBasicMaterial and then apply them to a Mesh and then change position and rotationOnAxis.
Fill the entire floor with 1x2 tiles.
Considering a 5*5 floor and 8 1*3 tiles.
The only way to put all of the tiles into the floor is:
Put 1*3 tiles first and put 1*3 in such a way that we can put the 1*2 as many as possible(Actually, assume there is n uncovered tiles of the floor, in such a way we can put floor(n/2) 1*2 tiles).
For example, all tiles is 1*3, floor is 1*10, and floor is 2*10 etc.
Or still using floor, you could just divide and multiple by 10
Then multiples the number by 10 to give you the number you imputed with a floor at the tens place
The function "ToInt" takes the floor.
So to implement flooring, you can get the xyzxyzxyz and shift left by abc+1 times.
To do a floor, you'd also need to look at the sign, and rounds negative numbers 'up' towards negative infinity.
The floor of a floating point number is the biggest integer less than or equal to it.
I believe it can do floor plans out of the box.
I assume the implementation of floor is more elegant.
If you want the ceil, floor and what is the closest:
Since d is always positive, you can use that casting to an integer truncates (ie it's the floor for positive input and the ceiling for negative input).
floor(d + 1) is the same as ceil(d) + 1 if integer, ceil(d) otherwise and ceil(d - 1) is the same as floor(d) - 1 if integer, floor(d) otherwise
You need the floor plan image or layout image for each of the floors.
You need to have a couple of Boolean variables to check if the hero is on the floor, and also when the gravity is applied.
So if  he reached the floor or a specific area, you must set the gravity to false, not updating it each frame like you're doing here :  Hero.y_speed += gravity;
If you're pressing the space bar, you need to let the character to jump, then you apply the gravity, by setting the Boolean to true, after that, when it hits the floor, you should disable the gravity, and enable jumping again.
As for your edit: in general, ceil() and floor() might well be implemented in hardware; for example, on x86, GCC (with optimisations enabled) generates code using the frndint instruction with appropriate fiddling of the FPU control word to set the rounding mode.
But fdlibm's pure software implementations ([s_ceil.c (hyper-link)], [s_floor.c (hyper-link)]) do work using the bit representation directly.
lower covers more cases/scenarios than floor so it's a better all-rounder.
For example, floor does not work on enumerations
So you can't use floor on historical/on-disk symbols.
However if you know that you'd only be using it on in-memory data then yes, floor would be quicker as it doesn't require all the checks that are required by lower
Number of floors F that can be explored with M marbles and D drops is
Similarly, ceil, floor, round, can all be achieved with [Double.rounded(FloatingPointRoundingRule) -> Double (hyper-link)].
Instead of floor(), round() and the rest of the rounding routines you can use rounded(_:):
It really depends on if you need to input your own floor plan, or if you can use a map.
And how complex this floor plan is.
So, for positive numbers, the result of casting a floating-point value to an integral type is equivalent to calling floor, but for negative number is is equivalent to calling ceil.
Also, floor returns a double, so i + floor(...) will be performed as a floating point operation instead of an integer operation.
