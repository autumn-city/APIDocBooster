Hi my name's Lucy and today I'm going to 
talk to you about data transformation.  
So why do we sometimes need to transform our 
data? Well, primarily data transformation is  
done to help correct non-normal data and if you're 
wondering what non-normal means I'll explain in  
the next slide. It also allows your data to meet 
the assumptions of a number of parametric tests  
like linear regression and lastly data 
transformation can make patterns in your  
data more interpretable and for this reason it is 
often done even when your data does largely have  
a normal distribution. So this is what we mean 
when we say your data has a normal distribution  
the mean, mode, and median of the data is centred 
and the distribution of your data is uniform so it  
is nicely balanced either side of the centre. The 
fastest way to know whether your data is normally  
distributed is to visualize your data first using 
a histogram. As you can see from the top picture  
this data follows a normal distribution with 
uniform variance and a centred mean, median  
and mode however the bottom two examples do not 
have normally distributed data and this is what  
we called skewed data. In the bottom two examples 
where we have left hand and right hand skewedness  
you could not use a parametric test like linear 
regression without transformation, as the data  
does not meet the assumptions of being normally 
distributed with uniform variance. There are three  
main types of transformations that are used to 
normalize data: the logarithm, the square root  
and the reciprocal. We call these transformations 
variance stabilizing as their main purpose is to  
make the variances either side of the centre the 
same- helping our data to meet the assumptions  
of parametric tests. I'm not going to go into 
the mathematics of each type of transformation  
but let's look at the advantages of each method 
and what data type is most suitable for each one.  
The logarithmic transformation is the most 
commonly used type of data transformation,  
it usually works best for highly right skewed 
data but can be used for both left and right  
hand skewness. It cannot be applied to 
zero or negative values and this is most  
appropriate for continuous variables such 
as height or distance. So here is the  
distribution of a data set before and after 
performing the logarithmic transformation.  
As you can see on the left this data is very 
highly skewed however following transformation  
its mean median and mode are centred and 
its variance is uniformly distributed.  
The square root is a transformation method 
with a moderate effect on distribution shape,  
so it is weaker than the other methods. It is also 
typically used for reducing right hand skewedness  
and has the advantage that it 
can be applied to zero values.  
It is most commonly applied to count data 
especially if the values are mostly small.  
The reciprocal is a very strong transformation 
method which can have a dramatic effect on  
distribution shape. It shouldn't be used on zero 
values and whilst it can be applied to negative  
values it is generally the most useful when all 
the all the values are positive. The advantage  
of using the reciprocal is that it can often be 
easily interpreted in terms of your original data.  
So exactly how do you transform your data? So data 
transformation can very easily be done in software  
like R and SPSS, you can also do it in excel and 
if you wanted to you can even do it by hand using  
a calculator. However I wouldn't recommend this 
as it is very time consuming and you can very  
easily do it in a software that has a built-in 
function especially for data transformation.  
So I hope you found this helpful and good luck
