A dialog**, for example, may not cover the entire previous Activity, and this would be a time for onPause() to be called. 
In most Activities, you will find that you will need to put code in onResume() and onPause(). 
 And let's see what happens when config changes, how it affects the activity.  So, on configuration change, the Android first shuts down the activity by calling method in sequence, that is onPause, then onStop and then onDestroy. 
Activity A's state changes to paused state (which calls onPause on Activity A) 
Then Activity A's state changes from paused to stopped state (which calls  onStop on Activity A) .  onStop is called because Activity B was full screen  non transparent activity. (If Activity B is non-full-sized or transparent then onStop is NOT called on Activity A)
