Instead of writing a wrapper function for it (and taking a performance hit), you can multiply by these constants:
Also, note that if you're trying to find the degrees of rotation for xy coordinates, you should use Math.atan2 so that JavaScript can tell which quadrant the point is in and give you the correct angle:
sin and cos are [builtin Perl functions (hyper-link)], but tan is not.
or import a module that defines the tangent function
In addition to confusing radians and degrees, I think you may be confusing [tangent (hyper-link)] and [arctangent (hyper-link)].
In a comment, you say you call Tan like this: Math.Tan((A(2) - B(2)) / (B(1) - A(1))).
That is a very atypical way to be supplying an angle argument to a tangent!
But tangent won't give you an angle or "radians"!
Based on this, I believe that what you really want is arctangent, i.e.
(not addressing if using TAN is correct or not):
In Excel 2007, both the worksheet funcion and VBA return -11.8641847236695 for tan(209).
It appears VB is like Excel where is assumes the input value for Tangent is in radians.
You are trying to plot tan from -10..10.
This function goes to +/-inf (for example tan(pi/2)) so the autoscale tries to plot from -inf to inf...
You are looking for either: [System.ArcTan (hyper-link)] or [Math.ArcTan2 (hyper-link)].
You might find ArcTan2 to be more appropriate depending on your needs.
The [Wikipedia article on the subject (hyper-link)] might help you understand the difference between ArcTan2 and ArcTan.
[ (hyper-link)]This code creates a figure and one subplot for tangent function.
Tangent of 90 degrees is not defined (sin/tan = 1/0, division by zero is not defined).
The standard C math.h functions are available:
atan2(y, x) is the same thing as atan(y/x), but it can deal properly with the case where x = 0 (i.e.
Always use atan2(y,x) instead of atan(y/x), for two reasons.
The other is that atan2() deals with the full range from -π to +π, whereas atan() only gives you an output between -π/2 and +π/2, and cannot distinguish between (x,y)=(2,2) and (x,y)=(-2,-2) since you lose the sign information when you do the division and pass only the quotient y/x into atan().
You should be able to use atan2 from the math functions.
Use [the atan function (hyper-link)].
tan-1(100/100) on the calculator is the equivalent to atan(100/100) in Php.
Since you have both rise and run what you really want to use is [atan2() (hyper-link)], which will handle the difference between e.g.
I understand that this is not how one usually visualizes the tangent function:
First of all: Under no circumstance should tan(3.14) be +0.0014; you've pasted it with the wrong sign.
atan is arcustangens, i.e.
the inverse to tan, so it's completely unrelated.
your Math.tan function uses radians.
3.14 is "pretty close, but a little smaller" than pi, and sin(3.14) is thus pretty close, but a little bigger than 0, cos(3.14) is thus pretty close, but a little smaller (in absolute terms) than -1, so tan(3.14) is a little less than 0.
EDIT: tan x = sin x/cos x, to explain my calculations above.
Following what parameters you know, the tangent could give the angle or deep  or size of FOV:
Well, tan(pi/2) in radians is essentially infinite, isn't it?
See [these graphs of sin/cos/tan (hyper-link)] to see what I mean, remembering that pi/2 radians is 90 degrees.
The trig functions in C++ (std::sin, std::cos, std::tan, etc) take arguments of radians not degrees
Just check if the degree value is 270, 90, or any other value where the tangent is NaN
tan^-1 of value and some more text because it's too short.
The function you're looking for is [double atan(double tangent) (hyper-link)] which, given the tangent, will return the angle in radians.
Like most mathematical functions, tan() is overloaded for the various
floating point types:
There is no build in function for that, since 1 radian = 180/pi degrees you can do the following using [Math.atan() (hyper-link)] and [Math.PI (hyper-link)]
math.atan(x)
Return the arc tangent of x, in radians.
The [math.atan() (hyper-link)] function - and many of the other functions in the [math (hyper-link)] module - return their results in radians.
Return the arc tangent of x, in radians.
Partially solving your equation gives atan(-5*x) == -60.
This clearly has no solution since the range of atan is only defined from -pi to pi.
The correct equation is 3*atan(-5*x) == -pi.
However, you need to convert before passing the argument into tan.
I believe you need [numpy.arctan (hyper-link)]:
functions like cos, sin and tan are in the standard library and can be used by including math.h.
tan is a C function, please refer to this page [http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/tan (hyper-link)]
Especially it is said:
Therefore its tangent is very large, but not infinite.
[schmitdt9's link to the tan docs (hyper-link)] are useful, but the important note is this one:
To your question "how i should print tan(90) as undefined in console," the answer is you'll need to special-case it.
If so, print infinite, otherwise call tan.
If you want speed and aren't too fussed about accuracy then use the float version of tan (ftan).
Best you can do is cache the result of tan(pi) and tan(pi/2) and use the precomputed values when you think you might need them.
For instance, tan(90°) is ~1.633E16 -- a very large number -- because you're asking for the tan of a number that's very close to 90°, but not exactly that.
As an aside, some locales use a decimal comma (in fact that is the ISO standard).
Lua simply wraps the standard C sin/cos functions - see [lmathlib.c (hyper-link)]1
As far as how the standard C functions are implemented, see
[How does C compute sin() and other math functions?
27.2° are 0.4747 radians: [tan(0.4747rad) (hyper-link)]
Draw tan-tan-radii circle in that plane with radii equal to S4's, tangent to S1 and S2 (not S3).
Where the float bias = 0.005 * tan( acos ( N_L_dot ) ); generated 15 instructions estimating 8 clock cycles to complete.
I think your problem quite simple - tan function has a discontinuity at x=pi/2 + pi*k. Change definition of x.
The C standard, or indeed the common but by no means ubiquitous IEEE754 floating point standard, give no guarantee of the accuracy of tan (Cf sqrt).
Accepting that the fault is not due to your value of pi (worth a check although note that because pi is transcendental it can't be represented exactly in any floating point system), if you want a well-behaved tan function across the whole domain, you'll be better off using a third party mathematics library.
It is impossible to pass π/2 to tan or tanf because π is irrational, so any floating-point number, no matter how precise, will be at least slightly different from π/2.
Therefore, tanf(ValValue) returns the tangent of some value close to π/2, and that tangent is large but not infinite.
The tangent of that number is approximately −22877332.4289, and the closest value representable in float is −22877332, which is the result you got.
So your tanf is giving you the best possible result for the input number you gave it.
Its because M_PI != real pi because it cannot be represented, so what you get from M_PI is approximation of pi, which its tangent is what you get.
But most importantly I initialised the array sum s to 0 instead of x, because the first term value (which is x) is taken care of in the first iteration, as both arrays have the values of 1 as their first element.
Try using tanf() instead of tan().
The argument to tan is an angle, either in radians or degrees, and any angle greater than 2*Pi radians or 360 degrees is equivalent to an angle less than that; angles "wrap around".
So, 10 ^ 2020 ~ 280 if the argument to tan is understood to be degrees.
The tangent of 280 degrees should be easy to calculate.
Even without knowing whether the angle is given in radians or in degree (a very important detail), the answer is that the fastest method is using a constant.
By default, gcc uses an optimization where standard library functions are replaced with special instructions under the expectation that they do what they should do.
-fno-builtin-tan to turn off the optimization for the tan function.
That header might contain a macro named tan or an inline definition, which might cause the problems you observe.
More importantly, you might want to read this article called "What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic"
[http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html (hyper-link)]
Whether in degrees, radians, or gradians, inv tan takes a slope and returns an angle.
Doing an inv tan of a gradian doesn't make sense.
You don't do an "inverse tan of a gradian".
You convert to gradian after doing an inverse tan on a slope.
sec is not a standard C function, so you have to define it yourself.
You then can use a NSAffineTransform instance to transform the coordinates of your drawings.
You might want to pass -O2 -ffast-math -mtune=native as optimizations flags to g++ (beware that -ffast-math is not standard compliant in the details of optimization)
And some processors have machine instructions for sin, cos and tan but they might not be used (because the compiler or libm know that they are slower than a routine).
the trig functions are not as accurate aa the other math functions on the x86, so sin / cos will not give the same result as tan, which is something you should bear in mind if IEEE compliance is your reason for asking this.
Computing tan to the same accuracy is more work.
The compiler can not therefore substitute sin/cos without breaking the standard.
A simple one would be to use a special case for x near pi + k*pi/2, letting atan(c*tan(x)) = +- pi/2 depending on whether x is slightly smaller, or slightly larger, than pi/2 respectively.
When running ContTangents(pi/2-exp(-36),2) (the problem value in the OP's example below), I found this very peculiar behavior.
which you could use to do something like tan(toRadians(45)).
I suggest you lessen down the tangent line's y scale from 100 to a small number like 5, and then you can scale down the coordinates of the grid accordingly:
That's probably because tan(45) is 1, and the rest is a rounding error.
As further information, floating points on most systems are usually represented using the IEEE754 standard.

With [perspective projection (hyper-link)], the projected size of the object depends on the distance to the camera.
This is just an empirical formula that should give a suitable distance depending on the height of the window and the field of view.
Sin and Cos are defined in the System unit because they're assembler system calls, whereas Tan is classically implemented as simply sin θ / cos θ. Nowadays, Tan is implemented in assembler as well, but since it was originally defined in the Math unit, that's where it continues to reside.
try Math.Tan or add Math to your uses clause.
[tan() (hyper-link)]
Use deg2rad() function inside tan() to convert value from Degrees into Radians.
Your wording is a bit confusing... but what I understand is that you have a point in the 2D space and you want to advance it a particular distance (hypotenuse) aiming a specified angle above the horizon.
The tan() has a singularity at this point and so does x - tan(x).
This is standard geometric orientation -- angles are measured as a counter-clockwise rotation from --------> directly to the right.
In order to use the standard geometric equation, we have to mirror our entire universe so that the X and Y axes are flipped.
This means that the precision limit for the cos, sin and tan methods is up to about 1000 digits, but the actual figure depends on the precision of the argument passed to them.
This is why your program fails when you try and calculate the tan of an argument with more than 500 digits to a precision of more than 500 digits.
Code is not asking for the tangent of 90°, but the tangent of a number, in radians, close to 90°.
The solution is to perform degrees range reduction first and then call tan(d2r(x)).
The best I could do is to split the range into a list of smaller ranges that do not include singularities, using the knowledge of the specific function tan(pi*x):
It seems like you provide the argument to [tan (hyper-link)] in [degrees (hyper-link)].
If you insist on using degrees, you'll find [tand (hyper-link)] useful:
atan is available in OPL scripting so you could do
Note that this only converges in the interval (-1,1), which you can check with the atan function from the math package.
The instructions fsin, fcos, and fptan are not accurate to 1.0 ulp as Intel claims:
[http://notabs.org/fpuaccuracy/ (hyper-link)]
In order to achieve 1 ULP accuracy for multiples of pi, the internal constant M_PI should have about 106 bit accuracy (or 128 for long doubles).
... is there some mathematical or practical argument that allows one to conclude that, ... the precision of floating-point values will always be such that tan(x) will fit in a finite representation of these values?
π is an irrational number, as is some_odd_integer*π/2 - the poles of math tangent(some_radian_measure).
Thus no double is an integer multiple of π/2 and tan(some_finite_double) is never a pole.
When this is true, then tan(a) is large.
Such a value a off of a some_odd_n*π/2 by 2-62 results in a tan() of about 262, well within double range of 21023.
This key point is that for some FP type to have tan(a) exceed FP_MAX, a must be very close to some_odd_n*π/2, on the order of log2(FP_MAX).
Note: tan() first step is argument reduction to the primary range [-π/2...π/2].
This, IMO, is harder to do well than primary tan() evaluation.
Thus the quality (or lack) of a tan() implementation may yield dramatically larger (and incorrect) results with values near some_odd_n*π/2.
The mathematically correct values of tangent at these two numbers are not particularly large, about -2.2E7 and 1.3E7, which is rather far from the IEEE-754 limit of ~3E38 for 32-bit binary numbers.
This, however, tells nothing about the behaviour of tan for large arguments.
Second, for some odd number N, the representation of N*π/2 could land sufficiently close to the true mathematical value to yield a value of tan outside of the representable range.
These two observations combined mean that one needs to exhaustively test a particular implementation of tan for all values of interest.
Here's a practical demonstration that a correctly-rounded tan(x) is never infinite for any finite IEEE 754 binary64 double x; in fact, it can never exceed 2.2e+18.
Going beyond that, heuristic arguments suggest that it's extremely unlikely that tan(x) could overflow for any IEEE 754 binary floating-point format, but I'm not aware of any proof, and I suspect no known proof exists.
But the subproblem for fixed exponent e can be solved by finding the continued-fraction expansion of 2^(e+1) / π: standard number-theoretic results state that the minimum of |n - m 2^(e+1) / π| is guaranteed to come from either a convergent or a semi-convergent n / m to 2^(e+1) / π.
With those digits, we create Fraction instances HALF_PI_LOWER and HALF_PI_UPPER representing tight lower and upper bounds for π/2:
The tangent of that value will be roughly ±1/4.687165924254628e-19, or 2.133485385753704e+18, and indeed that's the value that the math library on my machine produces:
Thus no finite binary64 float has a tangent exceeding 2.133485385753704e+18.
The tangent of 90 degrees is not defined.
You probably should have gotten NaN as the result from your tan() call, unless in your conversion it didn't go to exactly PI/2 radians.
You'd be better off using the constants supplied for this purpose:
Your variant results are due to your conversion from degrees to radians is not executed properly to get the expected tan() result.
It is not a "tan(PI/2) is undefined" issue.
It is a degrees to radians and tangent(x near 90 degrees) issue.
More likely the value you had was more like 1.570796324... for the tangent of that number is about 397802904.
tan(x) is extraordinarily sensitive to slight variation about PI/2 and since you likely used slightly different values of PI and/or your functions are every so slightly different, you got massively different answers.
Regardless of your precision, your can not represent Pi exactly in floating point notation and thus tan(MACHINE_APPROXIMATE_PI/2) will not equal 0.
To determine the tan_degree() for other angles, similar angle reduction is needed.
yup your understanding is correct.
Because feature support can vary across Android devices, the  element serves an important role in letting an application describe the device-variable features that it uses.
Is my understanding right?
You are correct in your understanding.

Both [x*tan(x) (hyper-link)] and [x*cot(x) (hyper-link)] have explicit regions of monotonicity, each containing one root (with some adjustments based on the comparison of b and the value of the function at the left boundary 0).
The [tan :: Floating a => a -> a (hyper-link)] takes an angle in radians.
In C, tan and other trigonometric functions expect radians as their arguments, not degrees.
That's the tangent of your angle (30 radians.)
if you are looking for the tangent of 30 degrees, you must convert your angle to radians first.
I guess in C the tan Function requires you to Input Radians as an argument and not The actual degree value.
so for Tan 30 , you would have to convert your 30 degrees to radian.
so tan(1\6 * Pi) would give you the correct answer.
I don't think the Standard has anything to say on how accurate the transcendental functions will be.
So not a direct rounding issue with sin(), cos(), tan().
Either way, this value is 0 by the calculator's standards.
Use the definition of tan, sin/cos.
The vertical asymptotes will happen when cos = 0, so write a conditional statement such as:
    if cos(x) != 0:
        plt.plot(x, np.tan(x))
One could use the definition of the tangent to filter out those points where the cosine of x is close enough to 0.
cos, sin, and tan take an angle in radians as input and return the ratio; acos, asin, and atan take a ratio as input and return an angle in radians.
For instance,

To find specifically a string that starts with "Pro Tan", you could do:
Its tangent is about 1.633123935319536975•1016.
(The closest representable value to its tangent is 1.633123935319537•1016.)
So the best result you can get by converting 90 degrees to radians and applying tan to the result is 1.633123935319536975•1016.
Because of this, it is not possible to get ∞ from tan(x).
All numbers representable in this double format are rational, so none are exactly multiples of π/2, so none have tangents that are infinity.
However, from memory, none of those numbers are sufficiently close to an odd multiple of π/2 that their tangent is outside the finite range of this double format, which would cause the tan function to overflow to an infinity.)
You might check whether the math library you are using provides a tanpi or tanPi function.
Apple supplies tanPi with the name __tanPi.
__tanPi(x) returns tan(πx), subject to calculation errors.
__tanPi(.5) returns ∞.
tan(x) is extremely sensitive to even tiny variations in the argument around odd multiples of pi/2 because its derivative 1/cos^2(x) is also unbounded around those points.
This, along with the limited precision of the computer floating points, cause significant errors when evaluating tan around odd multiples of pi/2.
The better strategy is to first reduce the angle to the first octant [0, 45) (degrees) then use basic trig identities to derive the target value.
This will provide better precision overall, and will also give an actual inf value at 90 degrees since 0 is an exactly representable number, and tan(0) = 0.
Indeed with a = (tan(x) + sin(x)) and b = (2*tan(x)), what you wrote is:
[Math.atan2 (hyper-link)] returns its value in [radians (hyper-link)], not degrees.
The [atan2 (hyper-link)] function always [returns values between -pi and pi (hyper-link)].
Also, that range doesn't make a whole lot of sense for the tangent function.
The tangent function diverges to infinity quite quickly at multiples of pi/2, which means you're missing a lot of the interesting behavior by plotting the full y-range.
y = tan(x) (hyper-link)] helped generate the following approach:
Yes, this is possible - the tan is enough ([formulas here (hyper-link)])
Due to inaccuracies in the floating point numbers, the tangent was calculated for an angle slightly over π/2 rad (90 deg), resulting in your large negative answer.
If you want to better account for this case, you should check if b is close enough to pi/2: if it is, then the tangent is undefined.

I believe there's a simple historical reason why you can't enumerate 
over methods of built-in objects like Array for instance.
That means that all Object-instances will inherit those methods.
Say .toString() for instance.
But they don't work for an instance of an object, such as a date.
I'm posting this here because Google sent me to this question but I was wanting to know how to do this for instances of objects.
Math has static method where you can call directly like Math.abs() while Date has static method like Date.now() and also instance method where you need to create new instance first var time = new Date() to call time.getHours().
For saving your time you can use script below to get static method and deep method instance.
If you want to obtain methods from created instance, don't forget to pass the constructor of it.

%uXXXX is a [non-standard encoding scheme (hyper-link)] that has been rejected by the w3c, despite the fact that an implementation continues to live on in JavaScript land.
This will do it if you absolutely have to have this (I really do agree with the cries of "non-standard"):
You have a URL using a [non-standard encoding scheme (hyper-link)], rejected by standards bodies but still being produced by some encoders.
The function is heavily inspired by the [current standard-library implementation (hyper-link)].
You can just run a for loop for checking different instances.
Angles are in radians, not degrees, for the standard versions (i.e., a right angle is π/2), and in ‘half-rotations’ for cospi etc.
Below I use a [defaultdict (hyper-link)] which is a dict subclass from the standard library that supports default values.
The error in sin, cos and tan should be right around the precision of the number representation times the value, perhaps a bit or two off.
So, the total error from using sin/cos as opposed to a new calculation of the tangent should be about a factor of sqrt(2) greater than the error from calculating the tangent directly.
That assumes the error in sin, cos and tan are all about the same, but that's a pretty good assumption these days.
My understanding is that this is actually very simple:
That could work, but actually yields the error No algorithms are implemented to solve equation tan(x) - 1/x.
tan(x)=1/x -> x = arctan(1/x)
Note that I've used x = 1 as my initial guess, but you can always pick the middle of any of your intervals as an initial guess, as long as you don't start with 0, you may need to add an offset in the equation to handle the fact that the arctangent function yields only results in the [-pi, pi] interval.
So the equation would be x = tan(x) - 1 .
It may work and to calculate tan you need to use math.tan(x) .
But practically thinking tan(x) - 1 / x = 0 simply says the the answer for equation is 0.
If tan(x) - 1 goes to other side x would be zero.
So use, "x = math.tan(x) - 1" .
The approach here avoids using for loops and uses in-built vectorization of numpy.tan and numpy.cos.
You declare Tan with size dim, which you didn't initialize before using it:
So, dim is undefined and so is the size of Tan.
and then declare Tan with it:
You need to use tanf if you want the computation to take place in float rather than double.
First, the tan function takes a double and returns a double.
Use tanf instead which takes a float and returns a float.
Code could use atanf() to get the float result when the result is saved in a float.
I found the syntax :
plot(x -> tan(x), 1:0.0001:10, ylims=(-20, 20))
with this the x axis goes from 1 to 10 with a step of 0.0001
Math.Atan returns a value in radians.
(And conversely Math.Tan(45) is telling you the tan of 45 radians.)
Atan(1) is equal to π/4.
This means that 45 radians is equal to about 2578.31008 degrees, so the tangent you are looking for should be better expressed as tan(π/4) or if you don't mind "cheating": Math.Tan(Math.Atan(1)); // ~= 1.
Use the atan2() function.
The atan2() function computes the principal value of the arc tangent of
  y/x, using the signs of both arguments to determine the quadrant of the
  return value.
To do this for the  three points you'll need to call atan2() twice: once to find the angle of AB, and once for the angle of BC.
In this case, the only applicant with any skills from the Skillsneeded table is Derrick Tan, so he is the only result.
In the case of your questions, your options parameter would be ['Sine', 'Tan'] and nTracesPerOption is 2 (e.g.
So you'll have to forgive me because the following suggestion will only be a good solution if you stick to switching between Sine and Tan for the dropdown options.
If you select Tan first then...
I dont know any C#, but maths says that tan is not invertable, only in a small intervall.
tan(pi) = 0 and tan(0) = 0.
When asking for atan(0) it could be 0 or pi (or every multiple of pi), so the result is in the range from -pi/2 .. pi/2.
The tangent function is periodic with period pi, and is invertible only if you restrict it to a subset of its domain over which it is injective.
Usually the choice of such set is the open interval ]-pi/2, pi/2[, hence the arctan function will always return a point in that interval.
Thus, the arctan of the tangent of 10 will return 0.57522...
Note that the arctan function, defined as above, is injective and defined over all the real numbers, hence the converse of your problem [code snippet]
indeed holds for each x (except for numerical errors).
Use [code snippet] instead, where epsilon is a small positive constant.
There are numbers that cannot be represented exactly, and the tan and arctan operations are themselves only approximate.
Edit: Looking at the other answers, I realise that the main problem is probably that tan isn't invertible, but the approximation issue is worth considering too, whenever you test floating point numbers for equality.
Looking at the .net documentation for [Math.Atan (hyper-link)], atan produces a value between -π/2 and ≤ π/2, which doesn't include 10.
That I think is the usual range for arctan.
tan-1(tan(x)) == x for all x in (-PI/2, PI/2).
[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tangent.html (hyper-link)]
That shows the graph of Tan, but if you imagine reading off a value of x for a given y, (e.g.
y = 0) then depending on which "strand" of Tan you read, you will get a different answer (-pi, 0, pi...).
That's the point about Arctan(x) having more than one solution.
If arctan was restricted to only one of those strands, e.g.
-pi/2 < x < pi/2 then Arctan(tan(x)) will return x providing you have accounted for floating point errors.
EDIT: However, according to [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.math.atan.aspx (hyper-link)], the atan method already returns -pi/2 < x < pi/2 or NaN if your input is undefined.
double d = Math.Atan(1) * (180 / Math.PI);
so d will be 45 in degrees
Because the tangent function is periodic we need to normalize input angle.
[Math.Atan (hyper-link)] returns an angle, θ, measured in radians, such that -π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2, so it makes sense to normalize to that range (since it obviously won't anything within that range anyway):
[code snippet]
But in fact for this case [Double.Epsilon (hyper-link)] is too small and "If you create a custom algorithm that determines whether two floating-point numbers can be considered equal, you must use a value that is greater than the Epsilon constant to establish the acceptable absolute margin of difference for the two values to be considered equal.
For instance, Math.Atan(Math.Tan(-0.49999632679501449)) + 0.49999632679501449 will be greater than Double.Epsilon for 1.1235582092889474E+307 times.
You are incorrectly calculating the tan value.
In valueOfTan = ((firstNum * secondNum * thirdNum * (bernoulli[i])) / denominator) * (power(radian, 2 * n + 1));
And one more suggestion please pull the  double bernoulli[15] = {(1/6), (-1/30),(1/42), (-1/30), (5/66), (-691/2730),  (7/6), (-3617/510), (43867/798), (-174611/330), (854513/138), (-236364091/2730),  (8553103/6),(-23749461029/870),(8615841276005/14322) array initialization out of the for loop, as it's constant you don't need to initialize it every time unnecessarily.
cot(x) = cos(x)/sin(x) should be more numerically stable close to π/2 than cot(x) = 1/tan(x).
Another possibility is cot(x) = tan(M_PI_2 - x).
If you consider the angle between two vectors (v and w), you can also obtain the cotangent as follow (using [Eigen::Vector3d (hyper-link)]):
No machine number x can get close enough to multiples of π/2 to cause tan(x) to overflow, therefore tan(x) is well-defined and finite for all floating-point encodings for any of the IEEE-754 floating-point formats, and by extension, so is cot(x) = 1.0 / tan(x).
Using a math library with an accurate implementation of tan() with a maximum error of ~= 0.5 [ulp (hyper-link)], we find that computing cot(x) = 1.0 / tan(x) incurs a maximum error of less than 1.5 ulp, where the additional error compared to tan() itself is contributed by the rounding error of the division.
Lastly, cot(x) = tan (M_PI_2 - x) suffers from the issue of subtractive cancellation mentioned earlier when x is near M_PI_2, and from the issue that in finite-precision floating-point arithmetic, M_PI_2 - x == M_PI_2 when x is sufficiently small in magnitude.
You just need to go through all token-label pairs: if you find B-X label, then it is start of X entity (in your example - it is pair [Alex_B-PER]) , so create new entity, which first token is the token with B_X label; while the next label is I-X, append corresponding token to the created X entity (in your example - it is pair [Tan_I-PER] - so your entity is [Alex Tan_PER]).

The complete snippet below will show you how you can take the example that you've been running test on, and produce a figure that toggles between showin sine and tangent values for a few series.
There are libraries that can help with this, but you'll need a good understanding of what you are doing.
It is possible the winner is in fact 'tan' at the end of every race.
You can increase randomization by for instance initializing the seed before every call, or only at the top of your code.

IE9 I am not sure about, but Microsoft has stated they intend to support the EMCAScript 5 standard eventually.
When x is in the set described above {..., -pi/2, pi/2, 3pi/2, ...}, it means cos(x) == 0, and sin(x)/cos(x) causes a division by zero error, whereas tan(x) approaches a value of inf.
Therefore, at those values, tan(x) ~= sin(x)/cos(x).
After the assumption is made that cos(x) ~= 0, MATLAB properly stated that tan(x) == sin(x)/cos(x) is true, yet it still didn't simplify the expression.
I can't claim to have a good understanding of module augmentation, but I have done it in my own app (also for custom colors in the palette) and when I use the same approach as in my own app, it works for your scenario.
My understanding is that you only have to specify the augmentation -- you don't need to create new types extending the existing ones.
D Stanley has given the correct way to test for "equality" within some absolute tolerance: (abs(a-b) < tol) where tol is some small number you choose to fit your expected precision.
Second, the processor, and thus the calling math library, has separate internal procedures for the computation of tan and (sin, cos).

That would be [Math.Atan (hyper-link)] and [Math.Atan2 (hyper-link)].
This method takes one paremeter of type double, which represents a tangent and returns a double, which represents
There is also faster formula for computing tanh, requiring only one exp(), because tanh is related to logistic function:
tanh(x) = 2 / (1 + exp(-2 * x)) - 1
also
tanh(x) = 1 - 2 / (1 + exp(2 * x))
If you'd like to alternatively use radians use the standard cos() and sin() functions.
Wolfram Alpha [also reports an infinite value for ∫tan(x)dx at pi/2 (hyper-link)], so I'm not sure where you got the value of ~7.
The right way to convert vector to angle is through atan2 function:
You would then call it using calculateTan(180) which then would return 0.
All this can then be applied to Math.atan and the other inverse functions.
The regex variable will be used to match string 'sin' OR string 'cos' OR string 'tan'.
You declare tantab to have dimension 0:
Some things to think about: The loop DO i=1,61,1 suggests that you should be setting TanTab(i), not TanTab(j).
And since the loop goes from 1 to 61 suggests that you should declare TanTab as real, dimension (1:61) :: TabTab, otherwise its not going to be large enough to store the values.
upper bound of integral connected to number of items in TanTab array
tan_y is a numpy.dnarray, it represents the ordinates of the mathematical [tan (hyper-link)] function, previously defined.
tan_y[:-1] extracts each element of the array, until the last, excluded.
So, tan_y[:-1] is a way to remove the last element of this array, therefore tan_y[:-1] is 599 element long.
np.diff(tan_y) calculates the 'derivative' of tan_y, see the [documentation (hyper-link)].
Important note: the result dx is 1 element shorter then x, because of the way the calculation is done.
This is the reason why you need to remove the last element of the tan_y at the previous point: tan_y and np.diff(tan_y) have to have the same length in order to be compared.
np.diff(tan_y) < 0 generates a boolean array of the same length of np.diff(tan_y), in this case 599, where:

if a i-th element of np.diff(tan_y) is positive, the i-th element of np.diff(tan_y) < 0 is set to False
if a i-th element of np.diff(tan_y) is negative, the i-th element of np.diff(tan_y) < 0 is set to True

This is a way to create a filter: an array of True and False according to a specified condition.
tan_y[:-1][np.diff(tan_y) < 0] applies the filter you created at the point 4. to the array you generated in the point 2.
tan_y[:-1][np.diff(tan_y) < 0] = np.nan sets to NaN the elements of tab_y where its derivative is negative.
I assume you know that tan(x) is a increasing monotone function.
This appens because plt.plot() does not know it is plotting a tan(x), which has asymptotes.
In order to better understanding this, I replot the previuos plot, with a small number of points (30) and this options:
is a way to set to NaN the values of tan_y when its derivative is negative: exactly in correspondence of the vertical lines, so as to remove them!
a clean, smooth tan(x) graph without its asymptotes.
The problem is that core is a class variable which is created once and shared by all instances of class tile.
It should be an instance variable for each tile instance.
As mhawke points out in his answer you need to make the core an instance variable, so that each Tile gets its own core.
The root of the problem is that core is shared by all instances of the class by virtue of how you've defined it.
Personally I'd have the tile inherit from Button, but if you favor composition over inheritance I'll stick with that.
If you know what the ground sample distance of your image you can use that to determine how much distance a pixel represents and use that number to convert meters to pixels.
Ground sample distance is calculated as:
Having GSD you can then work backwards to determine number of pixels based on distance in meters (note this means you will want units to all be in meters).
Every other entry in sol is wrong because this is where we have asymptotic discontinuities (tan transitions from +Inf to -Inf), which is mistakenly recognized by MATLAB as a solution.
For this particular case, it is important to realize that fzero uses numerical derivatives to find increasingly better approximations.
But, derivatives for f(x) = x · tan(x) - 1 get increasingly difficult to accurately compute for increasing x:
Knowing that tan(x) has [Taylor expansion (hyper-link)]:
Now, key to realize is that tan(x) repeats with period π.
Don't apply the formula to the output of tan, apply it to the parameter.
Tan accepts an angle, and returns a quotient.
The angle is the input to tan.
You must pass radians to the tan function.

Further reductions are possible this way if one hard-codes the tangent values for 30° or 15°.

and that you understand what sensitive data is.
For example, showing the queue of customers in line would be OK if no names were used, but showing the names of customers might be a bad idea - they may not want it advertised that they're tanning on  your site, or may not want their abusive ex-boyfriend knowing when they can find them there, etc.
Unless Tan Track exposes a [web service (hyper-link)] (or something similar) that allows you to access their data, there is likely no (ethical) way to retrieve this information.
According to [Wolfram Alpha (hyper-link)], tan(atan(A)+C) can be written as (A+tan(C))/(1-A*tan(C)).
You can easily derive this by hand from the tangent sum formula:
tan(a + b) = (tan a + tan b)/(1 - tan a tan b).
If the implementation of tan in your math library is slow or inaccurate it's possible that faster or more precise implementations exist.
In the end, you will still need to compute a tangent, but there are things you can do to help a bit.
First, apply a simple trig identity, for the [tangent of a sum (hyper-link)].
This, combined with the fact that tan(atan(A)) = A, reduces your formula to
Thus you still need to compute ONE tangent, that of C. (Thus precompute tan(C), once.)
However, there are ways to compute a tangent more efficiently than as a ratio sin(C)/cos(C).
Or there is a trick using a series for the versine, which is itself more efficient to compute than the tangent series.
atan(A) = atan(x_a/y_a) for some point is the angle between vector (x_a,y_a) and Oy.
Because C is a constant, you can precompute some vector c=(x_c,y_c) with unit length and inclined to Oy with angle C. Then cos(atan(A)+C) can be expressed as inner product of these vectors divided by length of a.
From cos you can get tan using main identity.
Using your existing pattern, you might take out the - of the first character class, and add an extra alternative to assert a - on the left which is not directly followed by one of *,/,^,(,sin(,cos(,tan(
Math.toDegrees(Math.atan((y2-y1)/(x2-x1)))
This post [Angle between 2 points (hyper-link)] has an example using atan().
Use the [Math.atan2 (hyper-link)] function.
It is like arctan but knows about x and y coordinates, so it can handles lines that are horizontal, vertical, or pointing in other directions -- arctan's range of -pi/2 through pi/2 will not give the correct answer for some lines.
The [atan2 (hyper-link)] function helps solve this problem while avoiding boundary conditions such as division by zero.
If the point is farther away, close to an extremum of the function, the root of the tangent may be very far away.
Using the contracting fixed-point iteration: the solution around k*pi is also a root of the equivalent equation x+arctan(b*x)=k*pi.
This gives the approximate solution x=g(k*pi)=k*pi-arctan(b*k*pi).
As the arcus tangent is rather flat even for small k, this gives a good approximation.
The previous method does not work in this case as the arcus tangent has a slope around 1 in this interval.
Approximating tan(x)=x/(1-(2*x/pi)^2) gives the same poles at +-pi/2 and is sufficiently close in between.
To convert degrees to radians, use numRad = M_PI / 180.0 where M_PI should be a constant that holds the value od Pi.
If you do not have such a constant defined in a header file, just define it yourself, like #define PI 3.14159265
The functions sin, cos and tan always require arguments in radians.
To use constant M_PI see [How to use the PI constant in C++ (hyper-link)]
You need inverse trigonometric functions - atan, asin, acos.
But note that these functions are "multi-valued" (don't know exact English term), so for example you may expect -3*Pi/4  for atan of 1.0, but get main value Pi/4
math.acos() is arcos and ** is exponentiation.There is also math.tan() and math.sin().You could use dir(math) find more functions in the math module.Use the help() function to see its uses.
The tan layer is all the circles that have x and/or y differing by 1 from the gold's position.

Ang-and-Tan seems to be "linear", but pretty useless for real query scenarios.
This can be achieved easily without any trigonometry, with help of Unity's Ray class/struct, which offers handy GetPoint(float distance) method.
Getting the distance from the camera to your near raycast is trivial ( .magnitude), than instead of doing the second raycast, its enough to create a ray, and query it for a point at the given distance.

Unfortunately, StrictMath doesn't support BigDecimal, so you will have to use another library, or your own implementation of sin/cos/tan.
In the case of something like tan(90 degrees), a double can't store π/2 with infinite precision, so your input is something very close to, but not exactly, 90 degrees -- and thus, the result is something very big, but not quite infinity.
You may ask "why don't they just return Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY when you pass in the closest double to π/2," but that could lead to ambiguity: what if you really wanted the tan of that number, and not 90 degrees?
For example, the standard solution for most financial calculations is simply to compute in terms of the smallest unit of currency -- pennies, in the US -- in integers, converting to and from the display format (eg dollars and cents) only for I/O.
If you have trouble understanding the mechanisms, you might also compare these two pairs of operations,
You might want to include atan2 in your functions, as it is sometimes more useful than atan.
For example given a vector x,y atan2(y,x) gives the direction of the vector -- the angle through which to rotate (1,0) so as to get x,y -- but atan(y/x) doesn't.
You can use autonumber as the PK/FK to link associated records but use both the TAN and SN fields in queries to filter and sort.
So save tblDevices autonumber PK as FK in tblParameters and don't save TAN and SN.
I guess there is a misunderstanding on your side.
You are talking about an index on numDevice_TAN and an index on numDevice_SN, but what you really want is a foreign key on the combination of the two.
You say that you need both numDevice_TAN and numDevice_SN to identify a device.
So you need both columns numDevice_TAN and numDevice_SN in tblParameter, too.
Your code looks like it almost does what you want.. but you can store the student text "Student S001, Kitty Tan enrolled into class C001" in a variable and just print it later.. you could also try using end="" in your first print statement, which would stop it from printing a newline.. but I don't think that's as good a way to do this and it's only do-able in python3.
if you give your sample csv, it will be faster to understand.
This guarantees that the program won't continue unless the function is either sin, cos, or tan.
using the double_math class the names are arc_sine, arc_cosine, arc_tangent.
There is no argument function like atan2.
More idiomatic would be to define
an object type to contain the two tables, with a constructor
which initialized them, and declare a static instance of this:
So 1/2 + Math.Tan(0) + 1/2 is equivalent to 0 + 0 + 0.
Like you've said, some transcendental functions like [sine (hyper-link)], [cosine (hyper-link)] and [tangent (hyper-link)] are available as assembly instructions in the x86 architecture.
These are likely how the C library implements sin(), cos(), tan() and friends.
Here is an example of my custom tangent function (forgive the Visual Studio assembly syntax):
The processor likely implements tan() and cos() as native instructions (hardwired or microcode) FPTAN (x87+) and FCOS (387+) for the x86/87 (87 coming from the original math coprocessor, Intel 8087).
So ideally your environment should generate and execute native x87 instructions, namely FCOS and FPTAN (partial tan).
that handle  functions such log(), tan(), cos(), so that is not an (direct) option, but the SIMD instructions are great for doing interpolation from previously computed results or from a table.
Such as [-ffast-math (hyper-link)] which can be dangerous if you do not understand the implications.
The rounding option may be suffice if the speed issue is merely related to the difference between the x87's native 80-bit extended precision and the 64-bit IEEE 754 standard double precision numbers.
The first is more implementation oriented while the second is very  comprehensive yet still easy to understand.
With either of those books you should be able to understand the precision vs. speed trade-offs for you situation and write a sufficient implementation.
Avoid calling both tan and cos on the same argument - use sincos or a trig identity.
It seems like it's better to compute sin instead of cos - the reason is that you can use it for tan_w1 = sin_w1/sqrt(1.0 - sin_w1*sin_w1).
Using cos, which I originally suggested, loses the proper sign when computing tan.
I ran into one annoying problem - the sin approximation error near ±pi/2 can put the value slightly outside [-1, 1] and that (1) causes the computation of tan to be invalid and (2) causes outsized effects when the log argument is near 0.
There is small logical error in your program , everytime you write an expression in C all the variables or constants are converted into a same type , now when your are dividing 1 and 4 the compiler understands them both as integers and it calculates it and yields the final expression in integer only due to type conversion carried on by default .

Don't use tangent?
What are you using tangent for?
So looking at the [Web Color Chart (hyper-link)], a light tan is #CFC996.
The argument to Math.tan is an angle in radians.
Since ChipTAN only provides a TAN, you will need the PIN anyway to release the transaction, so there is no benefit to ask for it.
When all else fails, one could probably obtain a decent value by estimating the result of an infinite series of the arctan function.
The [Wikipedia page on inverse trigonometic functions (hyper-link)] has a section on the [infinite series (hyper-link)] of inverse trigonometric functions, including arctan.
As for the reason why the arctan function is not included, it is probably because the processor in the Blackberry isn't very powerful, and would take a lot of processor resources to perform the calculation.
Also, looking at the Blackberry JDE 4.2 API documentation, there appears to be a fixed-point math library called [Fixed32 (hyper-link)] which offers two flavors of arctan.
From [Arctan in J2ME by Stephen Zimmerman (hyper-link)]:
First implement the standard arctan(x) using Taylor series (as described at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_trigonometric_functions#Infinite_series (hyper-link)])
The do the following before calling arctan:
2) if |x| > 1, compute arctan(1/x) and finally subtract the result from Pi/2
3) if |x| is close to 1, compute arctan of the half angle using the half angle formula 
arctan(x) = 2*arctan(x/(1+sqrt(1+x*x))).
Otherwise, for |x| close to 1, arctan converges very slowly.
Else if the conditional is satisfied as the user wants the sin tangent etc... then only scan for one number .
The point you report, which is approximately zero, is a valid root for your equation x-tan(x)=0.
I also recommend you read the Wikipedia page on root finding (here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-finding_algorithm (hyper-link)]) in depth to gain a better understanding of the subject.
You need to either use the standard library function pow() from <math.h> to calculate powers, or use the scientific notation:
Also note that this is not math, this is C, and you cannot write tan ^ 2(argument), you can only call a function and not a "function squared" as in math notation...
You shouldn't be using an item defined in the Layout XML in order to create more instances of it.

Ok, so if I understand this, you've got your frame parallel to the XY plane, and sitting at Z=-1, with your camera/eye at the origin.
So does it work and you're just trying to understand it?
For instance your invWidth and invHeight variables both divide integer 1 by something.
If you have a function F() that does e^x, where e is the constant, and x is any number, then you can do this: (a is base, b is exponent, ln is log-e)
For instance for a lot of my male friends(myself among them) there are only a few colors(red, blue, green, yellow), while a lot of my female friends have at least 20 words for pink.
I would recommend using a [neural network (hyper-link)] of some kind(for instance use [backpropagation (hyper-link)] with 3 input neurons - for red, green and blue).
Just give in some colors (red: 255, 0, 0, ...) and say that everything in the euclidean distance of x is the same color.
distance(red, color) = sqrt((red.r - color.r)^2 + (red.g - color.g)^2 + (red.b - color.b)^2)
Or just measure all distances and get the shortest as color.
You could then simply compare the color distance to each of your colors (you can find reasonable RGB values for common color names [here (hyper-link)]) and choose the one with the smallest distance.
magnitude(I)= sqrt(x(I)^2+y(I)^2), 
angle(I)= atan2(y(I), x(I))[ *180 / pi ]
The second is easier to write:

It's Because your for loop executes so fast that you can't notice that the change of the text.First i is 0,and then it becomes 1,then the text will be "Please enter the TAN code for Index number 1" ......
It's not easy to imagine what your code does without seeing your declarations of indexNumber, tanCode, index, and, in particular, add.
If you want 100 buttons, you'll need to have an array or List of buttons to press, where each has a different tan code.
If you want one button that repeatedly asks for the different tans, then you have to assign the data for click i + 1 only after click i has been handled, i.e.
Using a double as a loop index is not to everyone's taste (you can get yourself into trouble if you are not using whole numbers), but this is fine in this instance, particularly also as you are using <= as the stopping condition.
the calculations for sinx, cosx, tanx and the printing of the new line should be inside the curlies {}.
Do you mean arc tangent?
There is a function called atan() for that, which gives you your angle in radians.
vat theta = Math.atan(y/x)
take for instance this situation:
Anyhow, [IEEE 754 (hyper-link)] is the floating point standard typically implemented by modern CPUs.
It's useful to understand the basics of it, as this gives you a lot of intuition about what not to do.
The most important reason is that floating-point numbers have a limited number of digits, e.g..doubles have 53 bits.
The second problem are functions with a very steep slope like tangent of x near pi/2.
tan(11) has a slope of 50000 which means that any small deviation caused by rounding errors
before will be amplified by the factor 50000 !
This happens due to singularities of the tangent function (i.e., having x values around those points).
Else java thinks that you're multiplying the entire expression by Math.tan ((Math.PI) / nSides).
So given they have equal precedence, your division by 4 will be evaluated before the multiplication by Math.tan.
First, let's understand what is (probably) happening.
np.tanh is trying to delegate the task to the elements of array.
In this running code I don't see a tanh, so I don't know what kinds of arrays are using that.
This means "cos" or "tan" or "sin\d\D", but you want
Which is "cos", "tan" or "sin" followed by "\d\D".
sin|cos|tan
Where inputAngle is the angle you want your gradient to be.
The condition states the number is over 0 and less tan 11, so I have no idea why you're comparing 11 with null there...

This is how it looks with 0 offset (the grid has 0.1 units distance in this picture):
-fFov was the calculated tan of theta/2 but how can headY be added to directly?
Technically headZ should be either used to calculated the near plane distance or be derived from it.
Anyway the main ideas is, that the head is located at some distance from the projection plane, and the center point is shifted in relative units of the projection.
So you must scale relative headX, headY with the actual head distance to the projection plane to make the apex correction work.
If you import numpy, I suggest using arctan2 instead of arctan ([see this doc (hyper-link)]).
If not, you can solve this problem with atan2 function of math library and zip built-in function :
Not sure if I understand your problem, however it seems that the solutions in the two plots are the same but they are plotted differently.

You might be interested in Math.atan2.
It doesn't show up because the standard output is line-buffered, and you didn't include a newline.
From [https://github.com/mheilman/tan-clustering/blob/master/class_lm_cluster.py (hyper-link)] :
If I understand correctly, the algorithm gives you a tree and you need to truncate it at some level to get clusters.
Also, since the
  total numbers of cluster tokens and pairs are constant across pairs,
  this code use counts instead of probabilities.
To convert a vector from x and y to magnitude and angle I have read that I for the angle have to use the function tan^-1(y/x).
I think you're trying to compute a value that represents the sin, cos or tan of a value, but that doesn't mean you need to assign to np.sin, etc.
As there were ( and still there are ) many helpfull functions directly available via ANSI-control-sequences, historically there were implementations, that have used this console features to create an independent char-based GUI on a standard console screen that worked as menu-systems, cursor-navigated turtle graphics, simple games, syntax-highlighting and other position/colour navigation and many other smart utilities.
Code looks fine I think that the problem is that you give angle in degrees and you should provide radians to tan function.

You can override the default with instance.defaults.timeout or pass it as an option to your call.
Math isn't my strong point - so perhaps someone else will provide a better answer, but to get all 4 quadrants, you need to use atan2.
I seem to recall it has to do with a check for a value of 0 (that Math.atan doesn't do).
You can use [numpy.where (hyper-link)], and the where parameter to [np.divide (hyper-link)] and [np.tan (hyper-link)].
np.divide and np.tan's where argument tells them to only do their operation at locations that are true in another array, and leave some the other elements uninitialized (so they could be anything, but it doesn't matter, because we're not going to use them here).
I would suggest that their answer can be further enhanced by using the out keyword of tan and divide to avoid allocating and copying unnecessary temporary arrays:
So for instance, to keep also capital letters and spaces it would be:

To that end we define a set of incremental angles a0, ..., an-1, such that ak = atan(0.5k).
Considering that we may both add and subtract ak, and that tan(ak) = sin(ak)/cos(ak), we get:
yk+1 = cos (ak) * (yk ∓ xk * tan(ak)) = cos (sk+1)
xk+1 = cos (ak) * (xk ± yk * tan(ak)) = sin (sk+1)
yk+1 = y ∓ xk * tan(ak)
xk+1 = x ± yk * tan(ak)
Because of our choice of ak, the multiplications with tan(ak) turn into simple right shifts if we compute in fixed-point arithmetic.
You shouldn't be using trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan, etc.
Each
  column of the matrix represents the instances in a predicted class,
  while each row represents the instances in an actual class.
Now see the formula of Accuracy and Error Rate from your book (Chapter 4, 4.2), and you should be able to clearly understand what is a confusion matrix.
I'm not yet sure what mistake is happening in the tangent calculation.
For the phase you want to use  atan for the arctangent.
To get the phase of the number you need tan^-1 which in matlab is atan ([inv (hyper-link)] is matrix inverse).
