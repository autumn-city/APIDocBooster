Would you even want to override [Activity|ViewGroup|View].dispatchTouchEvent?  Unless you are doing some custom routing you probably should not.
The main extension methods are ViewGroup.onInterceptTouchEvent if you want to spy and/or intercept touch event at the parent level and View.onTouchListener/View.onTouchEvent for main event handling. 
"For example, the simplest case is that of View.dispatchTouchEvent which will route the touch event to either OnTouchListener.onTouch if it's defined or to the extension method onTouchEvent. "
"So in case you are working with these 2 handlers use dispatchTouchEvent to handle on first instance the event, which will go to onInterceptTouchEvent. "
