As per the documentation we need to specify num_features parameter which is the input size of tensor. 
Batch normalization works when batch size is greater than 1, so an input of shape (1, 32) won't work. 
In most cases you should be safe with the default setting. 
For both functions, the d1 parameter is the number of features, and equals dim C of the input tensor.
