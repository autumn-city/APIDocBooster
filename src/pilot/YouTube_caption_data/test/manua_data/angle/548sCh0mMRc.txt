Dear Fellow Scholars, this is Two Minute Papers
with Dr. Károly Zsolnai-Fehér.
In computer graphics research, we spend most
of our time dealing with images.
An image is a bunch of pixels put onto a 2D
plane, which is a tiny window into reality,
but reality is inherently 3D.
This is easy to understand for us, because
if we look at a flat image, we see the geometric
structures that it depicts.
If we look at this image, we know that this
is not a sticker, but a three dimensional
fluid domain.
If I would freeze an image and ask a human
to imagine rotating around this fluid domain,
that human would do a pretty good job at that.
However, for a computer algorithm, it would
be extremely difficult to extract the 3D structure
out from this image.
So, can we use these shiny new neural network-based
learning algorithms to accomplish something
like this?
Well, have a look at this new technique that
takes a 2D image as an input, and tries to
guess three things.
The cool thing is that the geometry problem
we talked about is just the first one.
Beyond that, two, it also guesses what the
lighting configuration is that leads to an
appearance like this, and three, it also produces
the texture map for an object as well.
This would already be great, but wait, there
is more.
If we plug all this into a rendering program,
we can also specify a camera position, and
this position can be different from the one
that was used to take this input image.
So what does that mean exactly?
Well, it means that maybe, it can not only
reconstruct the geometry, light and texture
of the object, but even put this all together
and make a photo of it from a novel viewpoint!
Wow.
Let’s have a look at an example!
There is a lot going on in this image, so
let me try to explain how to read it.
This image is the input photo, and the white
silhouette image is called a mask, which can
either be given with the image, or be approximated
by already existing methods.
This is the reconstructed image by this technique,
and then, this is a previous method from 2018
by the name category-specific mesh reconstruction,
CMR in short.
And, now, hold on to your papers, because
in the second row, you see this technique
creating images of this bird from different,
novel viewpoints!
How cool is that!
Absolutely amazing.
Since we can render this bird from any viewpoint,
we can even create a turntable video of it.
And all this from just one input photo.
Let’s have a look at another example!
Here, you see how it puts together the final
car rendering in the first column from the
individual elements, like geometry, texture,
and lighting.
The other comparisons in the paper reveal
that this technique is indeed a huge step
up from previous works.
Now, this all sounds great, but what is all
this used for?
What are some example applications of this
3D object from 2D image thing?
Well, techniques like this can be a great
deal of help in enhancing the depth perception
capabilities of robots, and of course, whenever
we would like to build a virtual world, creating
a 3D version of something we only have a picture
of can get extremely laborious.
This could help a great deal with that too.
For this application, we could quickly get
a starting point with some texture information,
and get an artist to fill in the fine details.
This might get addressed in a followup paper.
And if you are worried about the slight discoloration
around the beak area of this bird, do not
despair.
As we always say, two more papers down the
line, and this will likely be improved significantly.
What a time to be alive!
