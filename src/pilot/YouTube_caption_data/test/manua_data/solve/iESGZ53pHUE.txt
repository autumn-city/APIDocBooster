Hi everyone! In the last video we
discussed
why we choose solving a real world
problem
on the kaggle platform for learning deep
learning in this video we are going to
look at
the four different steps for solving
most of the deep learning problems
the first step is identifying the data
for the problem that you're trying to
solve
let's say for example you want to
identify
whether a particular lung has got
a symptom of a coronavirus or COVID-19
You have to identify the right data the
training data and the labeled data set
and then the second step is you need a
model. What is a model?
and most of the engineering terms let's
see the model as a function
which takes some input and generates
some output.
In this case, the model takes all our
images
as an input and it generates an output
saying whether this
the particular image has got corona or not.
so the third thing is how do you train a
model?
in general most of the models do not
have any idea about the particular use
case that we're talking about. say
it can be as simple as identifying a dog
versus character or identifying
whether a particular text is toxic or
not or
some other problems. Let's say for example
you're building an application for
self-driving car
and you want to know whether you have to
stop the car or continue the car based
on a simple
traffic signal right so you have to
train the model for that particular task
so that's what the training loop comes
that's where the model
is shown the target images that we
prepared in the first step
and the feedback is provided to the
model saying that oh you're actually
wrong you have to improve yourself
and there are different ways to improve
it which we'll be covering in the coming videos and
coming lessons.
And the fourth part is generating
predictions on unseen data or new data
that is you want to deploy a model at
different places. This could be starting from very
simple ones like you generate a file.
Let's say for example you're using
amazon platform to buy some groceries or
buy some toys for your kid or you want
to watch a movie on Netflix
right? so these platforms take all your
characteristics and
generate recommendations probably once
in a day or
once in an hour or in different
intervals.
This could go into a database these are
called offline recommendations or
offline predictions. This is one of the
most simplest
predictions that you can make. It can
range from here
to something it can happen in real-time.
Let's say the model has to be deployed
on a car self-driving car like tesla
where the model has to identify whether
it has to stop
when it sees probably a pig approaching
the
road or a deer walking by road or a
pedestrian
crossing the road on some kind of
emergency it has to know it has to stop
irrespective of whether the driver is in
his full alert or not
right and in this case the deployment is
much more complex because you don't have
very high end hardware sitting on the
car you have limited processing power
and you
have the latency that has to be fraction
of seconds much faster than what a human
being can process so these are the four
key
steps that
any deep learning problem constitutes
of right.
So let's look at each of these steps in
much
more detail.
