 And let's see what happens when config changes, how it affects the activity.  So, on configuration change, the Android first shuts down the activity by calling method in sequence, that is onPause, then onStop and then onDestroy. 
 The implementation of onPause is very fast because the next activity is not resumed until this method returns.  And is either followed by onResume, if the activity returns back to the front, or onStop, if the activity is becoming invisible to the user.  This is how we implement this onPause callback method. 
On other hands, if some new Activity occurs and occupies the full screen so that your previously running activity is disappeared.  In this Case, your previously running activity is moved to Back Stack. Here, onPause() + onStop() are called.
For example, it is not uncommon to implement one with an Activity whose theme is set to that of a dialog.  In this case, displaying the dialog-as-an-Activity will cause the new Activity to be on the top of the stack, pausing what previously was there.
Then Activity A's state changes from paused to stopped state (which calls  onStop on Activity A) .  onStop is called because Activity B was full screen  non transparent activity. (If Activity B is non-full-sized or transparent then onStop is NOT called on Activity A)
