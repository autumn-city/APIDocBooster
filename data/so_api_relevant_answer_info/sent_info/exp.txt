But I found [this (hyper-link)] clearer in explaining the answer.
Let’s say you have the master, exp1, and exp2 branches.
You want to merge one file from each of the experimental branches into master.
To explain further with an example, let's say you want to merge branchX into the current branch:
But I found [this Git blog (hyper-link)] clearer in explaining the answer.
And you'll have a lot of explaining to do in that commit message.
If you only need to merge a particular directory and leave everything else intact and yet preserve history, you could possibly try this... create a new target-branch off of the master before you experiment.
Even though exp was correctly creating the missing distribution certificates and push certificates for me, it was somehow having a hard time with the provisioning profile.
Then choose the 'I will provide all the credentials and files needed, Expo does limited validation' option in 'exp build:ios'.
‘exp build:ios’ has a flag --apple-enterprise-account that will make things as enterprise and you won’t get that Reason:You are not allowed to perform this operation.
Export (.exp) files contain information about exported functions and data items.
When LIB creates an import library, it also creates an .exp file.
You use the .exp file when you link a program that both exports to and imports from another program, either directly or indirectly.
If you link with an .exp file, LINK does not produce an import library, because it assumes that LIB already created one.
You can use LIB with the /DEF option to create an import library and an export file.
LINK uses the export file to build a program that contains exports (usually a dynamic-link library (DLL)), and it uses the import library to resolve references to those exports in other programs.
When you link a program (either an executable file or a DLL) that contains exports, LINK automatically creates an import library that describes the exports.
Later, when you link a program that references those exports, you specify the import library.
However, when a DLL exports to a program that it also imports from, whether directly or indirectly, you must use LIB to create one of the import libraries.
When LIB creates an import library, it also creates an export file.
You must use the export file when linking one of the DLLs.

Depending on the language you use, it may be worthwhile to try different math-libraries (implemented in C/Fortran) or, depending on the number of terms to sum up, using multiple threads (as the exponentials can be calculated independently of each other)
First, [expand (hyper-link)] the expression so that the exponents are separated then do the substitution.
By default, when writing out an expression for the first time (before running it through any functions), MATLAB will try and simplify your expression and so exp(a)*exp(b) can be much better expressed using exp(a+b).
However, if you explicitly want to replace a part of the expression that is encompassed by an exponent with a base, expand the function first, then do your substitution:
How accurate did you actually expect this method to be and why?
At a high level, you should only expect your method to be accurate in a narrow region near x=0.
rickandross pointed out the source of the error in this case, namely that the Taylor expansion for exp(-100) involves differences of large values.
There's a simple modification to the Taylor attempt that get reasonable answers for the few test cases I tried, namely using the fact that exp(-x) = 1/exp(x).
The problem is expression you're using.
For small numbers exp(x) and exp(-x) are approximately equal, so exp(x)-exp(-x) is close to zero and definitely below 1.
Rewriting the expression as
exp(a)==exp(a/2)*exp(a/2), which means you really only need to calculate exp(x) for 1 < x < 2.
A nice feature of this implementation is that it supports variable precision: the precision can be determined at runtime, at the expense of range.
When using these functions, x is expected to be a fixed-point value scaled according to the
specified precision.
As a partial answer, there are instructions for exp, log or pow on some architectures yes.
Yes, exp will be faster than pow in general.
The exp and log functions will be optimized for the target platform; many techniques can be used such as Pade approximation, linear or binary reduction followed by approximation, etc.
The pow function will generally be implemented as exp(log(a) * b) as you say, so it is obviously slower than exp alone.
There are many special cases for pow such as negative exponents, integral exponents, exponents equal to 1/2 or 1/3, etc.
These will slow down pow even further in the general case because these tests are expensive.
than Math.exp (and as such I'd expect pow to be slower).
15.8.2.8 exp (x)
Returns an implementation-dependent approximation to the exponential
  function of x (e raised to the power of x, where e is the base of the
  natural logarithms).
cuComplex.h only offers some basic operations on cuComplex (principally those used inside the CUBLAS and CUFFT libraries), the exponential function is not supported.
You can implement the exponential yourself using component-wise arithmetic.
Given a complex number z = x + i*y, the exponent can be computed as:
exp(z) = exp(x) * (cos(y) + i * sin(y))
Thrust also now has support for [complex exponentials (hyper-link)].
Generally exp() is for doubles, expf() for floats and both are slightly slower than __exp() which is available as a hardware operation.
The differences are explained in the [CUDA C Programming Guide (hyper-link)], appendix D.
exp() should be used for double precision, although should be overloaded for single
expf() should be used for single precision (float)
__expf() is the fast-math version, the performance is faster with some loss of precision (dependent on the input value, see the [guide (hyper-link)] for more details).
=EXP(-((2,2/9,58)^2)) should work
By way of some explanation, in Excel (as conventional) the negation operator has [precedence (hyper-link)] over exponentiation.
The reg exp searches in a text file for records who have the following format and values:
separating the hours and minutes and seconds in the file) between 130000 and 140059 which is the part of the reg exp I extracted below, and lastly the value 801 and any number of characters that may follow.
Also I added a ^ at the start of the reg exp and $ for the end.
When the experience goes over the max, animate it up to the max and set currentXP to the amount left over in the new level.
In the completion function for that animation, set the height down to0` and animate it up to the new exp level.
Luckily, someone has already done this... the last entry (at time of writing) of this [Contributed Files (hyper-link)] page from the SQLite website is a link to extension-functions.c which claims1 to implement many mathematical functions, including exp().
Find what percentage of the experience the player has, and multiply it by the bar's maximum width.
It's giving the right answer, it's just presenting it in exponential format: 1.0e+04 * 0.0446 is the same as 445.8578.
Now lets calculate the exponential function of each of those values (rounded a bit):
Which is exactly what you expected.
Now to exponentiation.
In math, there are again overloaded versions of exp, among them:
Let's just define a function that can call sqrt an exp based on the type classes:
I would have expected you to use a formula more like (x^n/factorial(n) < g(x)) where g(x) is a formula involving x. I suggest that you go back to the text on series and determine whether a better g(x) is required for your accuracy requirements.
Instead of using the implicit literal syntax you could change to be explicit.

EXP files contain information about things exported from the DLL
.exp files are for developers too.
.exp files are created for .exe and .dll files that export some symbols.
.exp files are always created, even if the creation of the corresponding .exe or .dll fails at link time.
.exp files help linking interdependent components.
For example, an .exe might provide access to its common resources for its plugins by exporting some functions.
The plugins also provide exports for the .exe to call.
Export files however will be created even if linkage failed, so the .dll could link against the .exp file rather than the .lib file for successful linkage.
There should be no need for an (int) cast on that calculation, as the % expression will evaluate to an integer.
A returns a complex sympy Matrix as expected.
The exp (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on or after which the JWT MUST NOT be accepted for processing.
The processing of the exp claim requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the exp claim.
(When) should it expire/be invalidated?
A good pattern is to refresh the token before it expires.
Set the token expiration to one week and refresh the token every time the user open the web application and every one hour.
To refresh the token your api needs a new endpoint that receives a valid, not expired JWT and returns the same signed JWT with the new expiration field.
Just tested and yes "exp" expresses the expiration date of the Token, in seconds starting from epoch but it is not stated in the doc.
You're trying to use q with an expired licence.
Correctly (that is calculating (I + exp(scalar*(otherScalar*I-Matrix)))^{-1} ):
In the procedure case, (cadr exp) is not the name but a list whose first element is the name.
A .exp file is an export file -- basically just about the same as a .lib file.
The executable supplies some exported functions for use by plug-in DLLs, but also needs to be able to call some functions in the plug-ins as well (e.g.
To break the dependency, you run the linker against the executable, which fails (because it can't find a .lib file for the DLL), but will produce a .exp file.
You then link the DLL against the .exp file for the executable.
You should choose your exponent so that it is relatively prime to p-1 for all primes p which divide the modulus.
Here is a good answer to your question: [Should RSA public exponent be only in {3, 5, 17, 257 or 65537} due to security considerations?
compatibility to existing systems that only support specific public exponents
If those are valid concerns for you, you should consider lower exponents, but you should be aware that you become more sensitive to flaws in the RSA implementation.
I just tried to implement your example of exp(28000) using that example, but received a "Type Mismatch" error after processing a few loops.
Not surprising it will overflow given that Exp(28,000) is 1.8x1012160, the maximum value you can pass to Exp is ~709.
You only need to [run catexp/catalog (hyper-link)] if they haven't been run already for some reason; they would normally exist and be run as pat of the database creation, so you probably don't need to worry about those.
PARAMETER is a placeholder for any of [the supported parameters (hyper-link)], as shown under ['invoking export and import' (hyper-link)].
You need to specify an export (dump) file; the default is create a file called EXPDAT.DMP in the current directory.
There are [several export examples], including table mode and user mode.
In your case, it means that b is very small somewhere in your array, and you're getting a number (a/b or exp(log(a) - log(b))) that is too large for whatever dtype (float32, float64, etc) the array you're using to store the output is.
Isn't exp(log(a) - log(b)) the same as exp(log(a/b)) which is the same as a/b?
When you need to deal with exponential, you quickly go into under/over flow since the function grows so quickly.
A typical case is statistics, where summing exponentials of various amplitude is quite common.
Problems still arise because exp(-a) will still underflows up.
For example, exp(-1000) is already below the smallest number you can represent as a double.
gives -inf (log (0 + 0)), even though you can expect something like -1000 by hand (-1000 + log(2)).
The function logsumexp does it better, by extracting the max of the number set, and taking it out of the log:
Then exp(-10) will be not overflow!
The problem in this expression is that the np.exp() function takes one argument but you passed 2.
Try following alternatives (exp1 is faster, exp7 is more precise).

These implementations of exp() have been calculated by "scoofy" using Taylor series from a tanh() implementation of "fuzzpilz" (whoever they are, I just had these references on my code).
It does seem that it is probably not possible to substantially approve the accuracy of the exp computation without severely impacting the performance.
Schraudolph describes how the additive term in the tmp expression can be altered to achieve alternative approximation properties.
He also points out that at a "microscopic" level the approximate "exp" function exhibits stair-case behavior since 32 bits are discarded in the conversion from long to double.
A classic algorithm is being used in which the computation of exp() is mapped to computation of exp2().
After argument conversion via multiplication by log2(e), exponentation by the fractional part is handled using a minimax polynomial of degree 2, while exponentation by the integral part of the argument is performed by direct manipulation of the exponent part of the IEEE-754 single-precision number.
The volatile union facilitates re-interpretation of a bit pattern as either an integer or a single-precision floating-point number, needed for the exponent manipulation.
In case anyone wants to replicate the relative error function shown in the question, here's a way using Matlab (the "fast" exponent is not very fast in Matlab, but it is accurate):
Now, the period of the error exactly coincides with when the binary value of tmp overflows from the mantissa into the exponent.
Let's break our data into bins by discarding the bits that become the exponent (making it periodic), and keeping only the high eight remaining bits (to make our lookup table a reasonable size):
Linear interpolation between table entries would improve the error yet further, but at the expense of performance.
Taylor series approximations (such as the expX() functions in [Adriano's answer (hyper-link)]) are most accurate near zero and can have huge errors at -20 or even -5.
The trick is to recognize that exp() can be separated into integer and fractional parts.
The integer part has only 21 possible values for exp(-20) to exp(0), so these can be stored in a small look up table.
There are no lookbehind assertions in Javascript's implementation of regular expressions.
If you really need lookbehinds you could use a third-party regular expression library.
[JavaScript: Is there a regular expression library that fully supports lookarounds?
If I well understood I would use this regexp
The exp claim (and other time related claims like nbf) are numeric dates:
So you can indeed compare the long values like shown in your code,
or subtract the current time from the exp value to get the remaining time.
Why use indexOf instead of Regular Expression.
Regular expressions are best suited for deciding if patterns are matched.
This is the usecase where regular expression would prove beneficial.
According to the docs of [expo-cli (hyper-link)] and [exp-cli (hyper-link)], expo-cli includes not only cli but also XDE, and exp-cli only includes cli which is useful when you don't need a full-fledged development environment such as in CI.
"exp" is our original command-line interface.
"expo_cli" is our new dev tools that we see as the best path moving forward as it combines the best of both worlds from the exp CLI and our XDE gui.
You can read more about it here: [https://blog.expo.io/announcing-expo-dev-tools-beta-c252cbeccb36 (hyper-link)]
The latest [docs (hyper-link)] recommend using expo-cli, and not exp.
So, start with $ expo init instead of $ exp init.
But time in jwt token (iat, exp) is in seconds, therefore we have to divide result by 1000.
If jwt token expiration time is greater then actual time it means that it is still valid.
The processing of the exp claim requires that the current date/time MUST be before the expiration date/time listed in the exp claim.
Based on what Krzysztof Sztompka posted, I could get the Ext to show the correct expiry date.
This is the unencoded JWT which I will passed back to the users when they have signed in successfully and will allow me to check whether the JWT they have to pass as every future request is still valid and hasn't expired yet.
The epoch created by the library is Unix epoch time & you can check the jwt iat & exp values in any website ([like this for example (hyper-link)]) & you will find them valid
You exp was 1445717761 which is  GMT: Saturday, 24 October 2015 20:16:01
So the easiest way to create the iat (created automatically) & exp claims as per the documentation of the jsonwebtoken library [here (hyper-link)]
You can set the expiry easily this way
This will put the exp claim in the jwt as follows, with the correct unix epoch time for both iat & exp (with expiry 1 hour later than issued at time), so for example it will be like this (which can be verified easily in jwt libraries):
Note that the above expiresIn option is specific for jsonwebtoken library & a more generic way will be like this:
By adding *1000 to the exp and iat, you will see the right dates.
var d1 = new Date(decoded.exp*1000);
var d2 = new Date(decoded.iat*1000);
There are a number of platforms that don't take much care with their math library on which exp2(x) is simply implemented as exp(x * log(2)) or vice-versa.
Generating the exponent of the result is easier with exp2, but getting a high-accuracy significand can require slightly more work; the two factors roughly even out to the point that performance is usually equivalent within a factor of 10-15%.
Speaking very broadly, exp2 is usually the faster of the two.
Should exp2 be (theoretically) faster than exp?
The only way for x86 FPU to perform an exponentiation for non-integer power is using an instruction F2XM1 which calculates 2x-1.
Any C library code for x86 is forced to calculate both exp and exp2 using 2x.
Execution with:
for i in {1..100}; do ./empty.bin && ./exp2_p4.bin && ./exp_p4.bin && ./exp.bin && ./exp2.bin; done
where the file name tells whether the executable calls exp or exp2, and whether the summation is grouped by 4 (p4) or not.
I approximate the cost of the exponential by subtracting the time of the empty version (i.e.
do the loop and summation without calculating the exp) from the exponential ones.
exp2 can be around 11% faster than exp on Intel Xeon with gcc even if -ffast-math is on, in agreement with the accepted answer.
I will not attempt to rewrite your regular expression since we do not have the requirements, but the main issue here is your name group:
Meaning it will consume as much as it can including what you're expecting the rest of your expression to match, and it doesn't stop there.
This is just an example, naturally, the regular expression engine itself can do something similar with it's multiline modifier (m).
Continue to improve your regular expression pattern step by step.
With your input and your help I've modify my regexp to this :
exp(1e6) is e106.
The exp() function is not necessary to interpret floating point literals in C++, and in fact it does something else entirely.
The ^ operator doesn't do exponentiation.
The operator "**" is used to exponential.
In this case, instead of regexp you just need to use the wildcard :
It seems OP is trying to exclude /api and /resource for pageRouter by regular expression.
I got an answer from the expressjs's github,the link is [https://github.com/expressjs/express/issues/3404 (hyper-link)]
It is not just a matter of does the regular expression match the
  input, but since .use needs to strip down the matched path, it expects
  your match to stop before a / character to cut on.
Use a regular expression on the value of the text-box.
and approximate it by A1 + exp(A2-A1) (and the approximation will get better as A2-A1 is more negative).
Regardless, if y is too far from zero (either way) exp(y) will (over|under)flow a double and result in 0 or infinity (this is a double, right?
This explains your answers.
But since exp(A2-A1)=exp(-5000) is close to zero, your answer is approximately -40000+exp(-5000), which is indistinguishable from -40000, so that one is correct.
in such huge exponent differences the safest you can do without arbitrary precision is
chose the biggest exponent let it be Am = max(A1,A2)
so: log(exp(A1)+exp(A2)) -> log(exp(Am)) = Am
If you want to use the second formula then all breaks down to computing log(1+exp(A))
your exponent difference is base^500
if you have quadruple precision that should be enough but when you start changing the exp difference again yo will quickly get to the same point as now
The difference between the forms is that on the older form I am using 2 drop-down fields (SELECT tags) for expiry month and year in MM and YYYY formats.

RFC 7519 states that the [exp (hyper-link)] and [iat (hyper-link)] claim values must be NumericDate values.
Maybe exp is writing to standard error output rather than standard output.
Use the Data Pump import and export tools, unless you have very specific reasons not to (and with Oracle 11g, I can't think of a reason).
impdp and expdp have an option for doing exactly what you want: [partition_options (hyper-link)].
Set that to merge and partitioned tables will be transformed into non-partitioned ones (during import or export).
You may want to look-up the Oracle Database Utilities Guide on more options on how-to use expdp/impdp.

Many formulas may suit your needs, depending on how fast you want the required exp to go up.
Here's one formula: First level-up happens at 50 exp; second at 150exp; third at 300 exp; fourth at 500 exp; etc.
In other words, first you have to gather 50 exp, then 100 exp, then 150exp, etc.
For levelup X then you need 25*X*(1+X) exp.
So, for example, if we have 300 exp, we see that:
I take it what you're looking for is the amount of experience to decide what level they are on?
Such as:
Level 1: 50exp
Level 2: 100exp
Level 3: 150exp ?
It really depends on how you want the exp to scale for each level.
An equation relating experience (X) with level (L) is:
To calculate the level for a given experience use the quadratic equation to get:
Where L is the level, and X is the experience points

Apparently this can happen when expo caches a corrupt starter file (see [Issues (hyper-link)]).
Try to delete the file at ~\.exponent\starter-app-cache\blank-1.8.0.tar.gz and/or remove and reinstall exp using npm remove -g exp and npm install -g exp
This is because blank-31.0.1.tar.gz expo pakage does not downloaded properly.
go to C:\Users\YourUsername\ .expo\starter-app-cache     and delete  "blank-31.0.1.tar.gz".
You could also navigate to %userprofile%/.expo/starter-app-cache folder to delete blank-1.8.0.tar.gz, and run the expo init again
The argument in the exp function is the power.
exp(-x) can be read as "e to the power of negative x"
It seems exp doesn't installed correctly.
npm uninstall -g exp (Remove corrupted package if so)
npm i -g exp (And reinstall again exp package)
Maybe, you can install expo-cli.
I was using prrocess.waitFor() command to wait the process ..this was causing exp process to wait ..After commenting this export is working fine now...

Your equat1 is a SymPy expression (of class exp, since its outermost layer is exp function), and this is not callable.
One can use [lambdify (hyper-link)] to make a callable out of a SymPy expression:
brenth expects a real valued function.
Generally, one cannot expect both real and imaginary part to vanish at the same point, anyway.
Lastly, the function exp never turns to zero, so what do you really expect to obtain?
Answer to this question is well documented in [expo documentation (hyper-link)]
This may sound familiar to you because Expo does
  this as well -- when you create a project with XDE or exp you don't
  have to deal with Xcode or Android Studio configuration files, it just
  works.
This guide is intended to outline some of the key differences
  between Expo and CRNA (create-react-native-app).
CRNA does not require you to have an Expo account
So what does not
  having an account mean, and what would signing up and using XDE/exp
  get you -- why do we require it with Expo?
Having an Expo account
  allows you to do the following:
Publish your project to a permanent URL, eg:https://expo.io/@community/reactconf2017.See Publishing on Expo for more information.
To do this with CRNA without using Expo,
  you would need to run eject.
Expo advantages:
Expo can build .apk and .ipa files
Expo disadvantages:
Your final app will bigger with expo init than with react native app init.
I suggest you read this:
[https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/why-not-expo (hyper-link)]
create-react-native-app was replaced by expo-cli.

Sprout is header-only library that provide C++11/14 constexpr based Containers, Algorithms, Random numbers, Parsing, Ray tracing, Synthesizer, and others.
Your code should work but any way a workaround is to compute the exponential yourself from the Jordan form:
Generally, the best way to implement ex is by calling the exp function provided by your computing platform.
Failing this, implementing the exp function is complicated and requires several esoteric skills.
Moving the integer part of y into the exponent field of a floating-point encoding.
Evaluating the exponential of the fractional part of y with a [minimax polynomial (hyper-link)].
I wrote a tool that, among other things, allows evaluation of the exponential to high (user specified) precision.
The exponential series is itself especially interesting.
I describe the methods I employed for the exponential in section 4.1 of the file HPFMod2.pdf, which is included with [HPF (hyper-link)].
As an example, to compute exp(123.456789), one might try to use a series directly, but better is to store the value of e itself.
We get the exponentials of powers of 2 by repeated squaring, then the fractional part will converge moderately rapidly.
Now, we could write the desired exponential as:
The exp/html library was incomplete which is why it was removed for Go1.
When you do the hg update step though, note that since the exp tree is not tagged go1, that hg update release won't get it for you.
A better strategy is hg update tip, then copy the exp directory or directories of interest somewhere and recompile it with whatever Go version you are using, Go 1.0.1, for example.
[https://code.google.com/p/go-wiki/wiki/InstallingExp (hyper-link)]
I limited it to only the package I was interested in: go install exp/html (if I recall, correctly).
The exp packages have been moved to different repositories now, to make them easier to install.
Now you can install the former exp/html with go get "golang.org/x/net/html".
Note: with go 1.4 (Q4, 2014), [the url for that exp package will change (again) (hyper-link)]:
If you look at the IEEE 754 binary format for a double it is: 53 significant binary bits / 15.95 significant decimal digits plus 11 exponent bits.
Not always, for example %.20f might be perfectly accurate if the exponent of the number is -4.
You can use the following XPath expression to get all <font> tags (assuming your HTML document is well formed):
In PHP there are many ways to run XPath expressions on documents, for example [this one (hyper-link)].
It supports JQuery-like selectors, so you'd find your element using this expression:
I must warn you against using Jens' solution, as trying to parse HTML with regular expressions is a journey into the dark abyss of pure malevolent madness.
By its very nature, regular expressions cannot deal with that kind of recursion.
While you might be able to create an expression that looks like it works, there will most certainly be valid cases that slip through or cases that should not match that do.
You should use exp version 11.2.0.4.0(the same as the server has), although in this case it more looks like a bug in Oracle's exp utility.
Computers don't really do exponents.
look at alternate formulations of exp(x) that are lower accuracy but higher speed
Now I have to ask myself why would you be living in so many iterations of exp(A*x)*x and I think you might be switching back and forth between frequency/wavenumber domain and time/space domain.
You also might be dealing with probabilities using exp(x) as a basis, and doing some Bayesian fun.
I don't know that exp(x) is a good conjugate prior, so I'm going to go with the fourier material.
Now, if it were me, I would want to get "A" out of the exponent.
f(x)  = B2 * exp( B1 * x )
and change expiresIn to expiresInMinutes
You have member_data disabled in your exp: tag so if that is related to the custom member fields they won't resolve.
You are very likely experiencing this bug: [http://expressionengine.com/bug_tracker/bug/18239 (hyper-link)]
Are you using ExpressionEngine 2.5.3?
There are lots of functions for manipulating an expression like this.
The simplest way to simplify is to either rewrite exp as sin or rewrite sin as exp:
Using regular expressions with Matcher:
[code snippet]
Watch your value of -w when it is passed to the [numpy.exp (hyper-link)] function in that code.
If it evaluates to a large enough positive number, calling the [exponential function (hyper-link)] on that would seem like it could easily cause an overflow.
You use expm1(x) for anything close to 0.
The reason is because exp(x) of anything close to 0 will be very close to 1.
Therefore exp(x) - 1 will suffer from destructive cancellation when x is close to 0.
expm1(x) is properly optimized to avoid this destructive cancellation.
From the mathematical side: If exp is implemented using its Taylor Series, then expm1(x) can be done by simply omitting the first +1.
That's why expm1 can give you much more accuracy for near-zero powers than exp can, because double doesn't have enough precision to store very accurate numbers very close to 1.
I don't believe the article you're citing is correct, as far as the accuracy of Math.exp goes (modulo the limitations of double).
The Math.exp specification guarantees that the result is within 1 ulp of the exact value, which means -- to oversimplify a bit -- a relative error of at most 2^-52, ish.
(x ^ 0.6)) ==  exp(x * 0.6))
You are using the wrong function (expm1 is the correct one).
AVC uses Exp-Golomb coding in it's various headers, all compatible encoders have to as well.
Also, te(v) stands for Truncated Exponential-golomb encoding.
Anyway, you can find information about reading signed Exponential-Golomb codes on the [wiki page: (hyper-link)]
That's not at all accurate, you're supposed to add 1 during encoding, and subtract 1 during decoding (for unsigned Exp-Golomb only), Signed Exp-Golomb uses a completely different system.
Mapped Exp-Golomb is exactly the same as Unsigned Exp-Golomb, plus a table lookup.
Truncated Exp-Golomb is the same as standard RICE aka Unary coding, except the stop bit is 0.
If you don't feel like creating your own decoders/encoders, take a look at my project BitIO, because I've already written them, especially ReadRICE/WriteRICE, and ReadExpGolomb/WriteExpGolomb functions, [BitIO on Github (hyper-link)]
And I've solved it closing Visual Studio (then pressing the Restart button from Expo XDE)
It is possible that the torch exp and sin previously support LongTensor but not anymore (not very sure about it).

Try using expdp which invokes an export using the Oracle Data Pump utility.
Also, be sure that your schema has the EXP_FULL_DATABASE role.
I would try doing the expdp (with the appropriate parameters) from the command-line first to make sure it works.
Then insert the expdp command-line into your script.
This method can be seen within [Chapter 7 of the Oracle Docs (hyper-link)], more specifically, 7.3.3.2 Exporting the Full Oracle Database.
Expanded
The Exp, Log, etc.
If you just want to calculate the log and exp of a value it is usually better to use FastMath which provides static method for this and other basic mathematical functions (similar to Math but providing a pure java implementation and being faster for some of them).
You will need to use a different datatype that will most likely not be compatible with exp(.).
Putting a number that large into exp will return infinity.
Explanation:
{0,253} - Matches between 0 and 253 of the previous expression
To see if a string matches a regular expression, we can use the test method.
You really should be showing 4.851652e8, which is the correct value for exp(20) with the given level of precision.
Replace react-native with expo (exp).
Open up ~/.bash_profile then add the following line to the bottom: export PATH=$PATH:~/.npm-global/bin
exp was [replaced (hyper-link)] with expo
To install Expo CLI, just run npm install -g expo-cli (or yarn global add expo-cli, whichever you prefer).
I also had a hard time getting expo command to work on Mac.
After confirming expo is in there, edit ~/.bash_profile and add the line:
Now the expo command should function as intended.
You should try npx expo init <your_app_name> to test.
Find the path where expo is globally installed by npm:
It turns out the command to install expo
 npm install -g expo-cli was referencing an older version of node on my machine; when checked using npm root -g.
Then reinstalled node and ran npm install -g expo-cli again.
sudo npm install --unsafe-perm -g expo-cli
try sudo npm install --global expo-cli
this worked for me.
exp(1) equals [e (hyper-link)] where e is [Euler's number (hyper-link)].
e^x is same as [expm(x) (hyper-link)] and e.^(x) is same as [exp(x) (hyper-link)].
e^x and expm(m) represent e raise to the matrix x.
e.^(x) and exp(x) represent exponential ex for each element in matrix x.
If x is a scalar then all (e^x, expm(x), e.^x and exp(x)) are mathematically equal.
[exp(x) (hyper-link)] and [expm(x) (hyper-link)] have same definitions in MATLAB as those that are described for Octave above.
In Octave, it is important to note that e^x and exp(x), where x is a double precision scalar variable, are not necessarily the same.
The reason is that exp (2) uses a dedicated algorithm to compute the exponential function, while e ^ 2 actually calls the function e () to get the value of e, and then squares it:
Another reason why e ^ x and exp (x) differ is that they compute completely different things when x is a square matrix, but this has already been discussed in Sardar's answer.
exp(x) cannot become less than 0.
So I cannot explain the division by 0 in TBack_Prop.g.
.exp file contains the list of exported symbols only.
[.exp is used on Windows only (hyper-link)] and is of no use on Ubuntu.
The log-link is employed by exponentiating the lambda.
mu = exp(lambda)
Regular expression search will return groups surrounded by round brackets.
Also, you have a non-critical error in your regular expression.
So the resulting expression should look like this:
Visual Studio's linker has an [/IMPLIB (hyper-link)] option that allows you to specify the output location for your .lib and .exp files.
The linker will create the .exp file using the same name as the .lib.
There some functions inside COM library declared with as __declspec(dllexport).
It means that they are exported (may be used by GetProcAdress function) and linker thinks that there is a need to link with this dynamic library (no matter it is exe or dll - in general the structure is the same) and creates *.lib and *.exp file.
to avoid creation of these files you need to remove all __declspec(dllexport) from functions declarations
The short answer is, I could set the iss and exp to any value I want: there wasn't any way to verify this on that server's end.
The only reason to not set it so a token never expires by using a ridiculous exp value would be for security reasons.
E.g., [an algebraic identity (hyper-link)] can be used to transform  the original exp.
But essentially a is an expression-object, in order to evaluate it you have to call something like evalf on it.
It'd probably be better to compute exp(x)-1, which is as simple as
In the same thread,  [@kmario23 (hyper-link)] points out an important caveat about promoting .data to floats (inputs could be int or smth) so it is compatible with the .exp() or whatever function, I would want to do that if I was writing smth for general use.
My apologies for not explaining what I changed, but this was really difficult for me to figure out.
You are likely not linking the library that includes the exp() function.
I believe exp() is included in 'libm', so adding -Wl,-lm (or however else you specify libm in your build system) should fix it.
In particular it is not related to the base of the natural logarithm, and it is not equal to exp(1).
As for your followup comment, ln(exp(x)) is not equal to x for all complex values of x, which is why Maple does not simplify the former to the latter.
Look at the help page for topic ln, which explains in the second paragraph of its description,
And, plotting part of that last expression,
UPDATE:
TOAD version 9.7.2 will read a "dmp" file generated by EXP.
Select DATABASE -> EXPORT -> EXPORT FILE BROWSER from the menus.
NOTE: The only other known utility that will a dmp file generated by the exp utility is the imputility.
The regular expression in the question misses a lot of edge cases.
See the Jeff Atwood's blog post [The Problem With URLs (hyper-link)] for an explanation of some of the other issues.
Add a "g" to the end of the regular expression to enable global matching:
But that only fixes the problem in the question where the regular expression was only replacing the first match.
First off, rolling your own regexp to parse URLs is a terrible idea.
If you insist on a regular expression, the most comprehensive is the [URL regexp from Component (hyper-link)], though it will falsely detect some non-existent two-letter TLDs by looking at it.
Just think of the string 'a+b*c' with the naive grammar for expressions 'E:=E+E|E*E|...'.
imp system/data file=c:\tmp\dbbackup.exp show=y
When there's is no expiration time defined, the token won't expire.
It isn't exp(I*pi) it is polar_exp(I*pi).
If you print(expr) you will see this:
Replacing with .subs(exp_polar(I*pi), -1) will work...but you should read up about polar_lift and exp_polar to understand what it is telling you and what you should be aware of when making that replacement.
In this answer, I address the variation between systems, not the round-trip of exp(log(x)).
As indicated in your other question, the round-trip result is generally not equal to the input, even with the best possible implementations of exp and log.
crlibm-1.0beta3.pdf provides correctly-rounded implementations of log and exp, with proofs.
As remarked in [this post (hyper-link)], np.exp quickly reaches overflow.
Explanation:
Secondly, the problem you're seeing is that glm is placing the coefficient in front of the whole term: y ~ coef * exp(x) instead of inside: y ~ exp(coef * x) like you want.
This works because it's like taking the equation you want to fit, y = exp(coef * x), and taking the log of both sides, so you're now fitting log(y) = coef * x, which is equivalent to what you want to fit and works with the GLM paradigm.
The conflicts all come from the ambuguity of the exp: exp binop exp rule -- an input like a+b*c with two binops can be parsed as either (a+b)*c or a+(b*c).
You've done that for the tokens, but haven't done it for the rule exp: exp binop exp.
Now each token has its own version of the rule, and each rule automatically gets its precedence from the single token in it, so you don't even need to explicitly set the precedence of the rules, yacc does it for you.
You can use the relation (exp(x) - 1)-1 = 1/(exp(x)-1) = exp(-x)/(1 - exp(-x)), to rewrite a = lambda x: (x**(5/3))*np.exp(-x) / (np.exp(-x)-1) and this gives you zero.
I'm not shure what is the .exp file but [The Qt Resource System (hyper-link)] allow you storing files with any extension in the application's executable.
Your expression
To use expressions, you can either use unquote (note the preceding comma)
loss = tf.minimum(tf.exp(n), MAX_VALUE)
Exponential terms in loss functions are usually handled in machine learning by minimising not the exponential itself, but its logarithm.
Both functions are monotonically crescent, so minimising the logarithm brings you to the same minimum than minimising the exponential.
After searching the 'Exp' string under my package project sub folders.
MyExp is the name of my new Hive.
evalNode return a list of (string*exp) but is a exp
This is your error: a list of string * exp is not an exp; the compiler cannot guess that you meant to apply the constructor List to build an exp from this list (if the right definition of List happens to be List of (string * exp) list).
Any expression in Ocaml has to return a single type.
So, for example, you can't write something like if a>b then "a" else 7 because it doesn't know whether the type of that expression is string or int.
When e is an EInt the first matching option is triggered and it returns e which has type exp.
When e is an Etree(Node(s,i,t1,t2)) the second matching option in the second match statement is triggered, returning evalnode(tree) which we know from what you've written to have type (string * exp) list.
But combining the outer match is problematic since the first case returns an exp and the second case returns a (string * exp) list so it doesn't know what type the expression should have.
I'm not sure why the error says (string * 'a) list rather than (string * exp) list but I suspect you can fix things without having to work that out.
I do also want to note that you have a constructor List of (string*exp) whose subtype is not a list.
You may wish this to be List of (string*exp) list and then to have your inner match return List([]) and List(evalNode(tree)) but that's just a guess.
Apologies for the waffly explanation.
Some background for others: when you're computing an expression of the following type directly
exp(x_i) can overflow (x_i is too big), resulting in numbers that you can't add together
exp(x_i) can underflow (x_i is too small), resulting in a bunch of zeroes
If all the values are big, or all are small, we can divide by some exp(const) and add const to the outside of the ln to get the same value.
The  expression
In fact, in general, ln( exp(x_1) + exp(x_2) + ... ) will give be very close to max(x_i) if some particular x_i is much bigger than all the others.
So there's no reason to waste time computing the expression for the smaller values recursively if they will be lost in your final result anyway.
If you wanted to be really persnickety about implementing this, you'd divide by exp(max(x_i) - some_constant) or so to 'center' the resulting values around 1 to avoid both overflow and underflow, and that might give you a few extra digits of precision in the result.
I assume you mean *= 1.25 there, to increase the amount of experience needed for the next level exponentially :).
level one requires 30 exp total now;
level two requires 7.5 additional exp; total of 37.5
level three requires 1.125 exp; total of 38.625
etc.
When using *= 1.25; the amount of exp needed to reach the next level actually increases:
30 -> 37.5 -> 46.875 -> 58.594 -> etc
The loop won't exit until $level is as great as (or equal) to $exp, which will never happen once $level2 becomes 0.
If I understand you correctly, you are saying that you can buy 50 HP for (currentHP * 500) EXP, or:
This basically simulates the continual purchase of HP until you don't have enough EXP anymore:
I ran the exp function with the exact same values and it outputs the right result:
The function exp means e**(-var1-var2-var3)
And the standard for [JWT (hyper-link)] says nothing against empty exp claim:
The "exp" (expiration time) claim identifies the expiration time on

math.exp(myDecimal.toDouble)
with some loss of precision due to double encoding.
I would expect the difference to be more significant for larger x though.
The problem is that it works at reg exp online tools but not when I try to use it in grep.
It looks like your online tools are not using [POSIX regular expressions (hyper-link)] as grep.

Set -P (:--perl-regexp) to be able to use it:
I can think of one, namely when y is close to zero, which is a problem with division, not the exp function.
Googling: "c++ exp" returned this as the first result [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/exp/ (hyper-link)]

In the middle of the page, there is EXACTLY what you're looking for.
Using your knowledge of logarithms and exponents, you should be able to identify potential overflows using properties like INT_MAX: examine these [C++ Limitations (hyper-link)]
To expand the answer of @TheOtherGuy, you can cancel the operation if overflow occurs.
For the exp() handling:
You can do this before calculating an exp().
Because log() is inverse of exp() .
to be able to export view.
[LOG() (hyper-link)] and [EXP() (hyper-link)] implicitly convert arguments to the [float (hyper-link)] data type, which are approximate values.
In pure T-SQL LOG and EXP operate with the float type (8 bytes), which has only [15-17 significant digits (hyper-link)].
To demonstrate the problem I'll change the type in your example to numeric(15,0) and use POWER instead of EXP:
Calculating LOG looses precision, SUM looses precision, EXP/POWER looses precision.
And you wouldn't need the trick with LOG/EXP.
But, running product using OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...) doesn't work (checked with SQL Server 2014 Express 12.0.2000.8):
Find a third-party .NET math library that offers Log and Exp functions with high precision.
And then use the EXP + LOG + SUM() Over (Order by) approach, where SUM is the built-in T-SQL function, which supports Over (Order by) and Exp and Log are custom CLR functions that return not float, but high-precision decimal.
Exp is defined for all real values, while log isn't.
exp does not have this problem.
You may never expect a negative number but simply get it through a truncation error or coming very close to floating point representations (a value so small it ends up being represented as a small negative number).
These tables are often generated at runtime and basically offer a faster execution time at the expense of the memory allocated to store it.
The table holds the values of exp for arguments in the range -6 to 6.
The following code in the same source file word2vec.c uses this table to calculate exponents:
(So if you wonder what value there is at the first cell of the table - it's exp(-6))
this this piece of code calculate a logistic function table in range [-6, 6) and the step size is 1 / EXP_TABLE_SIZE * 2 = 0.002.
I will explain in detail.
if x in range [0, 1) then x * 2 - 1 will in range [-1, 1) and (x * 2 - 1) * MAX_EXP will in range [-MAX_EXP, MAX_EXP).
Replace the x with i / EXP_TABLE_SIZE, you get the first line in the code.
So, the first line calculate EXP(x), x in range [-6, 6), and the step size is  1 / EXP_TABLE_SIZE * 2.
the second line, EXP(X) / (EXP(X) + 1) is a logistic function.
f + MAX_EXP is in range (0, 12), (f + MAX_EXP) / MAX_EXP / 2 is in range (0, 1).
The multiply this value with EXP_TABLE_SIZE you get the index according to the f value.
What is an ExpTable used for?
[Writing exponential functions from tables (hyper-link)]
It might be worth going through the excellent [Kahn Academy Series (hyper-link)] on exp if you are not already familiar with theie uses.
The 'exp' function is applied to Vectors (v"sub wo Transpose) multiplied by (v sub wI)
A fantastic blog can be read here for further information: [Word2Vec Implementations of Gradient and expTable (hyper-link)]
You cannot use the export utility on other schemas without privileges - it's a security issue.
If you do not have the system privileges contained in the
  EXP_FULL_DATABASE role, then you cannot export objects contained in
  another user's schema.
For example, you cannot export a table in
  another user's schema, even if you created a synonym for it.
Note also that the use of exp is desupported starting with 11g.
It is preferred to use expdp.
A possible workaround is to export the USER_CHORUS's schema by invoking exp as that user.
The code below forces the expression to be converted to boolean.
produces the expected output:
As others have noted, "exp" is replaced by "expdp".
In terms of getting a schema level datapump export to work, you need the following:
assuming "ARI" is the user that you will be connecting to when running your export.
2) A datapump command is then very similar to the old 'exp' command.
Although i added a "match group", so check the match/search result returned by the RegExp so the right parameters are re-inserted in the right place.
RegExp explanation:
You don't want to use a regular expression for this.
The simple explanation for that is that you just forgot to export anything.
The linker won't create a .lib/.exp file if there are no exports.
You can verify this by running dumpbin.exe /exports on the DLL.
With the expectation that you see nothing.
Use __declspec(dllexport) to export symbols from the DLL.
Since this move was planned before I wrote the first line of code, they weren't marked for export, and were, hence, using that project's default calling convention, __cdecl.
With the calling convention specified, both in the header and the CPP files that hold the implementations, I got the expected .LIB file.
First, if you're using 10g or later, you can consider using data pump (expdp and impdp) as opposed to imp and exp.
If you are using impdp/expdp - Datapump (10g or later) - , you can simply use DBMS_DATAPUMP:
If 6 significant decimal digits are enough for you, exp(x)-1 is okay up to x being 1e-10.
Why not always use expm1?
Because expm1(x) + 1 has absolutely no benefit over exp(x), no matter how small x is.
It only makes sense to use expm1 when your computation actually requires something like exp(x) - 1.
It's not really about how small x is, but about how exp(x) is used in your computation.
The purpose of expm1 should be understood in wider context of [Loss of significance (hyper-link)].
Wikipedia explains this well on the example of quadratic equation.
If your goal is to compute exp(x), or 3*exp(x) + 4 or such, you should use exp.
There is no loss of significance here, and no benefit of putting expm1 in such a formula, regardless of how small x is.
Writing expm1(x) + 1 instead of exp(x) is entirely pointless.
If your formula is exp(x) - 1 or exp(x) - cos(x), then there is potential loss of significance for small x.
In this context, the formula exp(x) - 1 incurs unacceptable loss of precision when x is smaller than 1e-10.
Indeed, the value of exp(x) - 1 is close to x but exp(x) looks like 1.00000000... with 10 digits after dot being 0; so only 6 digits remain from x itself.
Rewriting np.exp(x) - np.cos(x) as np.expmp(x) - np.cos(x) + 1 would have no benefit at all; one has to think through the entire computation to eliminate the subtraction of nearly-equal numbers.
In this case, write a separate exp_taylor() function, rather than just writing it inline.
Also note that you are expanding about x=0 and can expect significant error for x far from 0.
The Exp suffix isn't special, it's just part of the variable name (it's an abbreviation of expression).
The remaining arguments are related to the expressions.
Your template has 3 string chunks separated by expressions (an expression is ${} with something inside of it), and those chunks are "That ", " is a ", and "."
There are two expressions, person and age, so they would be put into the subsequent arguments: the second argument would have the value of person, and the third would have to value of age.
In Perl and PCRE, you can refer to a subexpression by using (?1).
Since you're working with DNA, if you have a chance, I'd suggest working in a life-embracing language such as Python (JS has poor regex abilities, though the XregeExp library fills some holes.)
The problem with your expression is that back references match whatever was matched by a previous memory capture; the expression that generated the memory capture itself can't be referenced in this manner.
That said, you can still shorten the expression by using a multiplier on your expression:
The expression matches the same thing twice, with an optional set of spaces in between.
which is probably what you were expecting in the first place.
To answer the .exp file question: it's basically similar to the .lib file in that it specifies which symbols are exported from a .dll.
You can more directly just use [sympy.polys.polytools.cancel() (hyper-link)], which is available as a method on your expression with .cancel().
This is what is doing the work of simplifying your expression inside simplify().
Edit: This isn't a stable solution, and I would advise that you take a look at [asmeurer's answer (hyper-link)] where he suggests using [expand() (hyper-link)].
The exact function you want to use depends on the general form of the expressions you are dealing with.
I think it is only working here because it represents the expression in terms of exp(-x).
If it instead used exp(x), it wouldn't simplify, because (x + 1)/x doesn't have any common factors.
For this expression, I would use expand() (or the more targeted expand_mul).
expand will distribute the denominator over the numerator, i.e., (exp(x) + 1)/exp(x) will become exp(x)/exp(x) + 1/exp(x).
SymPy then automatically cancels exp(x)/exp(x) into 1 and converts 1/exp(x) into exp(-x) (they are internally both represented the same way).
If you have applets in your CAP file, your exports will not contain public classes (Specification of Javacard Virtual Machine, version 3.0.1, section 6.12 "Export Component" - last paragraph.)
X_{n+1} = X_{n} - (exp(X_{n}) - X) / (exp(X_{n})
No regexps either.
To sum it up: Newlines are matched and the expression is caseless.
Depending on what you mean with "to simulate Ke^(-θs)/(*s + 1)", you may try or use

What scribble/text does, is it starts reading the file in "text" mode, whereas at-exp starts reading the file in "racket" mode.
To do the same thing as scribble/text, you would need a version of at-exp that starts in text mode.
Are you sure you want to optimize on that exp value and not log(exp(f)) == f. ?
[exp(-x)+exp(-y)+x*y (hyper-link)]
Depending on your specific needs, it may be useful to crop the input argument to exp().
scipy.special.expit(x).
Additionally you could modify your method to print out the new values and verify they are as expected.
I would have expected code like
it seems to me that around exp(-745) the value is the smallest that a float can hold.
Also, check this [Exponential of large negative numbers (hyper-link)]
This is a common problem with exp and log functions, as the output tends to disappear to zero rather quickly.
A good observation is that you typically want expr(x) - 1 in most scientific computations, and most implementations provide a custom function for that to avoid numerical stability issues.
So, if it fits your use case, you should definitely consider expm1.
Similar considerations also apply to log, and hence we have log1p, expm1, log1pexp, log1mexp etc.
See here for details: [https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.expm1.html (hyper-link)]
You may need to write your own version of exp().
* in the middle of the first expression:
You can furthermore make the view function the show function for Exp:
np.exp(...)
'float' object has no attribute 'exp'
The calculation of expl() may well be your bottleneck, but a single evaluation of expl() is still going to consume a very small number of clock cycles.
You also don't need to call the RegExp constructor since you have a literal.
where exp(-x) appears because it is the reciprocal of the derivative of the map x->exp(x).
Or, equivalently, it's the derivative of the inverse map (log y)' = 1/y, but expressed in terms of the x variable.
Short explanation is "chain rule from Calculus 1".
I think the easiest way to understand what exp(O(n)) means is to demonstrate the difference:
If we assume we are working in base e, then exp(O(n)) can be written as ef(n), where f(n) ∈ O(n).
Notice that both n and 2n are O(n), however, when they are in the exponent, things are different: O(en) ≠ O(e2n), because O(e2n) = O((e2)n).
The exponential expression has a different base, therefore belonging to a different class of functions.
Thus, exp(O(n)) is a different class of functions than O(exp(n)), as the latter requires that the asymptotic growth follows that of en.
An important result is that exp(O(n)) includes functions that grow faster than any function in O(exp(n)), and thus O(exp(n)) ⊆ exp(O(n)).
What might be the source of the confusion is that exp(O(n)) is actually the same class as O(exp(O(n))).
However, as exp(O(n)) is already a class of functions, there is no need to add the wrapping O.
Because c·exp(f(n)) grows slower than exp(c·f(n)), thus c·exp(f(n)) ∈ exp(O(n)) for f(n) ∈ O(n).
Actually, the .exp extension is a reserved extension for exports files.
If you set the "BasedOn" key to, e.g., image, a .exp file will be treated as image.
[Yes, you can use imp/exp to achieve that (hyper-link)].
And when you are on Oracle10, use Oracle's new [Data Pump (hyper-link)] utilities instead of imp/exp.
You can for sure use the exp tool to export your database and then use the imp tool to import it to the new database.
Can one import/export between different versions of Oracle?
This
  means that one can take an export file
  created from an old export version,
  and import it using a later version of
  the import utility.
Oracle also ships some previous
  catexpX.sql scripts that can be
  executed as user SYS enabling older
  imp/exp versions to work (for
  backwards compatibility).
For example,
  one can run
  $ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/admin/catexp7.sql
  on an Oracle 8 database to allow the
  Oracle 7.3 exp/imp utilities to run
  against an Oracle 8 database.
For more information on this matter, take a look at [Import Export FAQ (hyper-link)].
While you can use exp/imp to "upgrade" from an older version, i wouldn't do it!
By using exp/imp you are effectively creating a new database.
Also be aware, that the import can take much much longer than the export did.
numpy.exp(n) overflows for some value in the range 700-800.
My runtime erros was the following:
RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in exp
  expElogthetad = np.exp(Elogthetad)
After trying so many times and things, I came across with a reading recommending uninstalling numpy and reinstalling it back again:
The answer is here at the bottom:

I think following solution will work for validating credit card expiry date.
It allows m/yy or m/yyyy format for expiry date.
So no delimiters if you are using new RegExp and new RegExp also needs double escaping.

exp takes double parameter and returns double.
1.+exp(-1.
note that you have different exp functions depending on the float type (expf, exp, expl)
SO to print float value I decided to do away with doing like (int)(1./(1.+exp(-1.
The 21599(seconds) just tells you the token will expire in 6h, doesn't give you the actual date.
Since every XSD content model can in fact be translated into a regular expression over QNames, and one might want to exhibit this XSD for documentation purposes or for purposes of reasoning about the complex type more conveniently, this question is not quite as quixotic or off-base as some respondents appear inclined to suspect.
And like your samples, it takes the name for the named regular expression either from the complex type being translated or from the enclosing element declaration, which means it will run into trouble if the schema has types and elements with the same local name.
After each expression (whether element or group), emit an occurrence indicator:  *, +, ?, empty string, or a count operator like {4}, {2,}, or {0,4}.
Between any two sibling expressions (i.e.
after each expression that has a right sibling), emit an appropriate connector:  comma, ampersand, or or-bar.
According to the lecturer, this should speed the calculation up, because the calculation of the e-function (exp, natural exponential function) is computationally expensive.
The exp is not a very significant issue.
The Gaussian computation is expensive for other reasons: there are several thousand Gaussian scored every frame each with a few dozen components each of 40 floats.
It is expensive to process all this data due to the amount of memory you need to feed and store.
Exp time: 1.5752s (3174296.9903 per second)

Instead of completely evaluating the power and the factorial terms for each term in your expansion, you should consider how the k'th term is related to the k-1'th term and just update each term based on this relationship.
You don't have anything setting the expbar's max or current value when you load.
To do this, however, you'll need a reference to the instance of expScript:
And then in the inspector, drag the gameobject that has the expScript component attached to it into the expScriptInstance field of GlobalGameMechanics.

If the <EnableGatewayTokenCache> or <EnableKeyManagerTokenCache> elements are enabled in the <APIM_HOME>/repository/conf/api-manager.xml file, the expiry time of the JWT is the same as the cache expiry time by default.

If so, it's setting it to a list containing one "option" string, which appears to be a regular expression.
The documentation I've found on optparse doesn't give much information on what it expects you to provide to options.plugins.
However, generally speaking, the answer to this sort of question of "why do I assign X to Y" when working with an external library is simply that that's the input you're expected to provide when working with that particular library.
Exponential decay problems seem to be especially challenging for the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (and the implementations used by curve_fit(), and do require reasonable starting points.
If possible, if your problem involves exponential decay, it is helpful to work in log space.
For your problem in particular, your model function is exp(-a*x)**b.
There is a parameter expr (which expects an expression).
Thus, exp is matched to the expr parameter.
Including in the surrounding code that uses exp)
[Fastest Implementation of Exponential Function Using AVX (hyper-link)] and [Fastest Implementation of Exponential Function Using SSE (hyper-link)] have versions with other speed / precision tradeoffs, for _ps (packed single-precision float).
[Fast SSE low precision exponential using double precision operations (hyper-link)] is at the other end of the spectrum, but still for double.
[How many clock cycles does cost AVX/SSE exponentiation on modern x86_64 CPU?
+-Inf is represented by a bit-pattern of significand=0, exponent=all-ones.
I think we need to do a regular blend, or something as expensive (3 uops and a vector constant).
I wrote ANDPD just so I didn't have to explain this in comments.
(mask off the sign bit of initial_x and do _mm_cmplt_pd(abs_initial_x, _mm_set1_pd(details::EXP_LIMIT))).
Cheaply checking abs(initial_x) > details::EXP_LIMIT
If the exp algorithm was already squaring initial_x, you could compare against EXP_LIMIT squared.
If you square your input and subtract, it only costs one FMA to do initial_x * initial_x - details::EXP_LIMIT * details::EXP_LIMIT to create a result that's negative for abs(initial_x) < details::EXP_LIMIT, and non-negative otherwise.
You can list tables you want to export or import in your command line as 'tables=...'
Or run exp/imp interactively and it will ask you for list of tables.
I assume you want to generate random number with CDF; F(x) = exp(-x/lambda), for valid support of x such that 0 <= F(x) <= 1.
Set u1 = exp(-x/lambda) => x = -lambda*log(u1)
Note: 
If exp(-x/lambda) is the PDF and not the CDF, you can find the CDF by integrating the PDF and do the same steps above, with a change in step 2, depending on what the CDF is.
I don't know if Exp-Golomb codes is exactly the same.

The EXP-00091 Exporting questionable statistics error happens when you export table data with its related optimizer statistics, and Oracle cannot verify the currency of these statistics.
When CBO statistics are created/updated with dbms_stats, the time is noted, but it's always a good idea not to export statistics since they should be
  recalculated after import.
You can remove the EXP-00091 error by exporting with statistics="none" or by setting the client character set (e.g.
export NLS_LANG=AMERICAN_AMERICA.WE8ISO8859P1).
regexp_matches() gives out all found groups as an array.
The clearest explanation I've ever read on the difference between user and system elapsed time was provided by [William Dunlap on [R-help] (hyper-link)]:
Here is some simple explanations:
Elapsed Time is the time charged to the CPU(s) for the expression.
The time that you as a user experienced.
exp is defined in the [JWT spec (hyper-link)].
It refers to when the JWT should be treated as "expired" (e.g.
As defined in that link you get the cancellation postback whenever Google can't obtain payment - I'd  interpret (defer to official Google support on this) that as being either the initial and/or renewal payment (because the user cancelled or some other reason - maybe expired card?
For a function as smooth and predictable as exp, a polynomial will give you much higher accuracy for the same amount of computational effort.
The required polynomials will depend on the tradeoff between complexity and accuracy, as well as whether you want to minimize expected error, minimize maximum error, or use some other loss function.
Restricting the domain of exp does not actually help that much, since it's so easy to expand to the entire domain.
[Fast Exp calculation: possible to improve accuracy without losing too much performance?
I found that when exp was called from particular places, the argument value was highly repeatable.
and wherever exp(foo) used to be called, do:
That way, exp doesn't get called if its argument at that place where it is called from has the same argument value as before.
I use this function to get payload , header , exp(Expiration Time), iat (Issued At) based on [this (hyper-link)] answer
I don't see any complex terms in that expansion by Wolfram, so I'd wonder why you think you need the complex number in the exponential term.
The Wolfram article has the expansion formula stated using q = e**(ix) so there is a complex term.
Use the export utilities on
the client to generate the export file.
Basically I rearranged my code to be able to use the expit function...
The parameterization of R's self-starting Gompertz function (?SSgompertz) is 
a*exp(-b2*b3^x) =  a*exp(-b2*exp(x*log(b3)) = a*exp(-b2*exp(x/(1/log(b3)))
Probably it is better to rely on the compiler and use the exp implementation from [http://www.netlib.org/fdlibm/e_exp.c (hyper-link)] .
and sample x from U(0,1) in [-a...a] interval, and for each x compute exp() and average it and get the result
From what I understand, you want to use exp() as PDF, so your integral looks like
The values in the exponent are now reasonable (on the order of 1 in my case) and there is no problem with overflows.
math.exp() expects a single floating point number, and you pass a Series instead.
Use numpy.exp() (a vectorized version of math.exp()).
Also, if you would like to stay with math.exp, you could go with apply
You need to use np.exp instead of math.exp.
You need to reference it explicitly:
Same for np.exp.
math.log expects a number, so it won't work with array or the sympy objects either.
sympy.sum expects an iterable, which this list qualifies.
However, whoever computes the exponent is unlikely to use the Taylor expansion since better methods exist.
As per glibc, it may use its own implementation which says this in the comment (from sysdeps/ieee754/dbl-64/e_exp.c):
Is the floating point implementation of exp() function in cmath equivalent to a truncated Taylor series expansion of a very high order?
That's because any decent implementation of exp() has an error of half an ULP (unit of least precision) or so.
However, no decent implementation of exp() will use a Taylor expansion.
Just an example how you could calculate exp (x):
Then exp (x) = 2^k * exp (x - k ln 2).
Anyway, we now calculate exp (x) where the result is between sqrt (1/2) and sqrt (2).
You could calculate exp (x) using a Taylor polynomial.
While [dtb's (hyper-link)] answer works for several scenarios, it is suboptimal as such an expression cannot be used in Entity Framework, as it cannot handle Invoke calls.
Unfortunately, to avoid those calls one needs a lot more code, including a new ExpressionVisitor derived class:
This replaces every instance of the first parameter in the first expression with the expression in the second expression.
Would yield the expression (Class2 c2) => c2.Class1Property.StringProperty.
Word boundaries apply for spaces and end of strings which are present in both of your regular expressions.
If x is larger than about 709 then you simply won't be able to represent np.exp(x) (or  1.
/ (1 + np.exp(x))) using a 64 bit float.
Beyond that you would need to rethink how you're computing your expansion, or else use something like [mpmath (hyper-link)] which supports arbitrary precision arithmetic.
You can use [scipy.special.expit(-x) (hyper-link)].
It will avoid the overflow warnings generated by 1.0/(1.0 + exp(x)).
The EXP utility is designed for moving schemas and whole databases.
That's why EXP doesn't have the option.
However it will be easier to use an IDE like PL/SQL Developer, which supports exporting tables' data in the form of INSERT statements.
As such exp(A) tries to perform the [matrix exponential (hyper-link)] which is only defined for square matrices.
Thus here, you want exp.
Therefore the answer is exp.
I'm not sure how everything is glued together and being sent, but you could have hidden input fields with the data-stripe="exp-month/year" attributes and then split the visible input value on / and set the hidden values.
You are not using regular expressions but strings.
You are searching with a string, not an expression.
As others noted, you can use regular expression literals instead of strings.
If a non-RegExp object obj is passed, it is implicitly converted to a RegExp by using new RegExp(obj).
The string will then be passed to the RegExp object behind the scenes.
Or more explicity:
Regex is always more expensive than a string search.
This is normal if one or more functions is/are exported from your executable.
Usually, with your dll built, you have also some others file generated (.exp, .lib) also for the NON dll projects.
This can occour when you include a .h file of the dll project, into the app project, which contains a class marked with __declspec(dllexport).
To avoid the linker think your are trying to include some .h files to "export" use a conditional expression to define your _declspec macro.
When you want to include this .h file into a NON dll project, you have simply to define the _DO_NOT_EXPORT condition
If you happen to be using MSVC 2013, one possible explanation is that you have some code somewhere that is trying to convert a float infinity to int.
Trigger that bug 8 times and your FPU stack is totally full, and any subsequent attempt to push a value (such as calling 'exp()') will result in an 'invalid operation' and return an indefinite (like 1.#IND).
To check if this is your issue, have a look at your FPU registers just prior to the bad call to 'exp()'.
Such a matrix does not implement the exp function, because that would convert all the 0s to 1s, resulting in a densely populated matrix.
To do your calculation using a sparse matrix, you can write 1 - np.exp(-A) as -(np.exp(-A) - 1) = -np.expm1(-A).
[expm1(x) (hyper-link)] is equivalent to exp(x) - 1.
The scipy sparse matrices have an expm1() method (which np.expm1 eventually calls), so you could also write that line as
the error is EXP-00026, which says
so you can't have both OWNER and TABLES specified as part of the export, one or the either but not both
I think the list elements were unknown to np.exp and it couldn't calculate it.
You need to use np.exp(array) function to calculate the exponential of all elements in array
(-Q*t)/V
The function exp is called the exponential function, and its inverse is the natural logarithm, or logarithm to base e. The number e is also commonly defined as the base of the natural logarithm
In other words, exp(x) and e^x are the same function.
So, the function exp(x) is technically valid for all values of x, but practically speaking, you can limit them.
The usual implementation for exponentiation is [square-and-multiply (hyper-link)] which makes use of the observation that you can break any exponentiation up into some number of squarings plus at most one more multiply.
[Here (hyper-link)] one can find a fast exp implementation that uses the SSE instructions.
Are you interested in the time taken by exponentiation, as compared to time taken by other floating-point operations?
Loop through a million floating-point assignments and time it, then loop through a million floating-point assignments of exponentials and time that, then subtract.
OK...with a little bit of looking at the API without assumptions I realised that the exp value had to be an int, not a string.
you need to specify which schema you want to export , by expdp user/password schema=abc dumpfile=abc.dmp logfile=abc.log directory=abcdirectory
Original Export is desupported for general use as of Oracle Database
11g.
The only supported use of original Export in Oracle Database 11g
is backward migration of XMLType data to Oracle Database 10g release 2
(10.2) or earlier.
Therefore, Oracle recommends that you use the new
Data Pump Export and Import utilities, except in the following
situations which require original Export and Import: You want to
import files that were created using the original Export utility
(exp).
You want to export files that will be imported using the original
Import utility (imp).
An example of this would be if you wanted to
export data from Oracle Database 10g and then import it into an
earlier database release.
I have a feeling it's been moved from the exp library to the new net library.
And using the exp start --tunnel method described in that post did generate a URL that my mobile phone expo app could actually interpret.

Now, navigate to the project directory and start exp server process with --tunnel option.
From the docs ([https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/exp-cli (hyper-link)]):
If you see a URL like exp://192.168.200.83:19000 instead, you should also see some logging message like

where the REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME is set to the exp URL from the previous step (info about this can be found in the README of every react-native app created via create-react-native-app).
And notice that on tab running the exp process, there should be instructions on how to open the project on different devices (the earlier in this answer for example).
Use these instructions to open the project for different devices using this tab we just opened (in my case, for an AVD, runnning exp android (you should see some message in the tab running the exp process like 22:28:57 [exp] Finished building JavaScript bundle in 97ms letting you know it is working)).
"
You can use the -exportpath command option to specify the locations of export
files.
The path consists of a list of root directories in which the Converter looks for
export files.
Export files must be named as the last portion of the package name
followed by the extension .exp.
Export files are located in a subdirectory called
javacard, following the Java Card directory naming convention.
For example, to load the export file of the package java.lang, if you have specified
-exportpath as c:\myexportfiles, the Converter searches the directory
c:\myexportfiles\java\lang\javacard for the export file lang.exp.
"
So use appropriate -exportpath option for converter to point to your exp files and be sure the javacard subdir is created under the package dir for holding exp files.
if you really need a drop in replacement for numpy.exp()
you can just make a function that behaves like it is written in the docs [https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.exp.html (hyper-link)]

If you mean math.exp from built-in module math in this place it does simply
instead of exp(x)
[The exponential function exp(a) is equivalent to e ** a (hyper-link)], where [e is Euler's number (hyper-link)].
Would a simple regular expression do the trick for you?
See the linked page, section Filter Expressions:
Reserved characters — The semicolon, comma, and backslash must all be
  backslash escaped when they appear in an expression.
To see why, try rewriting this as f(u) = 1-exp(-u), and taking a [Taylor series (hyper-link)] expansion at the point u=0.
If you are using C++11, for example, it has this function as part of the standard library: [expm1 (hyper-link)].
In your case, you would call it as -expm1(-mu*t).
Otherwise, you can derive the Maclaurin series for expm1 easily from the Maclaurin series for exp(x) by simply dropping the first 1.
One implementation is given below in expm1_maclaurin.
Comparing this with the built-in expm1:
For all positive x <= 1/8 the result is equal to full double precision of expm1.
${$exp} is a symbolic dereference.
If $exp is one, you get the text of $1.
You don't export Oracle queues using exp or expdp.
exp/imp queues will lead you into database catalog corruption.
Export import of queues is now fully supported at queue table level granularity.
The user only needs to export the queue table.
All the queues in the queue table, primary object grants, related objects like views, IOTs, rules are automatically exported.
This is only valid if you are exp/imp using 11GR2 as source and target database.
This is expected behaviour in 11.2.
There may be several implementations of Expect for Windows (unlike the Unix version, which has been stable for ages) and it sounds like the details of how they are implemented internally varies quite a bit between them.
Furthermore, the variable ::exp::winnt_debug is absolutely internal to a particular implementation.
The exp timestamp (and all other timestamps) in the JWT is a Unix-Timestamp (defined as seconds after 1970-1-1 00:00 UTC) (more details in [my answer here (hyper-link)]).
But you can decode the JWT on your client and then extract and convert the timestamp to local time if you, for example, want to build a mechanism to request a new access token with the refresh token when the current token is about to expire..
You are supplying a column vector from V to exp.
However, fitting the model this way allows you to input a scalar to exp, which you can then sum afterwards.
Due to your search expression, this capture group is the whole line.

I needed the following two tweaks to the python script to make it work with export cipher suites:
This is required because with export ciphers, the provided (1024-bit) RSA key is only used for authentication (signing), while a temporary, export-crippled 512-bit RSA key is used for confidentiality (encryption).
This is true not only for export cipher suites, but for all suites using DSS/DSA for authenticity.
DSS/DSA can by design only be used for signatures, not for encryption, in order to allow for export into untrusted countries.
There is also contributed package [Brobdingnag (hyper-link)] that can handle numbers much bigger than exp(710).
An explicitly vectorized (SSE) c version is about 2.5x faster than any of the alternatives that you posted on my machine (~360 us vs 150 us), for float32 data.
[http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/rmcgibbo/logsumexp/blob/master/Accelerating%20log-sum-exp.ipynb (hyper-link)]
One of the disadvantages of explicit SSE code is that it's very datatype specific, and I didn't take the effort to write a double precision version.
The full source code for the SSE implementation (BSD), with a simple setup.py installer is at [https://github.com/rmcgibbo/logsumexp/tree/master (hyper-link)]
This will show all the exports to begin with.
You're best off writing some code that calls exp/log a large number of times, and using time to call it a few times to see if there's a noticeable difference.
Both take basically the same time on my computer (Windows), so I'd use exp, since it's defined for all values (assuming you check for ERANGE).
Edit: Modified the code to avoid exp() overflow.
It actually seems to me like the [natural logarithm (hyper-link)] is easier to calculate than the [exponential function (hyper-link)]:
Due to this, I'd use the exp(a) > b, simply because it doesn't break on invalid input.
Since you're working with values << 1, note that x-1 > log(x) for x<1,
which means that  x-1 < log(y) implies log(x) < log(y), which already
takes care of 1/e ~ 37% of the cases without having to use log or exp.
It would make sense that log be faster... Exp has to perform several multiplications to arrive at its answer whereas log only has to convert the mantissa and exponent to base-e from base-2.
exp(300) is 1.942426e+130, which is [greater than the range of Oracle's NUMBER datatype (hyper-link)] - the biggest number you can have in Oracle is: 9.99...9 x 10125 with up to 38 significant digits.
So in short, no, you won't be able to calculate exp(300) in Oracle.
The EXP function is defined to take in a NUMBER and return a NUMBER.
So EXP function can't be directly used.
So for numbers upto E308, you can use that by breaking the exponents into NUMBERs smaller than E127, cast them into BINARY_DOUBLE and multiplying the result.
to calculate the exponent and return the result as a string.
[How to use a variable inside a regular expression?
You should use [jwt.verify (hyper-link)] it will check if the token is expired.
verify itself returns an error if expired.
Err means token is expired and will throw an error so you can remove stored token.
One good use case is displaying when the token expires in the frontend.
You need to un-quote the regex string so it's treated as a regular expression literal, so you get this:
Regular expressions in JavaScript don't need to be quoted as strings unless using the new Regexp() notation; in the above example, it is now a regular expression literal, which isn't treated as a string but a piece of regex to be used in .replace().
Regular Expressions in JavaScript are not strings.
If you wanted a regular expression match, you could do the following:
Taking the exp() of numbers very close to 0 in floating-point numbers is problematic, since the result is a number close to 1 while all the precision is in the difference to one, so most significant digits are lost.
It is more precise (and significantly faster in this testcase) to compute exp(x) - 1 through the C math library function expm1(x).
If the exp() itself is really needed, it is still much faster to do expm1(x) + 1.
For an experienced programmer it may be possible to write an approximative implementation of a slow function using methods like Newton-Raphson, Taylor or Maclaurin polynomials, specifically inexactly rounded specialty functions from libraries like Intel's MKL, AMD's AMCL, relaxing the floating-point standard compliance of the compiler, reducing precision to ieee754 binary32 (float), or a combination of these.
Your original code above seems to have a max possible argument for exp() of a=(1+2*0x400)/0x2000...=4.55e-13 (that should really be 2*0x3FF, and I'm counting 13 zeroes after your 0x2000... which makes it 2x16^13).
And then the trivial taylor expansion is exp(a)=1+a+(a^2)/2+(a^3)/6+... which already gives you all double's precision for such small arguments.
Now, you'll have to discard the 1 part, as explained above, and then that just reduces to expm1(a)=a*(1.+a*(1.+a/3.)/2.)
Compile and run it as test to reproduce OP's 0x2000... scenario, or run it with (up to three) optional args test  #trials  multiplier  timeexp where #trials defaults to the OP's 1000000, and multipler defaults to 2 for the OP's 2x16^13 (change it to 4, etc, for her other tests).
For the last arg, timeexp, enter a 0 to do only the expm1() (and my unnecessary taylor-like) calculation.
The point of that is to show that the bad-timing-cases displayed by the OP disappear with expm1(), which takes "no time at all" regardless of multiplier.
So the first thing you'll note is that the OP's c-n using exp() differs substantially from both cm1==tm1 using expm1() and my taylor approx.
And as far as timing of exp() versus expm1() is concerned, see for yourself...
Question: you'll note that once the exp() calculation reaches N=10000 trials, its sum remains constant regardless of larger N. Not sure why that would be happening.
And that indeed works to bring the exp() sum closer (much closer) to the (presumably correct) expm1() sum.
That's gone, and in its same place is expon so that denominator is now 2^expon where the default is 53, matching OP's default (and I believe better matching how she was thinking about it).
Okay, and now you can notice two additional command-line args following the old timeexp.
Note how the c-n for exp() converges pretty nicely towards the expm1() value.
But then I found that trecu() generated exactly (and I mean exactly) the same answer as the "plain sum" c using exp(), not the sum cm1 using expm1() that we'd expected from a more accurate binary tree summation.
In that preceding case, my iterative code indeed came close to the cm1 answer, which is why I'd expected EOF's recursive trecu() to do the same.
Okay, so who'd like to take on the challenge and explain what's going on in that trecu() recursion?
Regular Expressions are good, but sometimes there is an easier way.
In Visual Studio, an [export (.exp) file (hyper-link)] is created so that others can link against your library.
For your typical mex file, no one will be linking against it, therefore the .exp files are not necessary.
I don't have Visual Studio currently, but you could probably search your local machine for that .exp file just to verify that it is indeed created and it's just placed somewhere that MATLAB isn't expecting.
Combining all of the above, yields the following final expression:
In order to exclude the chosen value in the variable worphrase from being found within a tag value property (such as <input value="worphrase">), the following regexp searches for the pattern of a > character followed by non <> characters and the content of worphrase followed by (eventually) a < character:
Note that this updates the commented regexp to exclude both <> characters on each side of the given worphrase variable content.
Many sed dialects also have an option like -E or -r to enable extended (aka "modern") regular expressions, but what exactly that means and what the option is called depends on the version of sed.
The simplest way is to use exponent approximation.
The other idea is the polynomial expansion.
In particular, taylor series expansion:
Note that with the same number of expansion terms, you can get a better approximation if you approximate the function for the specific x range, using  for example the least squares method.
There is a trick to approximate an exponent in a very wide range but with a noticeable piecewise linear regions.
[Piecewise linear approximation to exponential and logarithm (hyper-link)]
[A Fast, Compact Approximation of the Exponential Function (hyper-link)]
As you can see, the best approximation in this case is given by the method fastExp2(x), slightly worse but acceptable is fastExp1(x).
The worst approximation provides by fastExp3(x) - the piecewise stucrure is noticeable, discontinuities of the first derivative is presence.
[ (hyper-link)]
In the range x = [0..10) fastExp3(x)  method provides the best approximation, a bit worse is approximation given by  fastExp1(x) - with the same number of calculations, it provides more order than fastExp2(x).
The next step is to improve the accuracy of the fastExp3(x) algorithm.
The easiest way to significantly increase accuracy is to use equality exp(x) = exp(x/2)/exp(-x/2) Although it increases the amount of computation, it greatly reduces the error due to mutual error compensation when dividing.
Even greater accuracy can be achieved by combining methods from fastExp1(x) or fastExp2(x) and fastExp3(x) algorithms using equality exp(x+dx) = exp(x) *exp(dx).
As shown above, the first multiplier can be computed similar to fastExp3(x) approach, for second multiplier fastExp1(x) or fastExp2(x) method can be used.
There are several libraries that provide vectorized exponential, with more or less accuracy.
[fmath (hyper-link)] is another option, you can tear the code from the vectorized exp to integrate it inside your loop.
From experience, all these are faster and more precise than a custom padde approximation (not even talking about the unstable Taylor expansion that would give you negative number VERY quickly).
For SVML, IPP and MKL, I would check which one is better: calling from inside your loop or calling exp with one call for your full array (as the libraries could use AVX512 instead of just SSE2).
There is no SSE2 implementation of exp so if you don't want to roll your own as suggested above, one option is to use AVX512 instructions on some hardware that supports ERI (Exponential and Reciprocal Instructions).
See [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512#New_instructions_in_AVX-512_exponential_and_reciprocal (hyper-link)]
You will first need to convert the Exp into an Acc, then run that, and finally index the resulting array:
As you seem to target an Excel export, you probably don't need a list.
If the hidden rows still appear in the Excel export, I suggest to exclude them from the dataset by using the report parameters (as @RptRunDate and @PlanYearExpDate) in a WHERE clause of the query that is used to create the dataset.
"exp" is a generic function, that returns the same type as its argument -- precision of real or complex.
It should be used in preference to the older form "dexp" because with "exp" the compiler will automatically return the correct type.
The answer to part 2 of your question is that the range of the exponential function is the set of all positive real numbers.
As mentioned before, it is always better to use the generic functions, such as EXP(), in preference to the outdated type specific equivalents, such as DEXP().
So if you wanted the exponential function would need: EXP() for single precision numbers,  DEXP() for double precision numbers, or CEXP() for complex numbers.
In principle the possible range of the exponent can be processor and compiler dependent.
For example, suppose you to make sure that x is of a type with decimal precision of at least 10 digits and a decimal exponent range of at least 100.
The expiration time of a JWT is merely a [claim (hyper-link)]; in other words, the server can choose (this being the operative word) not to process the token when a certain timestamp has passed.
It completely depends on the JWT implementation in use if it will enforce the expiration, or if the developer has to do that manually.
For instance, the [jsonwebtoken (hyper-link)] package's default setting is to fail verification for JWT's if they have expired.
However, you can [tell it to ignore the expiration (hyper-link)].
This also means that the developer has to choose when to update the expiration time of a token (a fixed amount of time after logging in, or after last interacting with the server, or something else entirely).
where each fragment: \(, [^)]+ and \) - expresses each of the
above conditions.
Note: If spaces after ( and before ) are optional, then you can express it
with ?
I think you can achieve it using REGEXP_SUBSTR as follows:
You can use the optional outargument of exp:
exp(x[, out])
Calculate the exponential of all elements in the input array.
out : ndarray
     Output array, element-wise exponential of x.
Here all elements of a will be replaced by the result of exp.
Thus, a safe way to do this is to typecast your array to float64 or float32 etc., before doing exp like,
Type Casting & exp:
That said, it happens when the result of exp(-value) exceeds the maximum number representable by value's floating point data type format.
If t is a matrix, you need to use the element-wise multiplication or exponentiation.
Your assumption seems to be rooted in Sexp(token, i).
It appears that your test is whether token[i] by itself is an S-exp?
But that's not what the grammar says: an S-exp can be more than one token.
It might be that I misinterpret your meaning of Sexp(token,i).
Another interpretation would be "does a S-exp token start at token[i]"?
If you're using the old export (exp) then no, you'd need to do a separate export for each table.
If you're using data pump (expdp) then yes, you can specify multiple QUERY clauses and specify which table each applies too.
Source: [Multiple table export in oracle (hyper-link)]
(I cannot use expdp because I don't have access to the database server.
I create a table EXP_ROW_ID as follows
Then I put the ROWID of the rows I want to export from the 2 tables
Then I export the dump using following command
expdp system/xxxxxx tables=TABLE_A query=\"WHERE A_ID = 1001\"
As always, [regular-expressions.info (hyper-link)] is a good place to start.
The Regex Tutorial has a page on it here: [http://www.regular-expressions.info/atomic.html (hyper-link)]
Based on your examples, the bulk of the expression should not match a question mark, fragment hash or double quote:
You told bison the relative precedence of the production exp: exp '(' exp ')' and the lookahead symbol +.
But you haven't told bison the relative precedence of the production exp: exp '+' exp and the lookahead symbol (.
It allowed me to compute the formula a = x * exp(iy), as I wanted.
Localhost option may work as well but according to [Expo Debugging docs (hyper-link)]:
Also, here is a visual informative answer that I wrote a few months ago that may also help: [How do I run an app on a real iOS device using Expo?
Close and start Expo app, scan barcode
Maybe this might be helpful to simply explain that, such an error occurs if your phone and your computer are on different networks.
Assumptions: Installed Expo ([https://expo.io (hyper-link)]) on Computer via NPM/Yarn and installed Expo on Android/iPhone.
Mine was Ip v4 : 192.168.1.xxx
Type in the web browser on the Phones web Browser URL : exp://192.168.1.xxx:19000
Then should see some text, which means the phone is connecting via the Network (good sign)
Then open expo on Phone, and should see link via Clipboard.
Click on Link via Clipboard which is inside the Expo program on the phone.
P.s Follow instructions for giving Expo permission etc when it works for the first time.
The problem here is that Expo shows the wrong IP address which your phone can't connect to.
Now open any text editor in your phone and type
exp://192.168.xx.x:19000.
Open Expo app.
Now anytime you want to load an app, you can copy the same address and open it in Expo.
Run the command
  set REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=192.168.xx.x before expo start.
This
  will set the correct IP in Expo Dev Tools.
I recommend deleting the .expo folder before running Yarn :)
Try extracting the "value" for each before using them as an argument to np.exp():
Let's look at just the exponent in your exponential, which normally should be a dimensionless quantity.
Now your exponent is properly a dimensionless quantity:
(In this case the dimensionless values were all so close to zero that the exponents round to 1--if this is not correct then you'll want to check some of my assumptions about your units).
Then write the exponent in your Plank's law equation like:
Regular expressions aren't needed -- you can do this with string operations.
According to the [documentation (hyper-link)], ngMessageExp directive is not defined in Angularjs 1.3.
EXP(X)
Exponential.
So, to make it clear and short: Don't even try to use regular expressions.
explanation:
If in doubt, be explicit.
std::exp() in the standard library, using double
Rcpp::exp() from Rcpp Sugar, using our vectors
arma::exp() from Armadillo using its vectors
and I always found it easiest to be explicit.
It then propagates into the final type signature because you're using (**) for exponentiation which expects its arguments to be the same type:
One option is to use (^) for exponentiation instead:
It's possibly a better fit for this case because your exponents will be integers, although it may be a bit less efficient as it uses repeated multiplication (logarithmic in the exponent) rather than constant-time floating point operations.
You need to provide exp as NumericDate.
See documentation: [https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken#token-expiration-exp-claim (hyper-link)]
Here is exp1's inner loop (embedded in quite a bit of additional code which will never be executed because you've already reserved):
And here's exp2's:
In practice, they are basically the same, because exp is complicated and GCC doesn't know how to automatically vectorize it.
Still, my main point is that yes, you actually can do marginally better than reserve + push_back (this surprised me quite a bit when I first found out), and that it would be significantly better if we weren't dealing with exp in particular.
You need to get the tools package, oracle-instantclient12.2-tools-12.2.0.1.0-1.x86_64.rpm, in addition to the basic package, to be able to use exp and imp (and their datapump equivalents; and SQL*Loader).
All experience and levels gained will be reset back to a newly created Player.
The behaviors of expt and exp are described in the HyperSpec entry, [EXP (hyper-link)], [EXPT (hyper-link)].
(exp n) returns en, whereas (expt x y) returns xy.
exp and expt perform exponentiation.
exp returns e raised to the power number, where e is the base of the
  natural logarithms.
exp has no branch cut.
expt returns base-number raised to the power power-number.
For expt of a
  complex rational to an integer power, the calculation must be exact
  and the result is of type (or rational (complex rational)).
In the glossary, on page 519 (first edition), there are descriptions of Common Lisp's exp and expt.
Tanimoto is developing a symbolic algebra system, and is using the symbol exp in representing exponential expressions.
the value of f0 is just the list (d (+ (exp x 2) (* 2 x)) x)).
The point is that it is an algebraic expression.

  AttributeError: 'float' object has no attribute 'exp'
The old 'exp' utility does provide many options and can get you backup of tables and triggers ONLY (not sequence or any other type objects).
Pls use advanced 'expdp' (data pump) for better options.
The second column of X is defined by exp(1) + exp(2) * (0.1:0.1:2))
The result is multiplied with the sum of exp(1) + exp(2):
The standard does not define how the exp function (or any other math library function1) should be implemented, thus each library implementation may use a different computing method.
For instance, the Android C library ([bionic (hyper-link)]) uses an approximation of exp(r) by a special rational function on the interval [0,0.34658] and scales back the result.
In order to get the same implementation in both (all) platforms, you could use your own implementation of the exp function, thus not relying on the different implementations of the different libraries.
Use scipy.special.erfcx() which gives exp(x**2)*erfc(x).
Then you just implement erfcx(x)*exp(x-x**2) which again gives erfc(x)*exp(x).
Cadena proposed to approximate the complementary error function in terms of another exponential function with a negative power term.
It reduces the high power raised by the original exponential function that causes overflow.
is a valid Fortran expression then it might be a statement function.
It's possible that it assigns the value of exp(x) to the x-th element of an array called f but that suggests that x is an integer.
In particular, it will use std::exp and std::log unless the value type has its own overloads.
If you sort the inputs, the very first value will be max_elem, so the first term of sum will be exp(VT{0} which presumably is VT{1}.
By doing the tests separately, you don't run into issues with the order in which characters are found in the string vs. the order in which you've listed them in your expression.
Your regular expression includes the part [,] which translates as "must contain a comma in that position".
If the comma should have been optional that part of the expression should have been [,]?
Final working expression was ^(\[)(\d{1,2}([-]\d{1,2})?[,]?
)*(\])$ which passes on all of your expected inputs.
This is not necessary when your class of characters has just one character, and makes a hard-to-read syntax like regexp even harder.
Your expression can be shortened to ^(\[)(\d{1,2}(-\d{1,2})?,?
The problem was with me using math.exp instead of np.exp.
You can simply divide the numerator and denominator by the same factor exp(c) for suitably sized  c.
According to the [Oracle docs (hyper-link)] you can specify that the job doing the export produce values in a given version.
That is to say, you can tell the job doing the export to produce 10g output so that it can be accepted by the destination database.
You'd need to use a 10g exp to do the export from 11g and the 10g imp to import into 10g.
A 10g imp will refuse to work with an 11g exp
It means the pointer value is equal to the address of the exp symbol plus 6.
You might expect to see such notation when examining the disassembly of a function's code, e.g.
numpy's exp is a function, not a number.
Just replace exp() by exp(1) and you are good to go.
obj += np.sum((y + 1).dot((np.log(1 + np.exp(-theta))))),
np.log(1 + np.exp(-theta) was exploding.
-np.log(1/(1 + np.exp(theta))
It defines the expression assert(anything) to do nothing.
To expand on what bdonlan says, the reason the macro does not expand empty is because if it did, then something like:
If you do this,
  the assert macro expands to (void(0))
I'm sure you know that [since August 2020 Cognito allows you to configure access token expiry time from 5 mins to 1 day (hyper-link)].
Either your session expires and you have to login again after a fixed length of time (e.g.
Your best bet is to email the authors for guidance, they can point you in the right direction or connect you to someone experienced in extending their cart.
Basically, the expression $(hamletFile "fileList.hamlet") means "execute this function call at compile-time to generate from Haskell source code".
As Bartek and MathematicalOrchid are both saying, hamletFile "fileList.hamlet" has type Q Exp, which means "GHC can run this to generate an expression."
By wrapping it in $(...), you're saying, "GHC, please generate an expression."
The next question you need to ask it: what's the type of this generated expression?
You can get more information in the [shakespeare chapter of the Yesod book (hyper-link)], but the expression will have type:
The parseInt is not necessary since javascript cast automatically the express to an number.
More precise (explicit power series):
SENTINEL_VALUE is a small value that determines the precision you want on the calculation and depends on the actual application (I'm guessing some gaussian statistics) THRESHOLD is basically the error you would want to tolerate on the taylor expansion.
Or choose a fixed number of terms from the taylor expansion.
The disadvantage of this approach is uncontrolled precision but the advantage is constant time evaluation and you can store the expansion terms in an array and reuse them.
Note: Given an proportional error in x as err, the proportional error in exp(x) is err*exp(x).
Not quite stdout/stdin but it is possible to export to and import from unix pipes.
I'll explain why you are seeing this error, and then how to fix it.
If the Unix time on your local machine and the Box server are out of sync, you will see the exp claim error.
so roughly t=exp(-2e19)  (ie t=1/((e^(2*10^19)))
That is a very small number.
Consider that 
exp(big"-1e+10") = 9.278...e-4342944820
and
exp(big"-1e+18") = 2.233...e-434294481903251828
and yes, julia says: 
exp(big"-2e+19) = 0.0000
exp(big"-2e+19) is a very small number.
At precision 8192, exp(-2e10)=0
So same result.
But rather the range of the exponant.
MPFR use something kinda like IEEE style floats, where precision is the length of the mantissa, and then you have a exponent.
2^exponent * mantissa
So there is a limit on the range of the exponent.
Function: mpfr_exp_t mpfr_get_emin (void)
  Function: mpfr_exp_t mpfr_get_emax (void)
Return the (current) smallest and largest exponents allowed for a floating-point variable.
The smallest positive value of a floating-point variable is one half times 2 raised to the smallest exponent and the largest value has the form (1 - epsilon) times 2 raised to the largest exponent, where epsilon depends on the precision of the considered variable.
exp(x) = 2^(log(2,e)*x)
So we can exp(z) = 2^(log(2,e)*z)

log(2,e)*z          = -29196304319863382016
Base.MPFR.get_emin() = -4611686018427387903
So since the exponent (rough -2.9e19)  is less than the minimum allowed exponent (roughly -4.3e17).
It may (or may not) be possible to recomplile MPFR with Int128 exponents, but julia hasn't.
