Hi friends, in this lesson
we're gonna make capthca with python
first of all what is capthca?
why it is using?
i want to tell about what is that?
may be some of my followers don't know its aim.
may be someone who is new to programming
 
captha is a security test against bot
when internet is in its early phases, there are no need to security for bots
when its come to turkey there are no need to captcha
in over time it became mandotary
couse forms are being filled with bots
 
and bots attempts to enter the site like a user
bots want to crack passwords
and we must prevent the bots
 
they must prove they are human
so we are using captcha
lets say we have a website
and there are form related with database
if you use it defenceless, hackers may attack your website
they use bots for filling forms and attack on your db
over time your db became useless, they want to crack your login process
and ofcourse you have used captchas before
and these are some captcha styles you may have been used before
they used with chaotic text and numbers with different fonts and some other random shapes on them
and etc.
they ask the characters, and you read it and enter it which will be diffucult for bots
theese captchas can be cracked with image processing techniques which is used ai and ann
Hackers trying to crack biggest websites captchas with theese techniques
There are a lot of well known captcha programa and the hackers are already crack them
in this example text is morning overlooks, you can easily crack it with image processing
you must create more diffucult captchas with more complex shapes and fonts
and there are some new captchas
ie. 3d captchas
and new generation with some small images
they ask for numbers or some objects
new captcha types are harder to crack
and new bots are trying to solve the puzzle
with image processing
every time new captchas created and cracked
and now some additional security settings are applied like sms etc.
some other capthcas like 3d ones
 
they designed for some angels
rarely they are designed as quadratic
 
and they are diffucult to cracked by bots
 
 
it is hard to detect characters by image processing
 
capthca tehnologies are developing
in oython we use canvas element
you can find canvas tutorials in our tutorial series
lesson 38 and others are about canvas
to 45
about canvas
we use canvas to create our special captcha
our special captha is important
because bots are specialized for well known capthas
if you create your own, and add more complex shape on it, bots will slog on
bots would be rewritten to crack your special captcha
So it is very important to create your own capthca for security of your web and another programs
we use canvas in python
import tkinter library
by adding * get all sub libraries
we are creating a window
we do not need to "as" here
close the window loop
we have a window now
setting the diamension of our window
with geometry method
and now enter the
300 width
 
200 height
windows diemensions
 
we have an errror, ups i have run previous code
here our window
here we put our captcha area
and i have a button, when click on it it will create random captchas
also you can make it via loop
or when sign in to system
i will make it with button
lets create canvas on window
