i'm going to present our research
about anomaly detection using our stm
auto encoder to practical perforate
their condition
on call fire power plant for the
background
python is a subcritical thermal power
plant that constructed in 1993
that is designed to consume high rancol
or sub vitamins a
nowadays competition with new power
plant that has high efficiency
conserved python to reduce the
production cost by switching the
chlorine consumption
become low wrinkled this action impacted
the equipment reliability
especially for the major equipment
example purporizer
maintain the core perforator working in
normal condition
is crucial to ensure the safety and
economically of the power generation
reliability of the equipment can be
accessed by using prognostic and health
management or phm method
the phm will observe the call
properizing system working condition
based on the condition monitoring data
and also detect the anomaly of the
equipment
anomaly detection with a database
approach is more widely used
because historical cm data enables to
find accurate information and
decision-making
many supervised learning method is used
because it has high sensitivity
of quantity and quality of the training
data
our research objective is using lstm
auto encoder methods
to predict the condition of pulperizer
in a
fire power plant by detecting anomalies
that cure in the equipment
lastly i will solve the problem of the
gradient reduction if the para is large
and out the encoder will improve the
generalizability
of the model by reducing the data
first about the product scene using lstm
unless lstm is a type of deep learning
that can approximate any complex
function form
and find a linear relation between
nonlinear data deep learning allows us
to explore hidden relationships
between data that the maximum potential
of data
can be used lstm can avoid long-term
dependencies
by delivery design the lstm cell
is composed of forgot input and output
kits
sigmoid or g is used to activate the
gate then the status and get input
unit are converted to 10 each the weight
of neurons
and the bias are denoted by w and d
respectively
second anomaly detection using
autoencoder or ie
alternate encoders can learn to
represent input data effectively through
the unsupervised learning
this process is referred to as encoding
and has a similar size than the input
data
so ie can be used to decrease the
dimension
aim maps the input or x to an implicit
layer
h this process is defined as encode
and the output h of the hidden layer
reconstruct the z of the output layer
with the same structure as the
x of the input layer and this process is
given as decode
z is the is a prediction of the data x
using feature h
third is control chart the control chart
contains
three horizontal lines which are center
lines upper control limit lines and the
lower
control limit lines the center line
represent the average value
of the quality of characteristic
corresponding
to the in control stage the process is
assumed
to be controlled if all sample points
are between two control limits
when stable points fall outside to
control image it indicates that the
process is out of the control
so investigation and corrective action
is needed to find and
eliminate the determinable cows or
causes responsible
for this behavior and then
about the material and the method first
we will reconstruction
time series data pattern using lstm
autoencoder
altenew encoder is one of the main
differences of the deep neural network
that is used to reconstruct
the data enter autoencoder can be used
to detect anomalies
by training models from normal data when
the
optimal data is found this model cannot
be reconstructed
into input data risk construction that
occurs will be
far from the input data which make the
gap between the input data and
reconstruction data
after calculating the gap value it will
be determined
whether the data are included in the
anomaly
long short term memory is a type of
neural network
or rnn that can reconstructing time
series data pattern
rns employ feedback connection from
their output layers back to the input
layers
where its of this feedback connection
can be used to serve
as a time delay gate therefore rn
architecture can represent explicitly
the influence of the past output values
on the computation
of the current output making it ideal
to model the autocorrelation structure
of the time series or sequence data
this is a figure 3
show the illustration of lstm auto
encoder application the second we will
create the upper limit and lower limit
the upper limit and lower limit are
determined based on the output of
outline for the signal
then the average value and the standard
deviation
are calculated and calculated so that
the upper limit
and lower limit are obtained figure 4
show us about the illustration of lstm
outer encoder application
and upper limit and lower limit result
is about modern data for this research
we will use
equipment pulverizer a with total
available sensor
is 24 tags data period
from december 2016 to june 2017
data story taken for
for 30 minutes
about the result first we will perform
auto encoder modeling
of its sensor data to get the upper
limit and lower limit control chart
figure 6 shows us about the upper limit
and lower limit of the encoder sensor
itby001 from the video we can see that
black solid line is the real data
and then the blue dashed line is the
lower control limit
and upper control limit
second we will accumulate the amount of
data that exceed the upper limit and
lower linear
figure 7 show the accumulation of the
amount of data except the upper limit
for the itb y001 sensor
the y-axis is the anomaly count
this is at the amount of the data that
except the upward limit
or lower limit and the x-axis is the
time index
maximum accumulation of the amount of
data except the upper limit per day
of the pulperaser motor current sensor
per year december 2016 until july 2017
is about 20. the sample accumulation of
the amount of data is in the upper limit
for pulp raises sensors is stability in
table 1.
table one show us about the samples of
accumulation of amount of data
above the upper limit on some sensors
third we will creating a threshold for
anomaly identification
based on the daily historical
accumulation the threshold is used to
make criteria for an event to be
classified into an anomaly
the threshold use is passed on a 95
percent quantile
of the daily accumulation data that has
gases exceed the limit
if an observation is equal to or
accept the threshold the observation is
an
anomaly feature 8 show us about the
threshold accumulated amount of data
above the upper limit and lower limit
for itby-001 sensor
as we can see there are several data
that extend the upper limit but
there is no data that except the lower
limit
for the sensor
for we will do the validation of the
anomaly detection result
we expect some sensor can capture
anomalous even before one to three days
before
of the sequence of event equipment
pulverizer
a gas has four soe in feature 10
show us about the anomaly capture on
itby itby-001 sensor
one to three days before soa occurs
based on
the accumulation of data amount above
the upper limit because
because there is no data except the
lower limit
as we can see from this figure there is
soe happened
in 25th january 2017
and we can see the anomaly capture
before
the soi happened
detail of the anomalous event date and
the sensor that captured the pattern
can be seen in table two table two
show us about the list of sensor tags
detecting
anomalies about one two three days
before soe
this is based on the upper limit price
hold
as we can see from this table there are
several
several data that can capture anomalies
before the soa
cures the result that have
been shown in figure 10 proved that lstm
auto encoder can capture anomalous even
before the sof
happened and an anomaly that captured
its sensor
showed the current condition or the
phenomena that occur inside
of the pulverizer after obtaining the
anomaly data
from its sensor a symptom cause logic is
built by the engineer
a symptom cause luggage proposed to
determine the condition of the equipment
this condition will be followed up by
the plant operator
to avoid or reduce the impact of the
failure that it will
occur an anomaly that it takes before
sla
can be using as an early warning to
operator then they can prepare
and do an anticipated action before the
failure occurs
for the conclusion this study choose
fulfilled a
equipment as a trial to implement
anomaly detection using the lstm of the
encoded approach
that learns to reconstruct normal time
series behavior
and thereafter use reconstruction error
to detect the anomalies
as a result this means this method can
capture anomaly events before i saw it
cures
based on the accumulation of data among
above the upper limit
the accuracy of the purpose model points
out the reliability of the architecture
which might
lead the power plant to get an alert
before the britain
cures therefore management might have a
challenge
to reduce the maintenance costs while
increasing revenue and service quality
our future research is to calculate the
cost benefit analysis
of data and plan maintenance costs
versus data plane maintenance
to confusing the economic visibility of
this research
