I can choose Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence/Information Science for Bachelor and Computer Science/Artificial Intelligence/Software Engineering/Security and network Engineering etc. For Masters. What should I choose for making bank and knowledge?
fourier_transform__: Doesnt matter
saixj: cs and machine learning enge
knilecrack: @VirloCOD go with something that suits you the best
masters8: Bro you really think hes gonna read that
0xnan: btw george the magnitude of gradients is related to _how fast_ the loss change
fourier_transform__: Everything they will teach you will be similar in each branch
knilecrack: try playing with everything and what you find intereting go for it
jakeprogramming: Stochastic gradient descent. You want to look at the gradients over time. This will tell you if your function is approaching the minimum or maximum(Reinforcement learning we want to maximize our reward). In addition, the goal is to reach a global minimum or maximum. Essentially a NN is a big mathematical model of data transformations.
saixj: yea^
