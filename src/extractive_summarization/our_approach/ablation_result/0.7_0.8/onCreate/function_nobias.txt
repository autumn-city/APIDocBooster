onCreate() is only run when the database file did not exist and was just created. 
The database is not opened when the database helper object itself is created. 
For development time schema upgrades where data loss is not an issue, you can just use execSQL("DROP TABLE IF EXISTS <tablename>") in to remove your existing tables and call onCreate() to recreate the database. 
onCreate will be invoked only when getWritableDatabase() or getReadableDatabase() is executed.  And this will only invoked once when a DBName specified in the first step is not available.
