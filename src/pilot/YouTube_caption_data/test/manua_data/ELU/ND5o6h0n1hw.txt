Let me share with you a dream.
Imagine this simple concept that you can code a deep learning models with an efficient  graphical tool
No complicated syntaxes to learn and with only your imagination as restriction.
It is not a dream !  it exists and it is HAIBAL.
Let's take an example to better understand.
By simply dragging and dropping layers on your desktop to design your graph
HAIBAL allows you to design any deep learning model.
here you have now an auto encoder.
The autoencoder can be used to reconstruct an image from a noisy image.
Now we have  designed it
All we have to do is run it and observe how it works.
 As we can see, HAIBAL is governed by the dataflow.
With this new simple way of thinking.
HAIBAL opens up new perspectives and opportunities in the design of deep learning models
in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, medicine, research and more.
HAIBAL API is also scalable and modular because he is coded in LabVIEW industrial graphics language
Draw any graph and run it
Integrate your model in your Labview systems
HAIBAL is also fully compatible with the Pytorch and KERAS APIs.
You can convert any model from these languages
About the High Performance Computing.
Haibal is optimized for GPU, CPU and FPGA.
