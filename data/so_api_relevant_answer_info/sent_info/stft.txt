Found another STFT, but no corresponding inverse function:
[http://code.google.com/p/pytfd/source/browse/trunk/pytfd/stft.py (hyper-link)]
For this example, I use a naive overlap-and-add method in istft.
There are probably more principled ways of computing the ISTFT.
Here is the STFT code that I use.
STFT + ISTFT here gives perfect reconstruction (even for the first frames).
[librosa.core.stft (hyper-link)] and [istft (hyper-link)] look pretty similar to what I was looking for, though they didn't exist at the time:
librosa.core.stft(y, n_fft=2048, hop_length=None, win_length=None, window=None, center=True, dtype=<type 'numpy.complex64'>)
I'm a little late to this, but realised scipy has inbuilt [istft (hyper-link)] function as of 0.19.0
Where a signal has N real samples, then STFT might have 4N complex samples -- 8 times more data.
It follows that the ISTFT operation must discard 7/8 of the data you provide it.
Most of the data in a STFT is redundant, and if you just make up values for all of the data, it is unlikely to correspond to a real signal.
In that case, an implementation of ISTFT will probably use a least-squares fit or other method of producing a signal with an STFT that matches your data as closely as possible, but it won't always be close.
librosa.core.frames_to_time does not take stft[0] as argument, which would be the frequency bins of the first frame.
Then you run an STFT over it using n_fft=2000 and hop_length=1000.
stft[0] is not a frame number.
Instead the first stft is of shape (1 + n_fft/2, t) (see [here (hyper-link)]).
The total number of frames in stft is therefore stft.shape[1].
Definition of the parameter boundary=None (in the scipy.signal.stft) will remove the first spectrum the t=0
I dont know your STFT and ISTFT functions, are you using phase information too ?
Now to your graph: It seems that you a time-invariant signal and thus, that there is no need for performing an STFT.
steady => no need for an STFT and
If you sum up the amplidues of the STFT, you will have the same amplitudes... almost because you have a worse frequency resolution because your signal-length is smaller (frequency resolution = 1/T_signal)
The 'FrequencyRange' parameter to stft is new in MATLAB R2020b.
(You can see this by checking the reference page from R2020a [https://www.mathworks.com/help/releases/R2020a/signal/ref/stft.html (hyper-link)] ).
As a result the spectrum is fully determined by N//2 + 1 frequency point (which is the size of spectrum returned by scipy.signal.stft).
Be careful to pass the same parameters that you use for your stft() call.
Then, if you want to include frequencies from 0Hz to frequencies no greater than max_frequency as part of your STFT output, the maximum size along the frequency axis should be given by:
As a special case you can also verify that when max_frequency is set to the Nyquist frequency (250000/2 = 125000), the computed size is 1+floor(125000/400) = 313 (which matches your full spectrum STFT output size).
In X you have the complex-valued STFT.
It is simply shifting the pitch (as you stated), firstly using the short time fourier transform (STFT), doing some processing and then transforming back with an in inverse short time fourier transform (ISTFT).
The github [link (hyper-link)] to the pitchshifter is actually a really nice place to start, I suggest you take the STFT code+logic from there and try to make it work yourself.
See how they implement the STFT on line 242 and how they use this on line 125.
The next is to model the fact that your STFT contains a lot of constant value at the low frequencies.
Librosa's STFT is full-featured so unless you're very careful with how you manipulate the spectrum, you won't get a sensible output from its istft.
Here's a pair of functions, stft and istft, that I wrote from scratch that represent the forward and inverse STFT, along with a helper method that gives you the time and frequency locations of each pixel in the STFT array, plus a demo:
You can definitely generalize this to complex data (or use librosa), but for your application (audio masking), using the real-only transforms makes it easier to ensure that everything works out and the output of the inverse STFT is real-only (it's easy to mess this up if you're doing the fully-general complex STFT, where you need to be careful in maintaining symmetries).
The demo first generates some test data and confirms that the istft on the stft of the data produces the data again.
The demo plots the STFT (by taking the absolute value of the STFT array):
put this code in a stft.py file,
import it as import stft,
compute an STFT as spectrum = stft.stft(y, 128),
visualize your spectrum as shown in the demo (be sure to prepend stft.
to functions defined in stft.py!
finally getting the processed audio via back_y = stft.istft(spectrum, 128).
You should use tf.signal.inverse_stft_window_fn

We cannot reconstruct exactly the STFT from a Mel spectrogram.
The reason is that we the Mel is a 'compressed' version of the STFT with the frequencies coming from the Mel scale and then applying (to the STFT) triangular filters at these frequencies.
Generally, we lose information going from STFT to mel.
The way it is done in the paper is to use a neural network to transform Mel to STFT.
To set up this network, convert ground truth (target) audio into Mels, and create a recurrent network (CBHG or anything else) to transform it into STFT equivalents.
Minimize loss between these STFT predictions and the actual STFT which we can create from target audio.
As for your other question, well, theoretically the bandwidth of an FFT is infinite but we band-limit our result to the band of frequencies in the range [-fs/2 to fs/2] because all frequencies outside that band are susceptible to [aliasing (hyper-link)] and are therefore of no use.Furthermore, if the input signal is real (which is true in most cases including ours) then the frequencies from [-fs/2 to 0] are just a reflection of the frequencies from [0 to fs/2] and so some FFT procedures just output the FFT spectrum from [0 to fs/2], which I think applies to your case.This means that the N/2 data points that you received as output represent the frequencies in the range [0 to fs/2] so that is the bandwidth you are working with in the case of the FFT and also in the case of the STFT (the STFT is just a series of FFT's, each FFT in a STFT will give you a spectrum with data points in this band).
I would also like to point out that the STFT will most likely not reduce your computation time if your input is a varying signal such as music because in that case you will need to take perform it several times over the duration of the song for it to be of any use, it will however enable you to understand the frequency characteristics of your song much better that you would do if you just performed one FFT.
To visualise the results of an FFT you use frequency (and/or phase) spectrum plots but in order to visualise the results of an STFT you will most probably need to create a [spectrogram (hyper-link)] which is basically a graph can is made by just basically putting the individual FFT spectrums side by side.The process of creating a spectrogram can be seen in the figure below (Source: Dan Ellis - Introduction to Speech Processing).The spectrogram will show you how your signal's frequency characteristics change over time and how you interpret it will depend on what specific features you are looking to extract/detect from the audio.You might want to look at the [spectrogram (hyper-link)] wikipedia page for more information.
I'm not aware of any native STFT implementation in Julia.
In addition to consulting the [documentation for the STFT from librosa (hyper-link)], we know that the horizontal axis is the time axis while the vertical axis are the frequencies.
You can do the same for all values of t (with a different figure for each value, with a bell shifted to the left/right), and obtain the STFT.
note that, the width of the winow function is constant throughout the entire STFT process.
as i stated earlir in the function g(t-t'), t: is the current time on the time axis and it is variable for each shift of the window function and t': is the width of the window and it is constant throughout the entire STFT process.
STFT or "Short-Time Fourier Transform" uses a sliding-frame FFT to produce a 2D matrix of Frequency versus Time, often represented as a graph called a Spectrogram, like this one:
The STFT is used when you want to know at what time a particular frequency event occurs in the signal.
If you use window for FFT, your computation will be a kind of STFT.
There are some prepared codes of STFT like 'Spectrogram' etc.
The requirements are not fulfilled when the defintion of STFT is commented before the destructor of Whatever is defined since this requires the destructor for stft which in turn requires STFT to be complete.
So it seems likely that in your implementation file STFT is complete when Whatever::~Whatever() is defined but otherwise the defaulted one is created without the STFT being complete.
[http://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.signal.stft.html#scipy.signal.stft (hyper-link)]
stft func is added in the [SciPy 0.19.0 (hyper-link)], check this [post (hyper-link)] to upgrade your module to the newsest version.
libraries for STFT and other maths; SciPy and NumPy are your friends here
I don't know much about tf's inverse_stft; it seems to require a complimentary window function in order to work.
But to estimate the original waveform from its STFT without phase information, you might want to look at either the Griffin-Lim algorithm, or WaveNet vocoder conditioned on Mel spectrogram (which can be derived from linear spectrogram from STFT).
In general, a spectrogram is multiple (possibly overlapping) STFTs and the time in the plot is proportional to the time in the signal.
Plot to get STFT.
On a side note: Are there no STFT functions in MatLab?
If None, noverlap = nperseg // 2.” So STFT is not making 1e5/1e3=1e2 “segments”, it’s overlapping 1e3-long segments by 500 samples (half-a-segment), so you end up with a little more than 200 overlapped segments.
The signal.stft got a default window overlap of 50% which roughly doubles the number of the segments.
Searching "stft overlap" in google will help you to learn more about this overlapping.
So we have two single items stft and cqt, and a list feature_extract of 20 more items, and we want to produce a list with the 22 items?
That is spelled [stft, cqt] + feature_extract.
The problem is that stft returns a non-monotonic "f" vector.
librosa.stft(y) returns an array of complex numbers, as one would expect from a [Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) (hyper-link)].
@ HasanShovon the link which you provided on your comment box is actually working on STFT method or algorithm.
STFT stands for "Short time Fourier transform".
I guess you are using the stft function from [package GENEArerad (hyper-link)].
When computing an [STFT (hyper-link)], you compute the FFT for a number of short segments.
I solved this issue by bypassing PyTorch's stft implementation.
The problem stemmed from _VF.stft call in packages/torch/functional.py.
S1 and P1 contain STFT and Power Spectrum Density(PSD) of the signal for a time interval of each section with a time interval whose estimations are contained in T1.
The same technique can be used in your code which is an implementation of stft.
If needed, I can answer why the parameters for STFT are chosen as included in the code.
The T variable contains the times at which the wav file contains frequencies F with the corresponding STFT in variable S. On a logarithmic scale (for arguably better visibility of frequency content), you calculate Z=log10(abs(s));.
As you mentioned S is STFT of windowed x, and P is PSD.
Pwelch function also gives PSD and calculation method is the same with spectrogram, except doing averaging all STFT.
If you do use pwelch function in the same way with upper example you will find averaged graph of all STFT segments.
You normally generate an [STFT (hyper-link)] over a sliding window throughout your file.
an STFT is overlapped, where the adjacent segments share some overlapped data instead of just being end-to-end.
pwelch is basically the average of the squared magnitude of the STFT.
The spectrogram function returns the STFT of the signal thus it operates on the signal in the time domain.
Normally blockSizeF and blockSizeC would be the same, but in this case for every one read into a frequency subarray of STFTin, you perform two writes into separate channel subarrays of temp and tempConj.
Each STFT window can have a different complex phase depending on how the start (or middle) of the window is synchronized (or not) with the sinusoids period.
The phase of the STFT coefficients for the different windows depends on which data exactly the window "sees".
So far, both spectrogram and stft produce correct frequencies, 10, 25, 50, and 100 in the plots.
Let's store all STFT outputs in a matrix named Yb.
If multiple window lengths meet your criteria, then the shortest length that is a multiple of very small primes is likely to be the most computationally efficient for the following FFTs within an STFT computational sequence.
From [the documentation (hyper-link)], it seems the stft only accepts (..., length) inputs, it doesn't accept (..., length, channels).
And lastly, since you will already have 10 channels in the result of the stft, you don't need to expand dims in the last lambda.
Warning: I don't know if they made stft differentiable or not, the Conv1D part will only work if the gradients are defined.
The [FFT (hyper-link)] or [STFT (hyper-link)] does not produce notes like you can find them in [sheet music (hyper-link)].
The reason for this is the argument center for librosa's [stft (hyper-link)].
librosa.core.stft(y, n_fft=2048, hop_length=None, win_length=None, window='hann', center=True, dtype=, pad_mode='reflect')
By default, STFT uses reflection padding.
Calling the STFT like this
Note that librosa's stft also uses the [Hann window function (hyper-link)] by default.
If you want to avoid this and make it more like your Scipy stft implementation, call the stft with a window consisting only of ones:
However tf.contrib.signal.stft expects a (signal_count, samples) tensor as input, therefore one has to transpose it beforehand.
The shape of STFT and RMSE are different than MFCC and other features.
STFT and MFCC are 2 dimensional while the others are one dimensional features.
The time axis for an STFT spectrogram depends on two factors: the sample rate and the hop length.
When you compute the STFT, you specify hop_length=64, win_length=256.
If the data you are have is real then the data you have is most probably [spectrogram (hyper-link)] data and if the data you are receiving is complex then you most probably have raw [short time fourier transform (hyper-link)] (STFT) data (See the diagram on [this (hyper-link)] post to see how STFT/spectrogram data is produced).
Spectrogram data is produced by taking the magnitude squared of STFT data and is thus not invertible because all the phase information in the audio signal has been lost but raw STFT data is invertible so if that is what you have then you might want to look for a library that performs the inverse STFT function and try using that.
As for the question of what the FFT dimensions in your data represent, I reckon the 257 data points you are receiving every 10ms are the result of a 512 point FFT being used in the STFT process.The first sample is the 0Hz frequency and the rest of the 256 data points are one half of the FFT spectrum (the other half of the FFT data has been discarded because the input to the FFT is real and so one half of the FFT data is simply the complex conjugate of the other half).
In addition to this, I would like to point out that just because you are receiving FFT data every 10ms 121 times does not mean the audio signal is 1.21s.The STFT is usually produced by using overlapping windows so your audio signal is might be shorter than 1.21s.
You can see once the wav audio file is read into variable samples it is passed to a function called stft :
here you already have access to the audio samples in var samples in the form of integers ... be aware that bit depth will impact number of bytes per sample as represented as a series of integers ... also know your endianness (left to right or visa versa)  ... however in function stft that array is further processed into an array of floats in variable :  frames before its passed into function [np.fft.rfft (hyper-link)]
To your question: In this code the stft isn't computed by matplotlib, but just by numpy.
If you want a time step of one millisecond, then you will have to offset the window of samples you feed each STFT to center the window at that point in your sample vector.
