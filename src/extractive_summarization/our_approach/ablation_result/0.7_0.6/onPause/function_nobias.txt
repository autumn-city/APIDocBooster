onPause() is always called on your Activity if it is in the foreground when Android wants to do something else.  It may start another Activity which may result in your Activity's onStop() getting called. It may just call onResume() on your activity. It may just kill your process without calling any more of your lifecycle methods.
onPause() is called when your activity is no longer at the top of the activity stack. 
If you can still see any part of it (Activity coming to foreground either doesn't occupy the whole screen, or it is somewhat transparent), onPause() will be called. 
Whenever some new activity occurs and occupies some partial space of the Screen.  So your previously running activity is still visible to some extent. In this Case, the previously running activity is not pushed to Back Stack. So, here only onPause() method is called.
The Activity is not moved to Back Stack.
