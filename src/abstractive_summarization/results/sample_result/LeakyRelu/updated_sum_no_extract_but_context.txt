[API documentation]:
This API is <LeakyRelu> in the PyTorch library.
Function: Applies the element-wise function to facilitate the transition between the positive and negative slope. The LeakyReLu function helps in maintaining the flow of gradients back through the network, specifically with negative inputs. It has its basis in the defined function max(0, x) + negative_slope * min(0,x) further enhancing the capability of the model to learn from the negative input values.
Parameter: negative_slope (float) â€“ This parameter controls the angle of the negative slope and is a hyperparameter without predefined values. It is particularly used when the inputs are negative. Default: 1e-2; inplace (bool) - This parameter determines if the function can do the operation in-place to save memory, or create a new variable. Default: False.
Notes: The LeakyReLu function doesn't have learnable parameters like weights. It is an activation function often used in model initializations. Implementation may vary across different OS/hardware, and references with detailed usage instructions are available on Stack Overflow and other external specifications. It is crucial to understand the concept of negative_slope while using this function and knowledge of which can lead to better API performance.
