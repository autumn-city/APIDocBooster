Note that onCreate() is only invoked when the database file didn't exist so the DROP TABLE is really not needed. 
 And inside the SQLiteOpenHelper class, I will be putting a database-- I will be creating that whole structure.  There will be onCreate, there will be onUpgrade, insert query will be there, and update, delete-- all those queries will be there inside one class.  That will be the subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper class. 
Say if the old version is 2 and new version is 4, then the logic will upgrade the database from 2 to 3 and then to 4 
If old version is 3 and new version is 4, it will just run the upgrade logic for 3 to 4 
 Now I'll go down to my onCreate method, and I'll place the cursor right here before I call the ArrayAdapter code and I'll instantiate the dbhelper object.  I'll say dbhelper = new, and then I'll use my new class constructor method and I'll pass in this as the context, and then I'll get a reference to the database.  I'll call database = dbhelper.  And then I'll call a method that this class has inherited from SQLite database.  This returns a reference to the connection to the database, and I'll be able to use that connection to do things like inserting data, retrieving data, updating, and deleting.  Simply by calling the method, that will trigger the onCreate method of my database open helper class, and in turn that will create the table structure.
