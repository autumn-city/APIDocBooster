DrunkTimeLord: drunkt7Py
hofergabriel: Thanks for the 2020Unroll @7h3_h347h3n
Alfredojr_: what up ge0rge
fortuitouslover: has george ever said why he uses macos instead of linux?
Alfredojr_: george*
nrjklk: mac is the best lol
Alfredojr_: whats he working on yall
richardhearse: Mac is unix certified. It works pretty well @fortuitouslover
nrjklk: performance increaces on tinygrad i think
Alfredojr_: ok
banceman: he uses mac for his personal computer linux on work PC. I think so he won't need to deal with linux problems
DrunkTimeLord: linux is not very reliable, not very good looking, not very secure
afterworktech: @DrunkTimeLord that is false
oreo_171: @DrunkTimeLord how's life in 2010
JigglyGirls: trynetHappery / hullo everyone
lnau: try copying the "cl_mem" object?
fortuitouslover: @DrunkTimeLord i think you've never seen r/unixporn
heckingdog: @DrunkTimeLord KEKLEO
lnau: that's the handle to the opencl buffer
ImpactChats: r/unixporn is amazing lmfao
yanggangvr: I’m not a wrapper tho
DrunkTimeLord: @fortuitouslover you think george got time for ricing
BiszkopTT: AYOOOOOOOO
fortuitouslover: @DrunkTimeLord no i'm just responding to "linux does not look good"
ShaGreen_N09: sry what terminal extension does he use?
lnau: pycl buffer is itself a wrapper on cl_mem buffer
kumbuZ: @fortuitouslover you typing this impregnated me, although I'm male
fortuitouslover: also see Pop_OS. it looks really good out of the box
aaaaahta: what u been drinking geo?
richardhearse: Pop looks pretty decent
richardhearse: Manjaro too
sr1jann: george eyes game is strong..
heckingdog: I see you got a webcam?
fortuitouslover: GNOME looks good
nrjklk: what is the time complexity of a neural network?
ShaGreen_N09: he doesnt read the chat ?
richardhearse: he does
ArbitRandomUser1: everything is O(1) if you have an oracle
richardhearse: He appears to be in a flow state.
fortuitouslover: @nrjklk i think you can query the neural net in constant time? i am not sure i don't know anything about this
JigglyGirls: what's george's beverage of choice ?
gameplaystreamer24: somehow this stream makes me productive... on a sunday. I wanted to chill today george.
nrjklk: i wonder if it depends on the number of layers in the NN too
0xHSN: pure leaf tea @JigglyGirls
sibcowper: im writing a web scraper in haskell rn
sibcowper: trying to at least
richardhearse: @sibcowper How's that going?
oreo_171: @JigglyGirls sweet leaf tea
nrjklk: @sibcowper ,coool man! tell us more
richardhearse: Imposter syndrome hit yet?
fortuitouslover: @nrjklk it obviously does but the number of layers remains constant so it is O(n)
fortuitouslover: i mean O(1)^
0xHSN: @richardhearse hahaha
sibcowper: not too bad, using the scalpel library which is fairly intuitive
banceman: anyone here did sendex's neural net from scratch book?
aaaaahta: there are cans for pure leaf tea? the blue one is having rn?
fortuitouslover: @sibcowper i always thought doing practical things would be a pain in Haskell
ArbitRandomUser1: @fortuitouslover not really .. i run haskell programs to use my computer to keep me warm in winter
menta1backf1ip: Can you recommend a high-level library for PyTorch?
nrjklk: @menta1backf1ip , check out fast.ai
mucinoab: fastai
nairdabackwards: fastai
kumbuZ: that leads to something
mucinoab: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oyCUWLL_fU
nrjklk: jeremy howard is a gangsta
ryugavegeta: Were you really the bottom 5 in your class according to your rap song??
menta1backf1ip: @nrjklk I can't decide between fast.ai and Pytroch Lightning
mucinoab: @nrjklk yeah, he is
sibcowper: @fortuitouslover in my experience, it normally is - but scalpel has been pretty helpful so far
aaaaahta: what is the purpose of fast.ai? "Making neural nets uncool again" seems like a scam
nrjklk: def not a scam, everything in the fast.ai course is avalaible for free
0xHSN: the MacBook air is holding too well
fortuitouslover: @ryugavegeta i think george once mentioned he got perfect score on his math SATs
joeleonard212: why to choose fast.ai over keras for example ?
nrjklk: cant say enough good things about the fast.ai course. It's follows a programming -first approach and doesnt get bogged down in theory
heckingdog: how long does it take to get familiar with vim?
menta1backf1ip: But did you stick with fast.ai after trying out other high-level libraries or was it first choice?
aaaaahta: @nrjklk scam doesnt need to have money involved, you just need to be deceived
banceman: @heckingdog maybe a week?
fortuitouslover: @heckingdog just start using it. you'll be comfortable before you realize it
insignia_microwave: @heckingdog just dont do it I use vim and there is no point if you already use something
nrjklk: iidk, i havent used keras too much tbh, but found it too hard to do any low level things
nrjklk: plus pytorch > tensorflow
ryugavegeta: George your stream proves that you learnt skills while playing around the internet
joeleonard212: why pytorch > tensorflow ?
codingquark: I tried PyTorch the other week
banceman: @codingquark and?
codingquark: Don't yet know why it is better
codingquark: :P
nrjklk: better for experimentation, you can change graphs during execution
menta1backf1ip: @joeleonard212 pytorch is the choice for research vs tensorflow being an enterprise solution
banceman: @codingquark lol tell us when you do
Tekrific: Tensorflow is a mess. Coding by committee is a bad idea
nrjklk: also george's company uses pytorch now
codingquark: I need to find out if there's an easy way like gRPC of Tensorflow's docker to deploy pytorch
banceman: @Tekrific what do you mean?
codingquark: Karpathy was praising pytorch too
nrjklk: im a noob, i see goerge and karpathy use pytorch, i use pytorch lol
deceptionna: what's our current line count
p0rnia: @georgehotz i saw your noobs lessons on youtube I want to ask a question irrelevant to the current topic I want to improve myself about write my own algorithms and exploitation. what should I do ? should I have to learn completely how computer works or something
DieterReinert: There are plenty of options. Just use what works for you.
codingquark: I mean who are we dumbs to question the lords of deep learning
Bagofpotatoes: wow, who came up with that sweet logo on the repo?
p0rnia: @georgehotz soory for my language i am not a native speaker
ryugavegeta: Reverse of a "noob" is "boon", change your mentality
voroninman: @p0rnia I'd recommend book called Code.
nrjklk: @p0rnia , that's a great question i wonder too. hope george sees this
nrjklk: @voroninman , link pls?
p0rnia: @voroninman who is the writer of this book
p0rnia: @nrjklk i hope so
voroninman: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44882.Code
joeleonard212: I'ts not clear to me why tensorflow is an entrprise solution if geo is using pytorch on his entrpr
nrjklk: @voroninman , thanks, will check it out
joehartshorn: has anyone done sicp? i have it, just trying to figure out if it's worth digging in now or when i have a few projects done
banceman: @p0rnia learn a language (python, c, c++), do nand to tetris, do CTFs and copatitive programing until you are not learing anything new. at that point you would be good
menta1backf1ip: menta1backf1ip gifted a Tier 1 sub to nrjklk! This is their first Gift Sub in the channel!
menta1backf1ip: menta1backf1ip's Gift shared rewards to 5 others in Chat!
fortuitouslover: @p0rnia if you're completely new to programming then I'd suggest watch the CS50 course, then do some challenges like AoC. after that you can find things on reddit on how to go into specific domains
codingquark: @joehartshorn Last I was doing SICP, I was in 3rd chapter
codingquark: Haven't had time to resume
joeleonard212: I studied ML and now I'm going deeper in DL, I wanna choose the best framework to me, I used to apply keras but I do not want an high level solutiona nd anyway I need to understand why Pytorch > Tensorflow as you all say
menta1backf1ip: @nrjklk hopefully that will help you beocming a pro ;-)
Bagofpotatoes: @joehartshorn I did about half of SICP like 10 years ago. Pretty cool introduction to things like tail call optimisation etc
ryugavegeta: Even cmdchallenge is cool
joehartshorn: i just finished, cs50, loved it, hence thinking about sicp
nrjklk: @menta1backf1ip , what will?
ShinyCyril: @joehartshorn I've tried reading it a couple of times but inevitably never make it past the second chapter. Even just the first couple of chapters have improved my coding style however.
codingquark: I think SICP is amazingly good at multiple levels - engineering, introduction to programming, thinking about the art etc
fortuitouslover: i was thinking of starting SICP. do i really need to know lisp before doing it?
joehartshorn: lisp is apparently v easy to pick up
codingquark: It'll teach you Scheme as you start reading
ShinyCyril: it walks you through Scheme from the ground up
Bagofpotatoes: it's just Scheme, not Common Lisp or anything crazy
bat3man3: @georgehotz when can we see the AOC streams, saw you on the leaderboard :D
ryugavegeta: Yeah man AOC
p0rnia: @banceman @fortuitouslover thanks for your reccomendations what documents do you guys reccomend
nrjklk: i love this community around george's streams. even if he doesnt read the chat, I gettta meet cool ppl on chat lol
joehartshorn: thanks you lot, gonna give sicp a go soon i think
VirloCOD: BS CS and after MS CS or MS AI?
ryugavegeta: @nrjklk Nah he reads chat's
joeleonard212: @ryugavegeta I guess he's not replying to n00b question...but what's the level acceptable ? lol
SoNastyyy: Anyone know if George saw the 0-day published by ian beer this week?
ryugavegeta: @joeleonard212 ??
fortuitouslover: @nrjklk this is my first time actively participating in chat and i am surprised how good the community is
nrjklk: same, my first time too!
nrjklk: programmers have the least toxic communities
VirloCOD: I don’t get it how people can code and know everything without copying. AI etc. I code for years and still can’t code all out of my head but know all general knowledge of every language
voroninman: I can't follow with this font size. Does anyone follow what is going on?
playboitarty: @voroninman are you in 1080p?
voroninman: Yep.
fortuitouslover: btw @p0rnia if you're really passionate about learning this stuff long term, check out https://teachyourselfcs.com it is a really good resource. you can get to undergrad level just by following what it says
Bagofpotatoes: it's difficult for me to follow too on this 13" screen
banceman: @p0rnia what do you mean by documents?
cutza: will you have a look at AlphaFold at some point?
codingquark: I've given up on reading, 13inch screen
Bagofpotatoes: thanks :)
codingquark: Considerate George :)
codingquark: Much love
banceman: sorry @georgehotz we can't read
p0rnia: @banceman like books or something like that
deceptionna: @georgehotz what's the line count looking like
menta1backf1ip: @VirloCOD if you're not trying to memorize the complete code but rather copy paste it, what are you insteas focusing on learning?
guest1GRjBAYo: is there a link to the github repo?
mulungo: Mostly to do with resolution rather than font size
fortuitouslover: @p0rnia teachyourselfcs.com is a long list of books you can follow
banti_thakur: Hello
remegy: @VirloCOD depends how much you code
Bagofpotatoes: @menta1backf1ip I don't think you should be trying to "memorize the complete code" -- you're usually trying to learn concepts rather than specific details of APIs that might be gone tomorrow
voroninman: 👀🔎
DigDidd: everyone copies, even on this very stream, know enough to know what to google when you get stuck
playboitarty: @VirloCOD Do you use intellisense? I started retaining way more after I stopped using it.
banceman: @p0rnia I would suggest going with online resources since they are upto date and free, i recomend the https://www.nand2tetris.org/ course which has a book
JigglyGirls: im more of a hardware guy but i love george's stream trynetHappery
ryugavegeta: @fortuitouslover Cool resource
codingquark: 👁👁
remegy: if you code enough you start to remember what goes where, you'll just have to "google" the minute details
p0rnia: @fortuitouslover @banceman thanks a lot again
VirloCOD: Nah not copy paste.. I mean I know how you need to do it and what it is but sometimes I forget what to write again I know it but don’t know how to write it.
remegy: but if you code 2x week then you dont have enough exposure
Timo_Gl: is he still using the m1 mac?
VirloCOD: Like I know how to connect a db but I copy it from google fast
remegy: thats fine
banceman: @playboitarty do you think it's worth turning off intellisense?
remegy: why are you against that ?
banceman: @p0rnia you are well come man
M3talstorm: import cProfile
VirloCOD: And because of that I forget how to connect a db without copying
VirloCOD: Thats bad
remegy: why is that bad
playboitarty: @banceman 100%. It's a bit of a pain at first, but you'll find yourself googling things way less often
remegy: you'll never ever have to code on a stranded island without an internet connection
DrRobotvinnik: bro you still on the M1 chip? @georgehotz
remegy: just think of google as your 2nd brain
VirloCOD: Cause a lot of people can do it in 5 secs without copying
insignia_microwave: I found this good graph for making python fast https://imgur.com/a/f0WcKnY
VirloCOD: Like george
remegy: they cant do everything like that
printhellosailor: python can only go so fast
remegy: george copies too
zup_zup: so did you end up triggering the ANE?
0xHSN: can anyone explains how Advent of Code leaderboard works?
playboitarty: It just feels better being able to consistently code without searching. nothing wrong with googling, but I like coding fluid
banceman: @playboitarty i think i will try it
HHZstreams: sss
banceman: @0xHSN i think faster you get the flag more points
remegy: @georgehotz just to prove my point, how often did you have to google stuff whilst doing tinygrad ?
ryugavegeta: Great work Geohot
M3talstorm: @insignia_microwave What units are those?
levitate03: I love intellesense, but it can slow you down when working on large codebases because VSCode's intellesense doesn't scale well and you end up waiting for it a lot of the time
Bagofpotatoes: @0xHSN the leaderboard on AOC sucks, you have to get up at 4 or 5am GMT and solve it as quickly as possible
zup_zup: cool thanks i'll give it a read
OetziOfficial: hi
insignia_microwave: milliseconds @M3talstorm
fortuitouslover: @0xHSN you get 100 points to be the first person to solve a problem, 99 if you're the second, 98 if you're third, ... 0 if you're 100th or more
DrRobotvinnik: still a hacker at heart cbrahFeels @georgehotz
insignia_microwave: I think
ryugavegeta: George why do you choos tomcr00se as your handle?
M3talstorm: @insignia_microwave It doesn't take 3.9ms to read a local var
Bagofpotatoes: 1 point for >=100th place, not 0
oreo_171: !uptime
menta1backf1ip: Who wants a sub?
fortuitouslover: AoC is mostly just a typing test. at least till now
remegy: @ryugavegeta he likes tom cruise
Bagofpotatoes: every time I do AOC, I get 1 point for each problem because I don't wake up at 4am :D
patrickgekko: sub pls x
oreo_171: @menta1backf1ip me
insignia_microwave: https://imgur.com/a/f0WcKnY @georgehotz have you seen this table for how fast operations in python take
VirloCOD: I just want to learn AI/Deep learning etc. And don’t know if I should do MS AI or BS AI or just BS CS and MS CS
banceman: @remegy i agree googling is not bad, but googling the same thing over and over again is a waste of time right.
fortuitouslover: @Bagofpotatoes you get one star. i think that's not equal to one point
0xHSN: @fortuitouslover so should i solve the previous problems? or start from this midnight? i mean does solving the previous one gives me something?
blinter121: @georgehotz what are you currently using for hardware ?
fortuitouslover: if you see in personal stats, it'll show zero score
remegy: ofc if you dont understand how to do a for loop after 5 googles then you're not learning @banceman
printhellosailor: I thought AOC was a really ignorant politician... shows how much I know
remegy: AOC = Advent of Code lol
menta1backf1ip: menta1backf1ip gifted a Tier 1 sub to oreo_171! They have given 2 Gift Subs in the channel!
gunmanhell: love the concrete
menta1backf1ip: menta1backf1ip's Gift shared rewards to 5 others in Chat!
playboitarty: chair pog
lilmarsh17: Kappa
OetziOfficial: Thanks for the 2020Surprise @menta1backf1ip
oreo_171: @menta1backf1ip Thanks buddyfor the gift sub!
fortuitouslover: @0xHSN you get stars if you solve it in <= 24 hours. im not sure if you get stars after that.
insignia_microwave: https://imgur.com/a/f0WcKnY @georgehotz have you seen this table for how fast operations in python take?
printhellosailor: if tinygrad is so small, why not rewrite it in a faster language which outputs efficient machine code?
Bagofpotatoes: @fortuitouslover ah, interesting. you're better off joining a private leaderboard for AOC, anyway
fortuitouslover: and anyway if you're not in the top 100 in AoC, being fast really doesn't mean anything. you can take as much time as you want after that
menta1backf1ip: Youre welcome @oreo_171 ;)
DrRobotvinnik: what juice are you endorsing today? @georgehotz
gunmanhell: ur house looks like Blade Runner or Heat
remegy: @georgehotz you should drink some GFuel
ELEMENTiQ1337: Eggs Pog
playboitarty: cooking stream??
Eng1neerWho: this guy have a really good live stream
VirloCOD: Python vs Java?
M3talstorm: Ye the slowness doesnt come from Python, just the crappy code Kappa LUL
leesingods: Just made some french toast want some?
menta1backf1ip: @remegy obvsly green tea with pasta
VirloCOD: C++ faster tho
RobinMalfait: @fortuitouslover you still get stars even if you do aoc of 2016 now. But yeah first 100 people get points/score
Luiferreira: Hey! Cheers from Brazil! U inspire me
fortuitouslover: @RobinMalfait thanks i didnt know that
insignia_microwave: @VirloCOD C++ takes 10 x longer to make the thing tho
eta002: Iceland!! greetings
remegy: @VirloCOD oh look hes googling xD
marcelbischoff: you can call the gc
fortuitouslover: GeeksForGeeks ewww
VirloCOD: @remegy 😂😂
winsomehax: Spend months writing spaghetti code in C++ just find out that you get a 0.0001% speed up because all the time is spent in the GPU calcing tensors.
M3talstorm: __del__ is when the GC cleans it up, which can be at random times (not just when the ref counter gets to 0)
sibcowper: @fortuitouslover are you above GeeksForGeeks?
HydroponicGarden: there is 25 billions computers in internet. If one computer will emulate 10 neurons we get 250 billions neurons which is 10 times more than neocortex. It would be huge AI network isn't it?
VirloCOD: C++ is eZ
Bagofpotatoes: I have 12 stars so far in this AOC, but I can't even see my score, so I assume that's zero :P
remegy: yes @HydroponicGarden that is exactly correct
playboitarty: Imagine voluntarily signing up to a botnet lol
fortuitouslover: @sibcowper G4G has poorly written articles and poorly written examples
marcelbischoff: slower or more mem?
marcelbischoff: I think the gc
fortuitouslover: @Bagofpotatoes go to leaderboard -> personal stats
printhellosailor: C++ isn't that bad, but it isn't great either... I'm looking forward to Jai being released so I can use C++ a whole lot less
UltraScientism: maybe we should make our ML frameworks on non-slow languages?
winsomehax: isn't there a profiler to tell you were all the time is spent?
oreo_171: @printhellosailor is it supposed to be better than julia?
remegy: @printhellosailor when is jai coming out ?
HydroponicGarden: @remegy So why nobody writes some distributed software for this yet?
M3talstorm: @winsomehax Theres also one for mem as well :)
insignia_microwave: @UltraScientism Python is not that slow though. as long as you dont write shit code
printhellosailor: @oreo_171 Julia is a different beast, can't really compare it to C or C++
VirloCOD: Python is good for AI/algorithms etc. But Java algorithms/programs/apps/websites etc. So what is better to main?
Bagofpotatoes: @fortuitouslover wow... I woke up pretty early this morning for day 6, but still not fast enough: time 00:50:31 , rank 9580 score 0
printhellosailor: @remegy hopefully within months, but probably sometime next year
remegy: rip
printhellosailor: the close beta is being expanded soon
mucinoab: Whats the screen flash?
Bagofpotatoes: I bet you have to solve both parts within the first like 3 minutes, to have any chance of top 100
FukurOwI: @mucinoab ctrl + s
remegy: I hope its legit, C++ really needs an update in terms of ease of use
M3talstorm: @VirloCOD Java for websites, not really anymore
remegy: its so powerful but so many n00bs are scared of it
printhellosailor: you could probably find someone with beta access for an invite sometime in the next few months if you really want to start using Jai early
fortuitouslover: @Bagofpotatoes i did really badly too. rank 2300 something
oreo_171: @printhellosailor i meant like is Jai that joke, like to solve problems with x we now have x + 1 languages
metasolid: @georgehotz hey man you're currently 25th in aoc leaderboard. what do u think about it?
k0pernicus: Hi everyone!
banceman: hi
alycia: wassup !!
I_am_paranoid: @mucinoab it's a beep sound in terminal
printhellosailor: @oreo_171 it's quite different from other languages - all languages are about trade offs, and you should be choosing the language that works best for what you need
k0pernicus: Based on the fans noise, Georges is not on the MacBook Air M1 anymore... :D
oreo_171: @printhellosailor i agree
Nnotm: is it cee-far or cye-far?
remegy: isnt that the same name ?
Bagofpotatoes: @fortuitouslover the competitor pool will probably whittle down as the challenges get harder... last time I gave up after maybe 10 days with the Intcode stuff, although it seems easier this year
toomuchh: is it true george you suck the juice from tea bags?
VirloCOD: @remegy ye more for programs but still backend. Companies want Java developers but Python is better for ai etc. So lmao
printhellosailor: while there are some things I'm not a huge fan of, it does a whole lot much better than all other languages, at least as far as a C/C++ replacement goes
Zepcon7: Is he still on M1 MacBook air?
joehartshorn: ya
fortuitouslover: @Bagofpotatoes this is my first time doing it. till now the hardest part of every problem is taking input
k0pernicus: Don’t think so based on fans noise @zepcon7
joehartshorn: he said he was earlier
Bagofpotatoes: @fortuitouslover agreed... I'm doing it in Haskell and have to keep copy/pasting the code I wrote for splitting records with a double newline
Zepcon7: @k0pernicus thats what I thought
Bagofpotatoes: the day 4 parser was horrible
leesingods: big brain
leesingods: moves
Piqcyl: what is he working on atm
fortuitouslover: @Bagofpotatoes day 4 part 2 was torture
marcelbischoff: that GPU=None stuff broke something for me too
gent03: @georgehotz what’s your iq??
inkblotgaming_: Code go brrr
Piqcyl: @gent03 50
VirloCOD: Lol I have a Macbook pro i9 32gb ram but also a the fastest desktop, what is better to code on?
andrewfashion: You’re such a gangster
andrewfashion: :)
marcelbischoff: I meant before it broke .cpu() but you already merged my PR
menta1backf1ip: @gent03 he's in the above 125 club
HydroponicGarden: @gent03 unmeasurable
WarrenBt: Hey Georges, what do you think about Elon saying they'll ship fsd level 5 by next year ? said it on axel spring interview
k0pernicus: @virlocod there is no perfect laptop to code on... take a laptop with at least 4Gb of RAM, install whatever you want and go on :)
oreo_171: @VirloCOD rumoured M1X macbook pro 16 LUL
VirloCOD: MacOS > Ubuntu in Win vm?
nrjklk: geroge's prediction is realy FSD by 2029
fpsjuicestus: what vi color scheme is that
winsomehax: Deliver on it. Don't say you will do it.
fortuitouslover: @fpsjuicestus looks like wombat256
banceman: @WarrenBt elon is saying level 5 next year for the last 3 years i think, he's a bit too optimistic i think
Piqcyl: @banceman level 5 what
banceman: driving
nrjklk: 3 elon years
Piqcyl: ah
remegy: super mario
VirloCOD: A lot of people code in a Linux vm on windows or just macbook so lmao
Zepcon7: Looks like today is the first day where he is not in leaderboard on adventofcode
WarrenBt: @banceman haha, true
nrjklk: random question, anyone else stream here?
fortuitouslover: @VirloCOD i code in Linux VM on windows :(
remegy: btw why do people hate on elon being too optimistic ?
oreo_171: @Zepcon7 isn't he like top 25?
nrjklk: especially programming stuff
remegy: do yall have bets on when X tech comes out or something ?
winsomehax: google for driving automation levels
VirloCOD: @fortuitouslover why is that :(
banceman: @fortuitouslover why tho? WSL 2 ?
WarrenBt: WarrenBt subscribed with Prime.
fortuitouslover: i tried WSL (and WSL 2) for some time and it kept breaking. i had to reinstall WSL three times
Zepcon7: @oreo_171 yeah in general, but not in leaderboard for day 6
banceman: @remegy no hate
fortuitouslover: also, i get near native speeds on my VM. the only problem i face is playing videos
banceman: @fortuitouslover right
fortuitouslover: i basically live in my VM. i only switch to host windows while playing videos/games
printhellosailor: I use quite a few languages regularly, but I've barely used python in the last decade, apart from when I'm forced to - tinygrad seems nice though, and I may use it in the near future
nrjklk: @printhellosailor what do you use?
nrjklk: gc = garbage collection?
remegy: @fortuitouslover what VM do you use ?
famousdex: cool stream dude but can you jailbreak an iphone?
remegy: ^
VirloCOD: @fortuitouslover and why just not full windows?😂
gtnftw: I think in his words, he was using it as garbage *collector* but yes
winsomehax: Python is an infuriating language. It's good for scripting, but horrible for trying to write larger software.
nrjklk: lol
nrjklk: @gtnftw thx
Bagofpotatoes: @fortuitouslover pretty smart... the main thing I'm missing in Ubuntu is game compat. Some things work with Steam's Proton or Wine, but a lot of stuff is badly broken
fortuitouslover: what python version is required for tinygrad? i have python 3.9 and i can't install torch
iluxx182: No Pokemon Card opening here?
remegy: ^

printhellosailor: @nrjklk I use Ruby instead of Python, since it's better in basically every way (apart library support for things like scientific and machine learning), then I also work with a bunch of other languages regularly, such as C, C++, C#, JS/TS, and lower level work with the bytecode of various runtimes, and ASM; also various other random languages less regularly
panadoma: Do you think quantum computers will make all programmes redundant
gtnftw: Dart is my newest favorite language
banceman: @panadoma no
boostedcats: gpu test is coming Kappa
leesingods: GC more like EZ
Bagofpotatoes: @panadoma no, why? it'll make a lot of cryptography methods useless, but we'll still need programs as much as ever
quickcheck: Nicely done
panadoma: it will be a different form of programming would it not?
Bagofpotatoes: yeah, for quantum algorithms. But quantum computers very likely won't replace the standard model, at least in the foreseeable future
Bagofpotatoes: they're useful for solving specific optimisation problems, but not for writing a text editor or web browser
panadoma: I hope so, I have dedicated my life to learning programming
bebytesback: @panadoma you should read Scott's blog https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/
fortuitouslover: apparently torch 1.6 supports <= python 3.8 but i have python 3.9. will i have to downgrade or is there another way?
j0sheezy: just call chuck norris for all your questions and concerns
panadoma: @bebytesback cheers brother
2_am: howdy @chat & @georgehotz
leesingods: leaky gc
gtnftw: leaky leakerson
codingquark: I have watched George's talk Hacking the Simulation talk multiple times. Last night I was wondering if we could think of quantum mechanics as those hacks
bebytesback: @panadoma there is very few applications that we know of that would benefit from QC
notjacktall: Yo fix the pipes
joehartshorn: he leak too big for he damn code
printhellosailor: no one likes a leaky tensor
bebytesback: Most applications would be as fast with a classical computer.
banceman: @codingquark do you study quantum mechanics?
codingquark: @banceman yes, self-study that is.
TwitchJerball: finally get to catch one of george's streams live
gtnftw: still leaking, but leaking less?
banceman: @codingquark ahh how well do you know it?
printhellosailor: people don't realize how fast classical computers are, because most languages and most software is so inefficient that it makes really poor use of the hardware
WMjoga: vs code >
WMjoga: LUL
hrfoukin: tensorflow > pytorch
codingquark: @banceman not entirely sure. Understanding how multi-qubit systems work...
banceman: right
alamender: LUL > VScode
alamender: vim > god
codingquark: I haven't written an app for it yet! :P
RichyK1: anyone else watching this thinking they will somehow become smarter ?
bebytesback: @printhellosailor this is mostly do to people lack of understanding where the bottleneck is, and that is data, so something like row hammer would be great so we can compute in memory instead of having to move it into the CPU.
Bagofpotatoes: @bebytesback not to mention people building tiny desktop apps with Electron and NodeJS with a million library dependencies
codingquark: Do you mean execute ops in memory? I don't know how to do that. Perhaps you mean avoid using l1/l2/l3 cache
gallerdude: gallerdude subscribed at Tier 1.
iluxx182: Is my understanding right, that quantum computer could have its strenghts e.g. in prime factoring in comparison to classic cpu?
joehartshorn: was i the first lex fridman that george said build something in assembly to understand the benefits of C?
FreshHummus: monkaS
jrozner: What does row hammer have to do with computing? How do you plan to execute code in memory without a CPU?
codingquark: @joehartshorn second
printhellosailor: @bebytesback indeed, you need to have a good understanding of how your high level code is transformed through all layers all the way down to x64 instructions, and also understand the crazy complex modern hardware so you can ensure the instructions are crafted to take advantage of it
Koduck007: cops monkaS
afterworktech: Can we push over 3000 stars on https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad. Go star tinygrad!
chelsiquixote: do you play fall guys george?
Crocodillian: Y not EMACS?
printhellosailor: with high level languages, byte code and JITs, that's a lot for most people to understand and account for
kektobiologist: simping a millionaire weirdchamp
scorpion1n: you're working from home or office or home-office ? ^^
bebytesback: Row hammer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row_hammer is only for DRAM, but it brings forward a big idea, when it comes to thinking about where the compute should happens.
Crocodillian: love the industrial concrete look of the apartment
gallerdude: you have the best programming vids on YouTube
scorpion1n: Tensor as in tensorflow ?
henistein: Has anyone already asked him about AOC 2020?
jrozner: Rowhammer has nothing to do with computation
bigie: did you get ANE support on tinygrad?
printhellosailor: @henistein he doesn't like politics Kappa
marcelbischoff: my guess is mean() is pretty hacky
joehartshorn: I watched the unboxing macbook thing lol, does anyone who where alex got that wall light? the one that looks like a Turrell...

Vjasal: edit html so you have it
leesingods: Her Ego must be huge
marcelbischoff: My guess is mean()
fortuitouslover: which version of python is he using?
banceman: i think 3.7
banceman: or 3.8 idk
fortuitouslover: no wonder tinygrad doesn't work on 3.9
fortuitouslover: torch 1.6 is not only available till 3.8
0xb1: !settings
fortuitouslover: i'll have to downgrade :(
0xb1: !syntx
0xb1: !syntax
marcelbischoff: tinygrad works on 3.9
anjello_: what are we building today?
Bagofpotatoes: pyenv FTW
fortuitouslover: @marcelbischoff i can't install torch 1.6
banceman: @anjello_ he's making tinygrand run on ANE
marcelbischoff: but torch is just for the tests
rypsycle: guys sorry if it is trash question... is .. is this vim?
banceman: yes
marcelbischoff: vim
rypsycle: tgx
rypsycle: thx
fortuitouslover: yeah maybe i should just leave tests
fortuitouslover: @marcelbischoff are you assistant professor of mathematics at Ohio University?
bigie: are you stuck at the backward pass for a specific layer ?
0xb1: guys what do you think about macbook for programming ?
rypsycle: should be great
Stegosaurian: I heard George can plug USB drives on the first try
codingquark: It's a Turing machine, as good as any other
banceman: @0xb1 you can program on any computer. mac is no different
Bagofpotatoes: @codingquark there are of course, practical concerns beyond whether something is a Turing machine :P
Bagofpotatoes: plus I guess we don't really have Turing machines because they have infinite tape
advitameternam85: @georgehotz Hi george, can you give me advice to improve my programming skills in python ?
codingquark: @Bagofpotatoes I'm sure those are irrelevant in theory
codingquark: :P
printhellosailor: @advitameternam85 write more code
Bagofpotatoes: :D
advitameternam85: @printhellosailor yes, so i need to made a lot of code.
advitameternam85: @printhellosailor thanks for the advice my friend
banceman: @advitameternam85 write code, read docs
codingquark: Can this be a pickup line - "I want to make code with you"
advitameternam85: thanks guys, i appreciate it
afterworktech: @advitameternam85 watch lex podcast with George and you will get the same answer as @printhellosailor said
printhellosailor: @advitameternam85 find a project that you really would like to see happen and work on making it happen little by little
bigie: deep walk for GNNs ?
k0pernicus: @advitameternam85 read code also... sometimes, read code is much more informative than writing the same thing everytime ;)
joehartshorn: do sicp and get hench
joehartshorn: ha
advitameternam85: yes, sometimes i have more information when i read some code
codingquark: I did not realise there's a room there

fumonaut: just you
afterworktech: @banceman refresh
Bagofpotatoes: change the resolution and back
banceman: yes watching at 160p now
marcelbischoff: Hey george I have this in a branch

0xHSN: update your chrome
nooni_99: wow, first time I catch him streaming
0xHSN: looks like you're using safari too much these days
marcelbischoff: if you want to get the parameters for efficinentnet
SHAVEYY_: geo update your chrome ur gonna get hacked!!!
codingquark: May be his Chrome is a honeypot
nooni_99: @shaveyy_ why?
SHAVEYY_: he gonna get hacked bro
nooni_99: ?
afterworktech: @georgehotz see @marcelbischoff post here other than that just noise in the chat...
advitameternam85: @fortuitouslover thanks for the resource
Bagofpotatoes: @SHAVEYY_ how do you know he needs to update his Chrome? I don't see a version number onscreen
I_am_paranoid: @marcelbischoff just make PR
codingquark: Higher chances of him looking at the PR than the chat?
HydroponicGarden: @Bagofpotatoes he hacked it
marcelbischoff: @I_am_paranoid was too hacky
Bagofpotatoes: @HydroponicGarden explain...
afterworktech: where there is an update available on chrome you see the icon on top right that is needs update
bigie: this is all for getting a dynamic graph, right?
caster64o: i love watching you code george :)
sufiblues: can i ask any question or does it have to be about tinygrad
printhellosailor: @afterworktech you mean chrome isn't supposed to always have that? Kappa
kenqzzzz: !setup
schmave13: hey @georgehotz hey chat, which is the best programming language to begin with?
fortuitouslover: C
sufiblues: C
oldrop: @schmave13 c
SHAVEYY_: C
TomatoePasta: Python
FargioFarmani: Haskell
banceman: c,c++,python
Nabs__S: c
printhellosailor: @schmave13 depends on what kind of work you want to do, when starting and in the future
banceman: start with lolcode
Aedroth: I say Python but I'm biased
I_am_paranoid: damn just google and choose one
marcelbischoff: yeah I hardcoded the parameters for efficientnet, that was really stupid. That seems more elegant
SHAVEYY_: @banceman lolcode is the best
jrozner: Lolcode is the one true language
caster64o: SeemsGood
anjello_: brainfuck
pxlluu: pxlluu subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months!
FargioFarmani: @marcelbischoff Please don't be so harsh on you, you did excellent work.
schmave13: thanks guys <3
sufiblues: @georgehotz For real time application why is it considered bad practice to allocate variable on the stack vs heap.
marcelbischoff: It doesn't learn
Bagofpotatoes: @sufiblues is that a homework question?
Idanbotbol: lol
marcelbischoff: I have the analogue code in torch and it works well
sufiblues: @Bagofpotatoes no
marcelbischoff: I am freezing them
xrooohh: Kappa
FargioFarmani: Twitchies will recognize Alex on the street.
fortuitouslover: i have zero knowledge of machine learning and want to get into it but i have a question: how much of machine learning is just tweaking parameters and stuff?
printhellosailor: why u no learn? 😠
sufiblues: just curious, since i saw job blow shitting on the stack but i couldnt find the full context of hte clip
jrozner: It’s not bad or good to allocate on the stack vs heap. It depends on the lifetime you need it and whether you know at compile time how much space you need
marcelbischoff: an load the imagenet weights, that what they do in the tensorflow tutorial so it should work
Deray22: I’m doing some messing around w/ 2nd order optimizers rn.. seems promising
iluxx182: Is there a benchmark task to measure optimization performance?
sufiblues: @jrozner is there any peformance issues when taking into account cache lines? or does it work like any other place in memory?
printhellosailor: @jrozner there are more factors to take into account, such as the cache
FargioFarmani: There are many functions used to benchmark your optimization algorithm. Why not consult https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_functions_for_optimization for that matter? @iluxx182
IbisGaming: @Deray22 I am 12 universes ahead of you by using 4th order optimization to optimize my 2nd order optimizers.
marcelbischoff: SGD did work for me
iluxx182: @FargioFarmani I was thinking about a specific one for tinygrad
printhellosailor: @sufiblues if you don't bloat the stack, you can be sure it's likely to always be in the cache, which you can't say for cache lines on the heap unless you are hitting them insanely frequently
Xaotic: !help
FargioFarmani: Trying tinygrad on these functions is possible.
MorningScifi: How's that M1 chip treating you?
iluxx182: Ok thanks ;)
PrinceArthur: dougHorn dougHorn dougHorn
MrVitoDayz: Hey folks
marcelbischoff: If you load the imagenet weights it should work with the batchnorms completely frozen, shouldn't it?
marcelbischoff: if they have no gradient they should not be updated
madebyollin: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/optim/sgd.py#L95 if p.grad is None: continue
marcelbischoff: you should not pass it
MrVitoDayz: ignore it
Wopahopa: you shall not pass
bigie: I remember i used to check for tensor.requires_grad to make sure my computation graph wasn't cut. It might not do anything
marcelbischoff: get_parameters should not pass the weights without gradiendt, should it?
madebyollin: just skip them in step()
tatted_Schnitzel: what are we doing?
tatted_Schnitzel: tatted_Schnitzel subscribed with Prime.
FargioFarmani: The optimizer will skip all parameters with a None gradient
marcelbischoff: So in torch param.requires_grad = False will ignore them
banceman: can't use nn.Module.zero_grad() ?
marcelbischoff: ... had to google this ;)
madebyollin: requires_grad == True == True == True
samaritanss: he doesnt read the chat
kubectl: what was the bug?

banceman: 2:14:33 is uptime
TheGoatPrince: oh so like when the file saves or something?
bezalell: what software is it, that lets u snap the winodows like that on a mac?
banceman: when you hit end of line and try to move more it will flash and make sounds @TheGoatPrince

icuboy: go slow im trying to understand
fortuitouslover: @mero_1181 suckless sucks
banceman: @tonystargg yeah it has some data collection
Bagofpotatoes: @georgehotz you can just use "open " from the shell to open it in your browser
mero_1181: @fortuitouslover Yeahhhh
clamsino: is this hackign
mero_1181: Gotta say you are right
Denis0109: @tonystargg yes of course, you can research
mexeroserisback: IsThISHaCKNig?
mero_1181: But I am forcing myself to stick to it
fortuitouslover: it's not even minimalism it's just stupidity
Bagofpotatoes: yeah suckless sucks. I used it for a few weeks and it was like driving a car with no doors or suspension. Yeah you can get to the destination, but it's not comfortable.
iluxx182: Excel will be Turing complete
clamsino: this is hacking
Bagofpotatoes: it's like wearing a garter of thorns or something
fortuitouslover: no one needs a "minimal" terminal. all modern computers can handle any terminal
fortuitouslover: also the patching bullshit for simple functionality is a pain
itsxaos: did george move into a warehouse chat?
fortuitouslover: how can a terminal emulator not have scrolling built into it?
mero_1181: @fortuitouslover what are you using instead?
Denis0109: suckless is like SPENDING hours into not being productive and setting some bullshit Fonts for Terminal lol
clamsino: it's been a warehouse the whole time
Bagofpotatoes: yeah recompiling the shell just to avoid the overhead of loading a conf file... seems like it's not solving a real problem
printhellosailor: @itsxaos it's not his place
sangor: itsxaos nah, he's in prison Kappa
entroqy: stackoverflow mfs are responsible for the creation of the modern world

Denis0109: @tekrific yea snapstore is shit
Bagofpotatoes: dmenu is pretty nice though
entroqy: damn
Denis0109: dmenu is simple and does not need configuration
Bagofpotatoes: @joehartshorn ah, I'd forgotten the word, thanks :D I think it was in the Da Vinci Code...
clamsino: :( my gf said she was uncompatible with my pickle :(
fortuitouslover: dmenu is the nicest i agree. but i saw how much rofi can do out of the box and i switched immediately. also i couldn't get emojis working in dmenu
icuboy: what is he trying to do?
mero_1181: Agree on alacritty, not sure about rofi and I don’t like awesome ... using open box on my desktop
joehartshorn: ha i googled "davinci code leg thing" @Bagofpotatoes
icuboy: what is he trying to make?
Bagofpotatoes: haha, nice
banceman: @fortuitouslover luke smith has tuts on how to get emoji working
fortuitouslover: @mero_1181 fair enough. i just need tiling
Bagofpotatoes: oh yeah, emojis were partly cut off on the right side when I tried Suckless terminal. There was a Github issue or something about it and I just went "nope, why deal with this?"
JarlVonBarf: what's the point in fetching the archive on every invocation
entroqy: pickle lol
fortuitouslover: @banceman i've seen it but i couldn't get it working. i was probably doing something wrong
hrfoukin: downloading a tar file is this hard lol
mero_1181: @banceman not really useful ... once you start messing around with fonts it’s over
Denis0109: have u ever used gnome guys? I used it, and it's shitty bloated. Never ever again.
Tidusuper91: @hrfoukin Also creating it with the `tar`command. There's a cool XKCD image on that. https://xkcd.com/1168/
Bagofpotatoes: @Denis0109 no real problems with Gnome here in boring vanilla Ubuntu, and I only have 8gb RAM
tonystargg: @Denis0109 should i delete the canonical livepatch?
tonystargg: i guess yeah
itsxaos: do you want pickle.load?
clamsino: man I hate pickles
miloeu: @georgehotz math or programming
hrfoukin: @miloeu both, machine learning
hrfoukin: hes trying to build a classifier for the cifar dataset i guess
billyx3: u could answer these questions instantly with a python language server installed
banceman: @mero_1181 yeah maybe
heyimvertigo: @georgehotz why do you work here so much rather than your office?
0xHSN: show us the breakfast

Denis0109: Prof. showed that 0 equals 1
coinnealbha: them chairs are not cheap MaxLOL
banceman: this is reality tv
fortuitouslover: i read a proof of 1 + 1 = 2 in Rust
JamesHarrys: @0xHSN Duh! He's feets away from the mic, genius.
Crimpdeck: people proving 0 = 1 are usually dividing by 0 somewhere right?

JamesHarrys: danHeh
Zepcon7: How is living in NY?
brkydnc: @Crimped yes, mostly
afterworktech: phones are just so useless. can't do anything productive on them...
Denis0109: but it's like mobile first right?
magic_spoon_: Kurt Gödel’s incompleteness theorem proved that a system can’t prove its own consistency. So we can’t prove the consistency of logic using logic. In order to prove its consistence, we would need a stronger system outside of logic, which we don’t have. So even though it is true that 1+1=2, it can’t be formally proved using logic
tr0lkong: why does nobody like ceilings anymore
sureom: phones are pretty good for calling people
0xHSN: @georgehotz are you a millionaire now?

teerv: buys 4 3080 still cant afford 16 gb ram LUL
r2game: rich people will only need 4g, all cloud computing

JamesHarrys: liar, you're rich, yous tink of dollarz danKEK

viluliinaxx: .
jrcamachito: hack a ps5 :D
TomatoePasta: @JamesHarrys stop buying macs then
Denis0109: my phone has 16gb ram for virtual machines
billyx3: incompleteness is where there exists a statement that can not be proved true nor false. i.e., we can arbitrarily assign a truth/false value and the system will exhibit no contradictions
afterworktech: the Air has ram soldered so can't upgrade
JamesHarrys: @TomatoePasta Syke!
0xHSN: @JamesHarrys Yeah, you are. You're not geohot
billyx3: and we can do this, ad infinitum and the system will remain incomplete
marcelbischoff: But that Thneed stuff sounded interesting

j0sheezy: I thought I code fast but nope this is Mach Jesus level
techiedheeraj: What is the window manager he is using in mac
MrGwopz: @dequavo556 isit because you dont know coding or he is not saying what he is coding?
printhellosailor: @MrGwopz find a reasonably simple project that you want to see happen, and find a way to make it happen. use google a lot
SurfCat: MrGwopz if you want python realpython has some good free articles. Otherwise just code 4Head or you could checkout stuff on edx. Maybe even cs50 if that's what you are after.
marcelbischoff: I have a PR for this
devinokeefe: Use your powers for good and make a better twitch addbock TriHard
dequavo556: @MrGwopz i know coding but I don't work with the stuff he is working on right now
marcelbischoff: just put a PR
techiedheeraj: What is the window manager he is using in mac
dequavo556: maybe magnet
marcelbischoff: nevermind

thejuror8: @banceman Postmodernists believe truth is relative, wtf are you on about
banceman: @guhaa yeah
SurfCat: tools are preference but for python you can use pycharm free, otherwise vscode or sublime/atom
dequavo556: @MrGwopz read this book from start to finish and follow it http://ct-chess.us/pdf/py3_hard.pdf
magic_spoon_: I would recommended Sublime text, it’s simpler than others like Vscode
MrGwopz: @printhellosailor yeah best one to use thanks Kappa
joehartshorn: arcgis
billyx3: neovim + LSP
magic_spoon_: At least I have to do less troubleshooting
banceman: @thejuror8 missed the no real truth lol
dequavo556: @MrGwopz it has everything you need to learn for a beginner, from software, to the actual coding, etc.
techiedheeraj: Thanks @banceman
thejuror8: @banceman oh ok
printhellosailor: @banceman he's not actually a postmodernist, at least by the common definition - that was a joke he made
fabioitout: @printhellosailor XD
techiedheeraj: I am using spectacle
awad554: @billyx3 do you really need autocomplete though?
MrGwopz: @SurfCat Yeah i heard vscode is good
devinokeefe: I have 200$ credit for microsoft azure what should I do
deprinsvantstad: and make project so you can put them on your resume
aymen_kh: @devinokeefe give it to me
billyx3: @awad554 I need jump to definitions
devinokeefe: N OMEGALUL
dequavo556: vscode >>>>> sublime text for most uses
deprinsvantstad: even if its just a calculator or whatever
cmyuiosu: good thing about sublime is it'll open in like 0.5s lol
awad554: @billyx3 I just use good old grep (ripgrep) and jump to file, line no
SurfCat: MrGwopz It comes with a lot out of the box. Once you get comfortable with tools etc you can go to something else but that will take a bit of setup most of the time.
banceman: @printhellosailor idk he said in lex podcast he like postmodernist ways to thinking, it's kinda odd for someone doing science you know?
siriusb_79: vscode bloated
printhellosailor: @banceman it was a joke
techiedheeraj: Vim is god rest are junk
winningbigforever: vscode slows my laptop down a ton
magic_spoon_: I like that Sublime text is more simple. I guess I like simple
aymen_kh: vstrash
billyx3: @awad554 i use rg too but it isnt precise like a simple jump to which is 2 keystrokes
techiedheeraj: Vim is best
techiedheeraj: Use plugins in vim
cmyuiosu: vscode can get bloated fast if u install lots of extensions, but if u keep it in check and have a decent pc u should be fine
Crimpdeck: yeah i dont like vscode but its so general that it can be really useful
printhellosailor: @banceman he's obviously not actually a postmodernist
dequavo556: how to tell if someone is a vim user? Don't worry they'll tell you
magic_spoon_: Vim is more difficilt to learn for a beginner
SurfCat: True, I dislike vs as well. But you can't deny it lowers the entry for people who are starting out.
MrGwopz: @SurfCat i got a macbook and a gaming pc which is win10 which one would u prefer to code on? i mean i might start off coding a calculator or something simple. Any ideas?
magic_spoon_: It can get In the way of learning programming
kingf66: @georgehotz nothing better than watching you code on a sunday, with only boxer shorts on in a McDonalds. Keep up the good work!
techiedheeraj: My first editor was vim
winningbigforever: ive heard vscode is made based on chromium or smth?
awad554: The first step to learning vim is learning to close it
banceman: @printhellosailor i would like to hear what he has to say about it
techiedheeraj: It is easy
techiedheeraj: To learn
devinokeefe: @kingf66 LUL
techiedheeraj: What is difficult is blockchain
SurfCat: MrGwopz Won't really matter, especially at first. If you are going c# I would go windows though.
techiedheeraj: Solving etherium
techiedheeraj: It is far difficult than vim
billyx3: @techiedheeraj whats hard about it?
dequavo556: @winningbigforever it's made with electron yes
Nabs__S: Its actually crazy how intuitive some of the commands become in vim once you learn the basics
printhellosailor: @banceman pretty sure he'll say what I told you
Crimpdeck: @MrGwopz def the mac i think, gotta get familiar with unix-like
MrGwopz: @SurfCat which language would u prefer c+ or python?
dequavo556: Vim is amazing and I use it everyday but don't recommend vim to someone that doesn't know how to code LUL
techiedheeraj: Trying to manipulate blocks in blockchain
banceman: @Nabs__S yes you can pick it up really fast, but doesn't make you a better programmer tho :-/
magic_spoon_: Maybe you’re right. But with idles there is still less to learn than vim. I don’t know if that’s necceobetter
billyx3: @techiedheeraj blockchain is immutable though Kappa
kingf66: Blockchain is just another word for SQL Servers
awad554: lol frames dropping when he launches the training KEKW
SurfCat: MrGwopz as a starter python for sure. So much use and nice to write
dequavo556: Using vim makes you feel like a programmer
Nabs__S: @banceman Ofc not, just makes ur workflow more efficient. Nothing about programming aptitude
MrGwopz: @Crimpdeck so which software should i use on mac? and which one is geohot using? im new to all of this so sorry for stupid questions lol
thejuror8: Accuracy be like -^-_----^-⁻⁻⁻-----___--_-_-_-
cmyuiosu: u really don't need to worry about what ur using too much
ahahaitslit: he's using vim
kingf66: Feeling Vim Makes you a programmer
banceman: @MrGwopz start with spider or idel
dequavo556: Why does george not use any autocomplete plugins with vim?
techiedheeraj: Yeah but you can create blocks on top of existing block at the same level and manipulate the next top blocks
Crimpdeck: @MrGwopz any text editor will do. you'll compile with command line usually
joehartshorn: use solidworks its great
thejuror8: What's his architecture rn? Just two CNN layers?
banceman: @dequavo556 blot i think
techiedheeraj: @dequavo556 because he types faster than autocomplete
thejuror8: And a MLP ?
kingf66: Yes the best Text Editor is for sure Microsoft Word
devinokeefe: print f god PogChamp
Nabs__S: feel like IDEs give bad habits
MrGwopz: @Crimpdeck ok thanks
dequavo556: When you become too fast for autocomplete PogChamp
magic_spoon_: If you want to program like George bots, go on your Mac, open up terminal, type in vimtutor and go through that
PrimeLogik: @georgehotz what is better first language C or C++?
thejuror8: C
cmyuiosu: c++ builds on c
techiedheeraj: @primelogik Python 😀😀😀
banceman: @PrimeLogik c
dequavo556: C++
kingf66: C++ it has more +
deprinsvantstad: turbopascal
cmyuiosu: so, start with c then learn c++ once you learn the basics
dequavo556: but python is definitely the best first language
winningbigforever: is vimtutor good for getting muscle memory with vim
cxovrika: Assembly
marcelbischoff: is that efficientnet?
banceman: guys learn lolcode it has best jobs
marcelbischoff: what's the BS?
kingf66: IF YOU CANT PROGRAMM IN ASSEMBLY WHY EVEN BOTHER
dequavo556: Assembly is the best first language
cmyuiosu: lol
techiedheeraj: Python is for noobs
magic_spoon_: Learn binary
winningbigforever: isnt there the potential for c to scare off new people from programming
joehartshorn: HA

PetFoodGuy: chat. I bought a new couch. It's going to take 4 months. Something about production back orders in the furniture industry. Kind of nuts.
PrimeLogik: @banceman what is the reason to hack it?
techiedheeraj: Languages are just medium, if you don’t know what to code find problems first
banceman: @PrimeLogik for fun, to use the ANE
banceman: @georgehotz why are you a post modernist? what makes you think there is real truth?
devinokeefe: If you don't code in terminal with black and green theme, in Assembly with vim, lack of social life and friends, are you really a programmer?
marcelbischoff: So it seems that the M1 is faster than then a 'Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB

hrfoukin: describe neural nets using only wrong answers
xxxelent: a network of nodes connected in some way described with a tensor that have associated weights designed to take input data and characterize it in a meaningful way to generate an output, usually a prediction or some sort of processed effect. They call me google :) .
thejuror8: @awad554 Batch Norm is just an extra layer, it doesn't make anything harder to parallelize. It just makes training slightly slower

menta1backf1ip: that's what's twitch's for
clamsino: do you think the machines will code themselves one day?
UltraScientism: Technically there wasn't ever a communist governments, only ruling communist parties. USSR communists were saying that they have socialism and were building towards communism.
metasolid: imagine if buzzfeed was government
iluxx182: Its all about pokempn cards
printhellosailor: @clamsino what do you think machine learning is?
dequavo556: Buzzwords to convince boomers to give you money - AI/ML, Tensorflow, LIDAR, Industry-disrupting, etc.
jrcamachito: Hack a PS5 will be better :D we need a unlock to it
xxxelent: just get rid of all the error checking ... trust me
twistedecho21: @georgehotz since you don't like to give full good answers to questions here is mine. Where or what is the best place/thing to start to learn to code. I have gotten a lot of just do something.....but what exactly is that something?
clamsino: @printhellosailor machines learning
thejuror8: @dequavo556 You forgot blockchain DansGame
ReYFoFive: Communism is an utopia which is achieved by employing socialism and working towards that. Communism is a subset of Socialism
banceman: @PetFoodGuy slef driving cars PWED by Ai + block CHAIN + WRITTEN in node js
OGJake: How are you liking the m1 chip?
PetFoodGuy: @thejuror8 no idea, honestly. It's actually kind of nuts.
printhellosailor: @clamsino learning to code
menta1backf1ip: question is, what's the next lidar to convince vcs to fund you?
dequavo556: Adding 'blockchain' to your business proposal = +15% funding
thejuror8: @PetFoodGuy Makes 0 sense to me lol
Kobayawaka: it printed here though
flippe31: rm -rf ane?
Crimpdeck: lidar is actually trash for everything except slow moving indoor robots
jrcamachito: Hack a PS5 will be better :D we need a unlock to it
JigglyGirls: i fucking hate my CEO for using the buzzword "industry disrupting" in every email he sends baked2head
magic_spoon_: Adding “socialism” to your business proposal = + 65%
twistedecho21: @georgehotz if you were to start over again completely on learning to code where would you start?
thejuror8: @JigglyGirls is it his signature? LUL
banceman: @JigglyGirls maybe that's what get's you paid those 2 words
dequavo556: ^^^
thejuror8: Why is this chat always filled with questions about how to learn to code
thejuror8: Just type "Python tutorial" on Google
banceman: @twistedecho21 he talked about it in lex freeman podcast
jrcamachito: Hack a PS5 will be better :D we need a unlock to it
lightb00k: hello

joehartshorn: thank you im glad you posted that a third time @jrcamachito
deprinsvantstad: im making an environmentally socialist blockchain .. give me your money
the_alchemist_27: i don't think machine wont be able to write code but replicate their written code then they will modify it according to their surrounding we human call it self learning '
xSplasher: how to use a microwave ?
lightb00k: will george do advent of code stream?
thejuror8: @awad554 Even his subscribers ask these questions sometimes
dequavo556: Hack a PS5 will be better :D we need a unlock to it
Guile212: because almost all people who are interested in learning how to code are actually too lazy to learn and instead ask how should they learn
devinokeefe: Any series xers?
SurfCat: true
thejuror8: @Guile212 Yep, exactly my thought
SurfCat: LUL
jrcamachito: When you will unlock PS5? We are needing it :D
xSplasher: thats truee and yeah thats pretty true
dequavo556: There's a lot pf people that like the idea of coding but not actually coding
winningbigforever: you learn to code by having a high enough iq
solomonspeare: is this AoC day 99 PogChamp
thejuror8: If you really want to learn you don't ask about where to start, you just do it
joehartshorn: does this stream have ps5 unlocking bots hahaha
techiedheeraj: Ps 5 or xbox ?
menta1backf1ip: @joehartshorn hahaha
devinokeefe: XBOX
banceman: if you want to learn to code - just google it and go to free code camp
awad554: We want US navy xbox controller giveaways!
techiedheeraj: Why xbox
dequavo556: @techiedheeraj pc, then ps5, then switch, then soulja boy's console, then xbox
twistedecho21: there's all these python tutorials but I don't know what to do with the info after I have watched them...it's like great I can print something with python but they don't say what to do with it
Guile212: thats up to you
Guile212: 77h
dequavo556: Read learn python 3 the hard way it's simple
jrcamachito: PS5 or Xbox, I need to know which I will buy :D
cmyuiosu: u need an idea of something to make, some sort of a simple concept
winningbigforever: @twistedecho21 check out project euler
ripper_42: refactor line 73 and 74 into 1-liner
solomonspeare: my lord is that legal ?
marcelbischoff: yes that works
captainbuttercupp: try cs50 by Harvard
banceman: @twistedecho21 do https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-7
winningbigforever: yeah list comprehension
Crimpdeck: coding is easy, ideas are hard
Guile212: all these bootcamps and stuff are there to accelerate you to a point where you can do something at the cost of important fundamentals
billyx3: write your own shell in C. You will learn almost everything you need to know about programming in 1 project
Zeevo: @twistedecho21 find something to automate. like scrape a website for information. or create a spreadsheet with info
jrcamachito: When you will unlock PS5? We are needing it :Dm
PrimeLogik: guys how is mac vs windows for coding,from your experience
devinokeefe: I love python but the one line for loops have never made sence to me
joehartshorn: has anyone on here done lambda school? and what did you think?
awad554: didn't know you could put the if clause after the for clause, I always do it the other way around
SurfCat: billyx3 just build it 4Head
thejuror8: @PrimeLogik Neither not
iluxx182: I have no problem which can be solved by coding
marcelbischoff: @twistedecho21 find a project and start working on it
Guile212: @primelogik depends but usaully both are good unless u want to be a c# dev
marcelbischoff: the only way to learn
awad554: [x if f(x) for x in y]
banceman: @PrimeLogik what you have is betten then what you can buy, when starting both are same. after 2 years mac is better
billyx3: @SurfCat building a shell is a common project for introductory systems programming courses. thats what I had to do actually
ZeeZaxean: @jrcamachito he cant get anywhere near sony stuff anymore
magic_spoon_: With python, you can look up a short pygame tutorial and use that to make projects that use graphics
twistedecho21: @zeevo ok thank you
coinnealbha: im creating a startup that uses quantum teleportation to connect with robots on the moon with an occulus headset you in?
unodosthree: might wanna use a generator instead if ur doing nothing with the list
thejuror8: No he's wrong @georgehotz
instagrab: are you making PiedPiper compression V.2
jrcamachito: When you will unlock PS5? We are needing it :D
PrimeLogik: I am gonna be C# developer
JigglyGirls: maybe pick up an arduino or a raspberry pi or an fpga board and make something practical
cmyuiosu: same as a filter
thejuror8: [x for x in y if f(x)]
thejuror8: it's the opposite
menta1backf1ip: Here's how to be a better programmer by George: https://www.twitch.tv/georgehotz/clip/ResilientSmellyWaterPeteZaroll
cmyuiosu: lmfao
deprinsvantstad: automate your home with a pi
awad554: @thejuror8 both work
jrcamachito: When you will unlock PS5? We are needing it :D
awad554: I think
SurfCat: billyx3 it's doable but things like that might be overwhelming for newbies. NOt saying you are wrong just basing it of what i've seen happen to a friend that tried coding.
devinokeefe: PS5 bots MrDestructoid
dequavo556: @jrcamachito say it 7-8 more times and he will answer
thejuror8: @awad554 Nope
thejuror8: @awad554 Only the second syntax works
billyx3: @SurfCat I agree. it's extremely hard and that's the point. Programming won't sink deep in your brain until you do something hard
awad554: @thejuror8 I swear both work haha I use [x if f(x) for x in y]
jrcamachito: When you will unlock PS5? We are needing it :D
menta1backf1ip: Sony's really tempting George into catching another case like we wouldn't notice
thejuror8: @awad554 I literally checked it on my command prompt
joehartshorn: thats clip was fantastic whoever posted it
banceman: we must protect george
SurfCat: Yeah it's a stretched out struggle sometimes, but the payout is nice billyx3
thejuror8: @awad554 [i if i>5 for i in range(10)] this is a syntax error on Python 3.5
magic_spoon_: @jrcamachito he made a deal with Sony that he would never publish hacks against any of their products if they drop charges for his ps3 hack
magic_spoon_: Which they did
diego_sr_: Yooo sup
lightb00k: yooooooooooo
devinokeefe: It was fun chillin but now it's back to the crule world that is studying for a combinatorics final

dequavo556: @jrcamachito you have to be a little more aggressive if you want him to answer
awad554: @georgehotz do you respect the 80 column limit Kappa
xSplasher: @devinokeefe why
PetFoodGuy: @cellophane11578 let's not use claymation given people literally use to take pics, move the clay, and take more pics lol
Crimpdeck: anybody else went to UCSC? trash tier, except for the senior software design project
artfuldodg3r: @jrcamachito why tf do you keep repeating yourself my guy
banceman: @awad554 why do we have 80 column limit?
thejuror8: @banceman It's just a linting rule
twistedecho21: @georgehotz when you said people pay big for 4 looping how much did you mean?
devinokeefe: @xSplasher I like python too much there is no going back for me :(
thejuror8: Nobody actually follows it
awad554: @banceman old terminals or something, ask linux kernel devs
billyx3: if you fail the test, just change the tests Kappa

dequavo556: ah
devinokeefe: Free CS degree TriHard
PetFoodGuy: Okay. let's try this again, I watched south park special on tv. Was actually funny for most of the movie, but didn't need much on the creativity side
twistedecho21: so everyone agrees start with python?
dequavo556: Coding bootcamps Kappa
dequavo556: Yes
xxxelent: and yeah the list parts are hard to parse
banceman: yes python then C
devinokeefe: Yes start with python
thejuror8: Anyone in chat published in a top ML conference this year? :)
Snowlav: start with either python or js imo veiSip
thejuror8: Statistically maybe 5 people
ToxyViper: @georgehotz why pytorch better if i started to learn ml ? ( for py-newbie ) Corgo1
PetFoodGuy: @thejuror8 congrats?
awad554: Why do you use ipython instead of python, is it just for the better traceback?
d6nielcs: meh learning a typed language makes going to something like python easier later
dequavo556: George got so frustrated with HHKB questions that he started using the default mac one
twistedecho21: I think why everyone asks what to do to start out is cause no one wants to waste their time trying to make that 6 figure income
thejuror8: @PetFoodGuy Nah I wasn't humble bragging, not my case at all
awad554: @thejuror8 are you talking about NIPS?
devinokeefe: @thejuror8 No but I did get a 112 on my artifical NN test EZ

whoisjohngalt96: whut
whoisjohngalt96: Google already has their own AI accelerator
whoisjohngalt96: TPUs
dansl0ww: @krobbn I worked with zucc's company as a contractor for just under a year... very smart people but typical american work cultue, could not get used to it
ctmnz: What if they are using code uglyfier before the compilation and you are searching for something meaningful 'as a word' with the 'strings' command. It will fail to find something right?
badsteeeeeer: so basically the m1 have 8 core 8nstead of 16?
Kawhiet: how does apple use the ane besides for computational photography?
publishcoffee: I want to convert images to strings and store them in a database to later be converted to base64 and output. Base64 is too big so how do I store it smaller? what's the best compression method? anyone?
Keyeh: jpeg
kurumuz12: delete random bytes
dansl0ww: @publishcoffee define "images", we talking jpeg/png? just store them as binary blobs
krobbn: @dansl0ww Nice, where are you based?
kurumuz12: good enough compression if you do it for %10 of the bytes
dansl0ww: @krobbn netherlands :)
kurumuz12: and humans can still understand it

afterworktech: @benhopkins95 he took 1h break

benhopkins95: @afterworktech fair my dude
whoisjohngalt96: @krobbn nice... what's the difference
whoisjohngalt96: culturally
dansl0ww: @publishcoffee then store them on disk and/or some fast key/value store (redis), and just store file reference in database
benhopkins95: @georgehotz what exactly are you coding?
afterworktech: he is reverse engineering the apple neural engine
CuckLordAndy: do you like c++
dansl0ww: @krobb yeah I guess it's sort of hit and miss too. not all employers in US are horrible. But europe is so much better for the "people"
ctmnz: @benhopkins95 he is trying to increate the lives of apple 2 mario bros from 3 to 255.
krobbn: Europe I find is less hierarchical in a sense, fresh grads get to sound their ideas more too and get to implement things. In Danish culture people don't sugarcoat things, they'll complement things and tell you what you need to improve as well. People in the US rarely give constructive criticism i've found or they try to sugar coat shit.
Ikke___: !uptime
publishcoffee: @dansl0ww I appreciate your help but I'm trying to accomplish successful database storage. No one wants to try it. They keep telling me the only way is to store as a file. But has anyone actually tried to reduce the size of the string using any new breakthrough compression methods?
publishcoffee: I can't seem to find anything, or anyone trying
dansl0ww: mandatory days off, no 50+ hour culture, less hierarch (as mentioned above), less company politics, etc
krobbn: Again depends on the companies, my dad work in engineering (oil and gas) and found it hard to work over here due to the company culture and hiearchy.

Santiago_LHC: Close to three hours @Ikke___
teayoflow: @Ikke___ 2:45:35
twistedecho21: @georgehotz just out of curiosity how many hours a week are you running your company?

thx1342: and here I was planning to sleep in a normal time tonight
darkbouls: I'm glad it looks like nonsense to him on some level too
uther20: what is he doing?
dansl0ww: @uther20 reverse engineering ANE (apple neural engine)
uther20: thanks @dansl0ww
optimaltransport: Someone needs to come up with good codestreaming tools.. maybe a wiki doc so anyone new can know what George is doing
teayoflow: yeah thats what nightbot is for
insignia_microwave: Umm you have more stars than micrograd
SaffronBrick: !whatishedoing
cmyuiosu: by quite a bit lol
optimaltransport: Oh what’s that @teayoflow
teayoflow: you can set commands like !github or !whatdoing
optimaltransport: Oh nice that’s cool
magic_spoon_: i think he is trying to get tinygrad to use ane
marcelbischoff: Any news?
optimaltransport: isn’t there a good developer api for apple neural engine?
kpence: the m1 has ane but there's no documentation on how to use it
optimaltransport: Why try to access through the backdoor?
dansl0ww: @optimaltransport yes but on a high level, he wants internals
nytherino: !uptime
optimaltransport: Oh cool cool
magic_spoon_: they have an api, but they haven't released it yet as far as i know
optimaltransport: I was actually reading a few of the parents on neural engine .. they’re available on uspto. Maybe helpful?
optimaltransport: Patents*
thx1342: how does he have all the symbols?
thx1342: is it not stripped?
optimaltransport: ohh true
thx1342: LUL
Crimpdeck: they're evil until you got a good idea of your own
Waldoqq: LOL
deep_research: i have a patent on reading patents
deep_research: and not reading them
Crimpdeck: now that's a good idea
optimaltransport: but is that patent reading reader patented?
hatsudai: booba?
thx1342: damn I didn't know rbreak was a thng
thx1342: works in gdb too
optimaltransport: is every indent another layer into the processing stack?
dansl0ww: Is there something like gdb -tui for lldb?
iluxx182: s.b. writting a SCRUM story about this project?
Crimpdeck: OMEGALUL
Crimpdeck: the second u make a scrum board it become real work
dansl0ww: @optimaltransport it's a call stack, makes it easier for him to visualize how the code is structured
iluxx182: xD
angrywhopper: what is your best advice to someone who knows syntax but is just struggling with logic. Like I am recreating the tar command and I have proper C knowledge but can't figure it out
thx1342: missing a )
Andremm2: is he back at the neuro engine again?
dansl0ww: @angrywhopper divide your problem into smaller sub-problems, and solve them one at a time
projectsuru: i've missed 4 hours wow
Crimpdeck: @angrywhopper build a prototype, then write up a high level design once you figure some stuff out, and then start writing the real thing
Crimpdeck: that too
thx1342: @angrywhopper make a first shitty version. then a second less shitty version. then a third and so on
kpence: function cannot return function type
projectsuru: it's (void*)fctname
optimaltransport: @dansl0ww thanks!!

CuckLordAndy: @projectsuru practise
spasskyyy: what are you eating?
kpence: he took a drug that gave him super powers
thx1342: he spent his time coding instead of watching twitch LUL
BenNastovski: George are you on stims
smb_once: @projectsuru how do u find out that he is so good at code?
dansl0ww: honestly the most impressive thing about george is his problem solving skills , everyone can do a bit of C++
Crimpdeck: yeah coding is the easy part
Crimpdeck: systems are harder
projectsuru: yeah it's the engineering thats hards
iluxx182: Finding interest problems is also a skill, i think
dansl0ww: very true :P
spasskyyy: what are you eating????

EdwardApollo: nice christmnas tree btw
magic_spoon_: someone got ford to interface on their fork of openpilot, i don't know if it actually drives
insignia_microwave: ay no talk about georges company here
insignia_microwave: we talk about tinygrad
insignia_microwave: and Apple Neural Engine
projectsuru: what is this guy trying to do?
cmyuiosu: wtf lol no copy
magic_spoon_: to me
insignia_microwave: Hes trying to support ANE in tinygrad
optimaltransport: ANE = apple neural engine
projectsuru: no like right right now
teayoflow: best explaination yet
Crimpdeck: hes trying to reverse engineer the neural engine to get low level access @projectsuru
insignia_microwave: oh hes trying to figure out how the whole thing works I think
Crimpdeck: yeah
optimaltransport: what we can't reverse engineer, we cannot understand
magic_spoon_: he wants tinygrad to work on it. am i wrong?
insignia_microwave: no not wront
insignia_microwave: wrong
Efernin: now we are cooking with gas
kpence: george always gets the same questions online "whats your keyboard/vimrc" "what's he doing" "do you have any advice"
optimaltransport: any ideas on how much more efficient ANE is over CPU/GPU?
responsiblah: void function
thx1342: wasn't it returning a void*?
magic_spoon_: tortino
chairman_Z: is there anyone else watching with basicially zero idea what he's doing?
thx1342: legendary ciro
chairman_Z: or what's going on?
teayoflow: i know he wants all the hex numbers to be green
chairman_Z: green=good. got it.

optimaltransport: is there a debugger for the anecompiler. maybe we could set a breakpoint?
born2kill_ftw: Can i post a link?
born2kill_ftw: Its a music for George for coding
born2kill_ftw: very calming
nytherino: changed from tmux and vim to bash and screen? Any reason?
iluxx182: pasta + spinacy, garlic rocks
cookienz: george is the debugger
born2kill_ftw: @georgehotz listen to this while you code https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_4kHxtiuML0&ab_channel=GreenredProductions-RelaxingMusic
MuscleMario: damn, hurt me
Killafuru_: D:
projectsuru: at this point of debugging sasuke would have declared vengance on the leaf
IWasnotDemi: @georgehotz do you program when you're sick?
cookienz: but i want my terminal to look like tinder
nytherino: george said the same thing about python3 LUL
darkbouls: @georgehotz what do you dislike about zsh compared to bash or something though?
MuscleMario: MuscleMario subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 5 months! sending some bucks over

zennydmt: are macs the best for development?
Ayyyy420Lmao: H1Bs
magic_spoon_: only for ios and osx maps
zennydmt: is there a way to run windows specific programs on macs?
janpoonthong: HtheB
Andremm2: @zennydmt nope
magic_spoon_: otherwise it doesnt matter too much
nytherino: being sick is like your cells debugging themselves
zennydmt: thats the only frawback imo...macs not compatible with windows programs i need
zennydmt: drawback*
nytherino: you can use bootcamp or parallels i think
Andremm2: not on the new m1
magic_spoon_: @zennydmt yes, you can use a virtual machine, or you can use boot camp to dualboot windows. i don't think either work on m1s yet. maybe there is some parallel that doe
zennydmt: and plus excel is much better than anything apple offers
shakecross: geohot is my favourite compiler
nytherino: i think i read that there is a thing like wine for linux but for the m1 machines
zennydmt: @magic_spoon_ i see thx
Ayyyy420Lmao: he's losing it
celebrimborfan123: I WAS HERE

coProof: No way he’s still going
thx1342: @MuscleMario because he's on a mac
MuscleMario: is it cuz unsigned gdb?
coProof: Is this the hacking the iPhone ai cores thingy?
magic_spoon_: its a lldb debugger for llvm, the c and c++ compiler for macs
teayoflow: the word hacking gets thrown around these days
MuscleMario: i got gdb on an older mac, works .... like poop... but i also have it on my new macbook, all good, wondering y he's using it
shakecross: gotcha
tatted_Schnitzel: what are we doing?

opsayo: what is he trying to do? got here late
GoRoutines: How can you be so casual running a competitive AI corporation?
Akshay2595: @teayoflow SeemsGood
MuscleMario: from what i gather, he's trying to get tinygrad to use Apple Neural Engine
optimaltransport: fyi for those who don't know, realloc is how you re-assign memory size to a pointer: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/c_function_realloc.htm
MuscleMario: b/c m1 chip shit
PrinceArthur: @goroutines if you know yourself, and you know the enemy, you need not fear the outcome of 100 battles
Akshay2595: Half of this stuff George says goes right over
MuscleMario: LOL
UnAlpha: when are you going to hack the simulation
Akshay2595: I get realloc its the how or why
MuscleMario: u cant just say kernel, ur mixing two domains. kernel in ML or kernel in CS?
nytherino: hey does someone know what the numbers that appeared occasionally on george's prompt where?
informalgarlic: @georgehotz yse ghidra
informalgarlic: use8
nytherino: when he used zsh
Loganshogun: What is he trying to do?
PrinceArthur: @musclemario what's the difference?
JAMESB0N9: he said they are pointers to the image 'reloc' hence the discussion on whether he said reloc or realloc
MuscleMario: kernel in ML is a function, kernel in CS is the intimate code that speak to the hw.
magic_spoon_: he said reloc
MuscleMario: lol code that intimately speaks to the hw*
y3li: @nytherino i didnt see the numbers, but perhaps the exit code? i know i have that added for my zsh prompt.
informalgarlic: ghidra. use ghidra. @georgehotz
PrinceArthur: ah ok thanks @musclemario
optimaltransport: kernels in ml are the coolest
y3li: if not that, then maybe the execution time

JAMESB0N9: he does. he prefers python
Loganshogun: What lol that 5d array
JAMESB0N9: or atleast what he stream most often. he did a c++ stream a few weeks ago
xxxelent: nested structs PogChamp
lambdaz271: oh ok thats interesting lol i thought he came from a hardware background
optimaltransport: yeah tinygrad has a bunch of opencl code in it which users c/c++
xxxelent: yeah he knows c++ hes trolling, he doesn't specialize in it though so
