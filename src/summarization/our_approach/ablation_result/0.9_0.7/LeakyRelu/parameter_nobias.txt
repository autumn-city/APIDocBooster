negative_slope in this context means the negative half of the Leaky ReLU's slope.  It is not describing a slope which is necessarily negative.
When naming kwargs it's normal to use concise terms, and here "negative slope" and "positive slope" refer to the slopes of the linear splines spanning the negative [-∞,0] and positive (0,∞] halves of the Leaky ReLU's domain.
