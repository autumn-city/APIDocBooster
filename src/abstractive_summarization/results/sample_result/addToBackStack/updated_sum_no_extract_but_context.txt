[API documentation]:
This API is <addToBackStack> in android library.
Function: Add this transaction to the back stack. This means that the transaction will be remembered after it is committed, and will reverse its operation when later popped off the stack. Though primary usage revolves around facilitating navigation within an app, it is important to remember that the addToBackStack operation works in conjunction with fragments to maintain a history of user actions. Its reversed operation can also be leveraged to implement undo actions.
Parameter: name	String: An optional name for this back stack state, or null. This parameter, while not compulsory, can be useful for back stack manipulation and identifying the state of the transaction submitted. So, its selection determines the accessibility and recognizability of the back stack state.
Notes: Unfortunately, using addToBackStack(null) in conjunction with AppCompatActivity may not yield the desired reversal effect on the transaction. It is suggested to use it within 'Activity' for proficient functionality, based on related external resources. For improper use, undesired results or even system malfunctions may occur. Other OS/hardware dependencies, security implications, and legal issues were not reported.
