 onCreate is responsible for creating your tables inside your SQLite database, and onUpgrade will be responsible for upgrading your database if you do make any changes. 
This method will not be called if youâ€™ve changed your code and relaunched in the emulator. 
After executing in first time deployment, this method will not be called onwards. 
onCreate() is called when you call getWritableDatabase() or getReadableDatabase() on the helper and the database file does not exist.  If the file is already there and the version number is the requested one, no callback such as onCreate() is invoked.
