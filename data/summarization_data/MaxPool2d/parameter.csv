" So just to summarize, the hyperparameters for pooling are f, the filter size and s, the stride, and maybe common choices of parameters might be f equals two, s equals two.  This is used quite often and this has the effect of roughly shrinking the height and width by a factor of above two, and a common chosen hyperparameters might be f equals two, s equals two, and this has the effect of shrinking the height and width of the representation by a factor of two.  I've also seen f equals three, s equals two used, and then the other hyperparameter is just like a binary bit that says, are you using max pooling or are you using average pooling. "
" If you want, you can add an extra hyperparameter for the padding although this is very, very rarely used. "
 So the number of input channels is equal to the number of output channels because pooling applies to each of your channels independently. 
"Adding padding is NOT an ""absolute must"".  Sometimes it can be useful to control the size of the output so that it is not reduced by the convolution (it can also augment the output, depending on its size and kernel size)."
" When you do max pooling, usually, you do not use any padding, although there is one exception that we'll see next week as well.  But for the most parts of max pooling, usually, it does not use any padding. "
