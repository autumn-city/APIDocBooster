IIrLiChT: he vibin tho
gal40: @plazmacsgo Maybe it's about baseline. If you look at it from a purely "coding" perspective, maybe someone who knows how to code could not know sorting, but I think a programmer is also about knowing compsci concepts.

b2kemann: there are 100 of courses online
Iliftmymousealot: imo the real metaskill a programmer needs is that he can read and knows how to use a search engine, like google, really efficiently. this is how you get good
gal40: @georgehotz Could you explain what difference exploring multiple steps makes if you only take the first action?

airinspiration_: @anguscupcake not funnier than battlefield 4
calcmath: policy is function from state space to action space

anguscupcake: bf4 is too much like cod tbh
hiredguns: +1 stop -1
byte_baron: i feel like the end product of the learning process is a way better feeling than anything you'll get from gaming but for me the learning process can be quite dry (depending on what im learning)
airinspiration_: i cant handle what you said, im out
byte_baron: and im generally a procrastinator
anguscupcake: it is. when you finish a project you've actually done something. when you finish playing video games you just wasted 4 hours
fizziblytwitching: @byte_baron but you could class gaming as learning
Iliftmymousealot: the thing about gaming is that it is designed to be fun. Where as aquiring a skills is not.
Iliftmymousealot: dopamine detox inc.
eldac_kno: is it ok to ask him slightly offtopic questions?
fizziblytwitching: Just that you're not going to really grow intellectually form gaming
fizziblytwitching: from*
byte_baron: @fizziblytwitching right but i think we all know we're going to get way more from learning stuff like programming/maths/ML than playing runescape or something
byte_baron: i think it's about moderation
norB88: @SiNNER_ontwitch yeah learning how to learn type of thing.
byte_baron: do something hard (learning) > reward self with a game
Santiago_LHC: @eldac_kno no
calcmath: gamin simulates an ideal form of learning and exploring
robonhansonem: Gaming provides all the feelings associated with accomplishment without the accomplishment. Considered dangerous.
byte_baron: ^
anguscupcake: @robonhansonem exactly
Paw_4: gaming is like working out, you don't learn anything but you gains skills and capabilities
cheesemanuchiha: is this inverted pendulum
calcmath: yes it is
anguscupcake: lol
grekler3: some of this chat = Pepega
cheesemanuchiha: thanks calc
mackinonit: you gain skill...??
DelusionalDreams: watching someone doing might achive the same result @robonhansonem
SiNNER_ontwitch: @byte_baron Im also a procrastinator. I try to follow what im passionate about and keep many irons in the fire. I bore easily. If I create multiple irons in the fire, an opportunity or breakthrough is much more likely.
eldac_kno: only delusional people think gaming helps you grow intellectually
sceptix1337: you learn to farm lol
mackinonit: what are the valuable skills you gain from basketball?
Ne0Zer0: starcraft 2 might teach you valuable skills
Santiago_LHC: So.... I'm not a farmer by playing Farmville?
anguscupcake: basketball is good cardio at least

Penguino138: @georgehotz what kind of tea?
foti_kasparov: I can learn how farming works so I can build my own weed farm
fizziblytwitching: No it's not, you do have to learn to play a game, so by definition you're learning.
mackinonit: they did that with formula 1
eldac_kno: i know it's slightly offtopic, but what do you think abot Winograd Schemas?
ogsixaxis: i learned to be a gangster from gta
sceptix1337: ksp is dope
anguscupcake: VR is the ultimate for learning to play paintball
vybster: There's an argument to be made for fun though
Ne0Zer0: racing games make it easier to practice driving
gal40: @fizziblytwitching Arguing about semantics is a waste of time.
Imuhnent: What's fun?
Iliftmymousealot: fun is a fake concept
byte_baron: @vybster right, i don't think all fun should be eradicated from your life, i think it's about a healthy balance
bravetraveller: The Witness was actually fun figuring out various patterns, recommended as a puzzle game anyway
fizziblytwitching: Except in the context
vybster: Games can be fun, even though there's no "valuable skills" to be learned
THX1342: deus ex teaches you to be woke
eldac_kno: any arguing is arguing about semantics
fizziblytwitching: Given we're training AI
anguscupcake: lol deus ex was great tho
fizziblytwitching: To play a game
fizziblytwitching: In order to test it out safely
b2kemann: everyone should play outer wilds, awesome game
robonhansonem: The tea is his secret. Never will be revealed lest we all become as him.
fizziblytwitching: To prove it's usefulness to apply to other problems
Checkmate624: Checkmate624 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
Ne0Zer0: TRUE LUL
CozyDinoKigu: It's more easy to launch a game than to think what useful skill you have to improve, and to find the best ressources to develop your skills.
Santiago_LHC: I got good at playing whatever Need for Speed game came out in 2013 or so. I didn't acquire any skills, I learned the mechanics of that one game. I didn't get better at anything else.
robonhansonem: Yes. But in general, we probably have too much fun.
anguscupcake: the best video game is where you buy a whiteboard from aliexpress and write a todo list every morning
byte_baron: @robonhansonem society as a whole?
robonhansonem: Yes.
grekler3: this chat coping so hard LUL gaming = wasting time
Paw_4: @Santiago_LHC you probably did without noticing nor knowing
Santiago_LHC: Nope
eldac_kno: do you guys think Winograd Schemas are good test for AI?
Fatmetheny: @grekler3 This
CozyDinoKigu: And video-games is epidemic, when your only friend play video games, it's hard to not play with them
Checkmate624: doing something you enjoy is never a waste of time
leftyytwo: this discussion is giving me autism
anguscupcake: u already had it bro
Klemen1337: hello
robonhansonem: Worst video games are ones like WoW. You don't even learn useless skills. Instead, they simulate skill acquisition itself with their level system. Skinner box.
eldac_kno: no game teaches you useful skills
Iliftmymousealot: gaming = bad, learning = good can I get some credit for having the opinions
fizziblytwitching: Hah, WoW got me back into programming
koreais: @CozyDinoKigu it is not i used to play sorry waste time a lot but i deciced to stop this shit and now my friends play video games and i prefer to learn sth or read good book
byte_baron: they need to condense education into an mmorpg.
robonhansonem: Most teach you useless skills. Some teach you nothing.
DragonXPolymath: 1000 of games teach you usefull skills
byte_baron: education with all those addictive mmorpg merchanics.
calcmath: value is expected reward from that state
eldac_kno: no
Santiago_LHC: There are countless different types of games. I've learned many things by playing games, mostly the same kinds of things you would learn by reading fiction.
parasite_is_a_snakee: ETH mooning ;D
Checkmate624: yeah there's a big gap between educational games and games that are fun, a gap that should be filled
anguscupcake: VR could be used to gamify learning real world skills
sorin_chebac: wtf
eldac_kno: games are not education lol
CozyDinoKigu: @koreais With whom can you share your learning progress to get a bit of motivation ?
Santiago_LHC: But getting good at a game, generally doesn't get you any useful skills
DragonXPolymath: if u learn nothing usefull, ur mindset isnt usefull
byte_baron: @Checkmate624 the thing is though, it's kind of hard to stick education into a game and keep it fun
fizziblytwitching: I started writing a WoW emu because WoW was boring
calcmath: you should sample based on past visits or elese you wont explore
eldac_kno: it like putting education in movies
alexdenewb: Hey everyone, I'm new here, this community seems pretty interesting!
eldac_kno: stupid
parasite_is_a_snakee: just hack the pentagon bro 4Head
mero_1181: Shouldn’t the policy being function of the expected value of the future states?
vybster: I'm thinking of kids developing a very visual and intuitive understanding of mechanics(physics) by playing video games
Checkmate624: @byte_baron that's very true, but compare learning in schoo. You basically never feel like you're having fun, but when you learn by yourself it can actually be enjoyable
koreais: @CozyDinoKigu yeah thats the problem I have one friends who is into programming but on the other hand you have the community on the internet
Checkmate624: it's not impossible to make learning fun
eldac_kno: why dont they just play with phyisics irl
vybster: Or anyone else developing problem solving skills by playing puzzle games - like portal etc
mero_1181: Bellman equation
DrRobotvinnik: I like this new post-COVID focused George SeemsGood
eldac_kno: there is no such thing as problem solving skills
vybster: @eldac_kno Coz that can be boring. You gotta lure them in with fun stuff first
mero_1181: That’s what you solve to find the policy at time t
Newlax: !uptime
Fatmetheny: @DrRobotvinnik Post-covid??
5GToren: whats up mate have you touched a van de graaff generator?
marckkhoury: Which paper is he reading?
CozyDinoKigu: @koreais Okey. Personnaly i only have my uni. But even my mates in uni are not very serious about getting better in programming etc . . So i feel so fcking alone
swagettiyolonaise69: no more hairdresser
robonhansonem: There is use to visualizing mathematics. Making it into a game is unlikely to do much. Tricking people into acquiring skills generally doesn't work. People generally have to want to learn to get good at something. If they want to learn, you don't need to trick them with a game. Desire to write a useful script is far better than something snazzy like Code Academy.
mero_1181: Need to solve the equation backward

mero_1181: By definition
Checkmate624: @parasite_is_a_snakee I think one solution could be that immagrants seeking asylum have a waiting period after immigration where they don't have to pay taxes, so they can find a job initially

Jannnik: tsoding Pog
engineererik: @ky0jinjaeger try out german :D
bigie: could you talk about mu0 a bit? if it doesn't have a replay buffer it takes a while to converge. it looks continuous right ? that's even harder
ravenmaster: tsodinJS RAID tsodinJS
mikey9988: German is difficult to learn
mikey9988: imo
red_plex: working on twitch chess ?
whichtom: imo pytorch is just way easier to work with than tf, way easier to read and docs are better

eldac_kno: do you think people fundemantally good or evil
whichtom: wow nice link
bigie: the only way tf is gonna beat pytorch is if this swift thing takes off. i hope it doesn't. i hate tf and swift LUL
robonhansonem: Make your own sauce.
Penguino138: You can make creamy pasta sauce with milk
PristineBanana: butter works
robonhansonem: Olive oil. Canned tomatoes. Garlic.
whichtom: isn't pytorch more popular amongst researchers tho
maxschneider96: He needs some milk
Penguino138: I mean I make mine with soymilk, any kind will work
bigie: yes but pytorch is in python and python is slow as fuck
whichtom: tf might still be used more in industry idk
jontowtruck: as someone who's contributed to tf swift.... it's not looking too great.
whichtom: ya true
smurfd0: ketchup=almost pasta sause
xeeton: also, just make sure the eggs sink in water

alabamaman02: that's better @cj1m
fireposeidoncx: do you guys think george is viewbotting?
LJRewiind: hey chat whats he doing today

norB88: What did you guys think of Wolframs "Fundamental theory"?
bigie: first one to offer a "solid" framework
mashafique: I didn't really look into it but from discussions I've seen from other physicists it's nothing that profound
whichtom: what about caffe/theano?
thejuror8: @norB88 Didn't see it, what's it about ?
whichtom: wolfram is an interesting man
bigie: tensorflow is easier to work with than caffe. the other frameworks just fell behind and no one uses them anymore
whichtom: gotcha
bigie: @norB88 i couldn't understand it past the relativity theory. i hope he's onto something
takkat14: guys, what is the article at the background?

majorawpsome: does america have a 2 party system?
whichtom: true actually, start off with sklearn
maxschneider96: Well that escalated quickly
eldac_kno: so theano sucks?
whichtom: theano is ancient
whichtom: no one uses it anymore
bigie: basic cartpole starts at the upright position. if you don't input any controls it falls down. but your loss wasn't going down too idk. i have to read up on mu0
thejuror8: Keras is a great way to start
smurfd0: the values that f_l_loss is based on, do they seem to align with what they should be or !?
thejuror8: Hard to beat
mangoxavier: Have you heard the short story called “the egg”?
majorawpsome: isn't it weird that you can still be alive with a somewhat dead brain?

ido_nvidia: @crawcraw66 where he doesnt care for the item just wanna iterate for the number of items
maxschneider96: @sceptix1337 hahaha
PeinlicherAffe: germans take over monkaS
crawcraw66: @ido_nvidia ohh ok thx

pelegogrosso: what is he doing?
TasosTheLord: PrideHi
PeinlicherAffe: 🇩🇪 7
sceptix1337: hes balancing a stick lol
whichtom: yea no point assigning an actual variable if it wont be used, so use _
grahamstephan420: subscribed at Tier 0
dontbeameme: Gg
bigie: @whichtom the main goal of openai is to find AGI
sceptix1337: using some overengineered ai stuff
ido_nvidia: yep
tessier_ashp00l: TY
whichtom: @bigie i have yet to see any good work towards it
whichtom: apart from overhyped press releases with little new work
whichtom: also renamed to 'closedai'
whichtom: openai is such a scam
bigie: their language model is pretty good. their dota thing was amazing. i don't know how it's a scam
Maw3rick: monkaS
doganigooo2: helloo
kerediax: not a scam but pretty overhyped imo
doganigooo2: what happen to covid research
gaocaandra: it died
crawcraw66: so what is the algorithm meant to do? balance that stick/
whichtom: the dota thing was kinda disingenuous b/c of how many limitations were placed on the system
gaocaandra: we are now a tree search cooperative
sceptix1337: battery number go up
whichtom: GPT-2 is interesting yea, but how they went about it leaves a bad taste in my mouth
bigie: yes but if you don't force the agent's hand in a big state space like that it won't work. same with starcraft and deepmind
god_damn: PogChamp 📈
eldac_kno: gpt 2 is defintely not future
whichtom: which is fine, just don't advertise it as solved
eldac_kno: it doesnt understand text
TasosTheLord: just fold the stick man
whichtom: Deepmind's SC2 agents are pretty bad still
sceptix1337: lmao
whichtom: when it was playing in the ladder, a lot of people found it was shit
gaocaandra: all of "machine learning" is sortof snake oil
itsPhlu: hey george
whichtom: but they still went around saying they solved it
gaocaandra: it does work
gaocaandra: but its very limited
gaocaandra: and overhyped
mangoxavier: What can I do to prevent models being built for me in order to manipulate me (IoT). Other than just blocking ads
whichtom: yea
ido_nvidia: some of it works really well tho
whichtom: incredibly overhyped
ido_nvidia: what about alpha go tho?
bigie: no one claimed they solved it. openai failed vs. pro teams. it's just the big leap from atari games
gaocaandra: but thats the context
whichtom: yea true
gaocaandra: at this point in history
god_damn: i'm not really understanding, why would he turn himslef into a pickle
whichtom: even w/ atari games, most algorithms published struggle with sparse rewards
gaocaandra: we are headed towards another winter
itsPhlu: lmfao
bigie: the people around it who didn't understand what was going on overhyped it. AI is in general overhyped bcs of it
whichtom: even this one, muzero, struggles with most which is why most algorithms don't count all of the atari games
maxschneider96: @gaocaandra I wish there were sometimes better sources to figure out which model to use
itsPhlu: lol
gaocaandra: which will go unnoticed beacus these tools altough overhyped can have a great impact in accesibility
itsPhlu: hi george
whichtom: struggles with a few sorry*
itsPhlu: hi mr hotz
itsPhlu: u kinda cute
whichtom: like montezumas revenge and pitfall
sceptix1337: is this reinforcement learning
eldac_kno: GPT 2 doesnt "understand" text
itsPhlu: just use a bypass 3+
gaocaandra: because
ido_nvidia: yes
whichtom: alphago is cool ye I'll admit
PythonNoob: what is hes leyboard ?
gaocaandra: these algorithms are learning a function thet describes the statiscal distribution of a LIMITED dataset
itsPhlu: !
gaocaandra: thats inherently limited
cybergenik: @georgehotz what kb do you use?
itsPhlu: !kb
itsPhlu: !keyboarddd
itsPhlu: dont work
tensorspac3: why?
gaocaandra: you are't learning t speack
itsPhlu: help
raisedbyphantom: what is he doing
whichtom: the media keeps overhyping/misunderstanding openai's work but openai doesn't really do anything to correct them
itsPhlu: helpll
bigie: the games are usually pretty complex compared to what people use it for. DDPG is used for robot arm control but might suck ass at dota
Mariosavitch: nothing @raisedbyphantom
orami: i believe he has an hhkb
PeinlicherAffe: @whichtom not his problem if he gets free promo
whichtom: yea generalization is obviously the biggest requirement for AGI that hasnt been met
gaocaandra: altough it beats kasparov in chess it doesn't know to 'play' chess
gaocaandra: that diference is subtle
bigie: AGI is not gonna happen without a big push from neuroscience but people are working on it.
whichtom: thats kinda philosophical
gaocaandra: that difference is the diference between AGI and ML
miloeu: is someone familiar with JS in .pdf files?
whichtom: do _we_ really know how to play chess, other than respond to inputs with some output
sceptix1337: you just need more compute for agi
whichtom: if we act instinctually, do we understand what we did
bigie: @georgehotz what does search() do in run_episode()? seems like you expect it to return the probability of tatking the action "1"
whichtom: @bigie ya I agree, need way more work in neuroscience
gaocaandra: I mean
bigie: ah ok makes sense now
sceptix1337: try leaning the stick and make some test cases if search() distribution makes sense
gaocaandra: the idea that a neuron firing in the brain is somehow equivalent to a linear function encased in a nonlinear functiom
gaocaandra: is ignorant of all the nuances
whichtom: oh yeah its not 1-to-1
CoachMeech: GOAT SHIT
gaocaandra: and processes that take place
bigie: @whichtom listel to lex friedman's podcast. there's a lot of work being put into AGI but mostly in neuroscience. it'll take a long long time
gaocaandra: on a human brain
maxschneider96: Hoping for deep reasoning to properly happen in 2020
metis_zver: Hi, what's your monitor?
emmbeezy: @georgehotz do you have a git where you publish these things?
whichtom: oh yeah Ive watched a lot of episodes of the AI podcast @bigie
PeinlicherAffe: funfact: you can't compute the total number of possibilities in chess. there's is an estimate/lower bound of 10^120 states (look shannon number) but probably way more
whichtom: its fantastic
sceptix1337: you just need more compute
whichtom: @emmbeezy geohot on github
gaocaandra: i think that AGI will emerge from a cellular automata
CoachMeech: what is a george hotz?
gaocaandra: and feed us all
gaocaandra: corn
sceptix1337: kb boss
sceptix1337: return loss 0 big brain

maxschneider96: @whichtom great podcast
bigie: that was a fun episode
I2btw: You sub to e-girls @georgehotz ?

I2btw: Pll sponser me my sub
Mrkz_: Hey everyone :) What's the topic of today?
bigie: the network represent an agent. the environment just tells it if it did "good" or "bad" using the reward function. it has to figure out what to do @sceptix1337
I2btw: mcretIQ

eyep1e: still using HHKB?
bigie: he runs it more than once but not a lot because it's not learning
sceptix1337: ok
jacekakacz: George what do you think about RaspberyyPi?

eyep1e: the energy comes from wearing a black hoodie
mangoxavier: George has already said that drugs only let you explore inside yourself. There's no point to that with what he's doing right now.
bigie: i wanna be on drugs but they're hard to get with the quarantine. bullshit
calcmath: can you somehow visualise the model of the environment that is learnt
gent03: FREE MY BOY QUICKFLOOR
PythonNoob: @bigie thats true ....

brkydnc: do you upload every stream yo do ?
maxschneider96: When will AI replace barbers? Can´ t get my hair cut during the lockdown...
sceptix1337: what did you even change lol
Penguino138: @brkydnc Comma AI Archive does on YT
brkydnc: thanks!
whichtom: @Santiago_LHC check the geohot github on geohot/ai-notebooks
mangoxavier: Will George be secluded to a compound in Alaska and drink all day and then run some lottery for his company where a guy comes and interacts with the stick but falls in love with the stick?
Dai_Vern0n: why does it stop?
god_damn: @Dai_Vern0n it get bored after 82
mangoxavier: Put a wig on the stick
TasosTheLord: NotLikeThis
Joooooooooonas: So what are we gonna do PogChamp
sceptix1337: make the stick a dick
mangoxavier: dat can be dat
mangoxavier: dis n dat
sceptix1337: can this balance stick in real time
Skyshifter: how many sims till the AI breaks out of its sandbox and beats u with the stick for making it do this menial shit for hours?
mangoxavier: a stick beating someone with a stick is meta af
logi6000: how was the alpha go movie
sceptix1337: wouldnt the cartpool hit him
sceptix1337: that looked smooth af
mangoxavier: alpha go movie is amazing
CoachMeech: NICE
mangoxavier: if you learn to play the game it will blow your mind
erichtp: extend stick length will it understand stick then
sceptix1337: now make it balance stick attached to stick
mangoxavier: it's mind blowing regardless but really useful to get a glimpse into how they layer ai and machine learning
sceptix1337: yeah lets go
sceptix1337: stick on stick
bigie: cartpole episode termination: length is greater than 200 (500 for v1). so your max score is around 200 i guess
sondreal: Remember to subscibe, its a really good investment boiiis! PogChamp
calcmath: can you try for longern than 100?
logi6000: @sondreal subs have bigger dix
Featen: rip
Skyshifter: surely the AI should be able to balance the stick perfectly eventually right? like no movement?
sondreal: logi6000 true
sceptix1337: local minimum go brrr
logi6000: stick balancer go brr
simmy7: simmy7 subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 5 months! 
calcmath: maybe neural network got bad initial weights
eldac_kno: are you gonna go on JRE
sun_is_not_yellow: !uptime
logi6000: @eldac_kno he probably won't
Featen: gamma?
eldac_kno: it would awesome tho
god_damn: @eldac_kno yeah cant wait to hear what he thinks about the ferguson fight
logi6000: @god_damn lol
calcmath: reinitialize the neuralnetwork between runs
Featen: go lower
eldac_kno: elk meat
sceptix1337: make an ai that finds the best gammi
sceptix1337: gamma
tessier_ashp00l: forget, JRE, do The Portal
Silodox: oh hey, sup hotz. i had you followed not when your first stream would be
Silodox: i vibe with your energy tho
eldac_kno: eric weinstein is a fraud sorry
tessier_ashp00l: i know
calcmath: you need to recompile the keras model to reinitialize neural networks weights otherwise it will always be stuck in local minima
whichtom: how is eric a fraud?
eldac_kno: he dont want publish paper on his "breaktrough" theory
god_damn: i miss 82
tessier_ashp00l: see if gh calls him on his shit
gigafact: It's nice to finally catch the stream live. We see some disconnects happened during the stream so more work for us to sync chat ect when uploading to youtube...
bigie: LUL what happened
Silodox: that is programming in a nutshell when you want to make edits, "hey yeah remember that time when it worked"
Silodox: lmao
eldac_kno: geohot is not a physiciat lol
Featen: "calcmath: you need to recompile the keras model to reinitialize neural networks weights otherwise it will always be stuck in local minima" ?
mangoxavier: mangoxavier subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
tessier_ashp00l: doesnt take a physicist to see he is a crank
mangoxavier: nice
dps910: hi
calcmath: You are just stuck inlocal minima, need to reinitialize weights
sceptix1337: local minimum go brr
eldac_kno: i mean there should be a paper and then physicist gonna make peer review and decide whether it is legit or not
tessier_ashp00l: there will never be a paper, thats the thing
Joselinis: all you need is lofi to make this work
eldac_kno: just publishing youtube video of your lecture is not a legit way to present your theory
Fr0zenOfficial: hello, what are you programming right now?
whichtom: I mean submitting papers for review is kinda a scam in itself but yea
whichtom: given reviewers are sometimes stupid and academia is wack but I get it
mangoxavier: That was easy, is prime sub okay too?
calcmath: please reinitialize ur NN
Featen: " @calcmath : you need to recompile the keras model to reinitialize neural networks weights otherwise it will always be stuck in local minima"
sceptix1337: geohot uses reinitalize! its very effective!
eldac_kno: perelman did paper, why eric is above that
bigie: yeah it shouldn't be that sensitive to hyperparameters.
whichtom: who knows
calcmath: thanks featen
tessier_ashp00l: eric is only looking for followers and fame
Silodox: hey to be fair the atari jaguar WAS kinda swink swank groovy tho
whichtom: a paper is a good idea anyways to formalize/convey ideas better
routerkicker: Peer review is utter shit but he could at least porst his paper on the internet. As long as he doesn't do that he's a scam to me.
whichtom: you don't go into physics/math for followers and fame lol
Waldoqq: HEY EVERYONE LOOK AT ME
mangoxavier: hi
Featen: @georgehotz " @calcmath : you need to recompile the keras model to reinitialize neural networks weights otherwise it will always be stuck in local minima"
calcmath: he will eventually restart kernel and it will reinitilize his model and it will work
gigafact: George did you watch the new Karpathy talk about TeslaAI? it was very interesting...
whichtom: like wolfram published his ideas and people tore him apart
auron018: greetings from albania!
sceptix1337: reinitialize my man
whichtom: 'published' I mean informally
jimbofreak: wouldn't adding one more stick to the system make everything way more complicated due to the fact that two sticks attached to a point show chaotic behavior?
sceptix1337: thats the point
routerkicker: doesn't matter. if the theorie's right people will have to eat their words eventually.
sceptix1337: we want to see if ai can solve advanced physics
mannekchin: HeyGuys
calcmath: keep trying different inits
eldac_kno: it already solves some of it
sceptix1337: this is like the villin, the initial position is bad for folding, you need to pull the stick at both ends
Featen: refit starts in local minimum already
mangoxavier: ohhhhh is this a Joe Baiden ai?
calcmath: NN are finicky like that, need to try many inits
calcmath: or make them wder
calcmath: wider*
mangoxavier: A stick that keeps forgetting
sceptix1337: search is bugged
sceptix1337: im callin it
mannekchin: Kappa
mannekchin: i wonder when he going to read this Kappa
sceptix1337: the cartpool isnt getting enough credit tbh
bigie: cartpole starts at upright so if it's ending at ~20 it's either going out of bounds facing down for 180 steps. probably the first one
bigie: *or facing down
curr1wurst: I wish I could code like him...
supplydemand88: sup
eldac_kno: just practice more
sceptix1337: back to the high numbers bois
supplydemand88: george what do you think is the best way to do (dis)similarity measures in python for ts? DTW, EDR or?
sceptix1337: nvm
mannekchin: for a begginer, what do you see that allows you to say wheter its elarning or not?
calcmath: is learning rate too high?
calcmath: the first number shoudl go down, second number should go up
norB88: https://gist.github.com/crizCraig/ec806f0d606c9e727512dce886bdc966
sceptix1337: number dont go right >:(
sceptix1337: why is there 0.00 and 0.99
sceptix1337: seems extreme
bigie: it should also usually have some random walk
calcmath: its not trained properly, so it wont make sense
pedrosantos867: guys what is this ide name
pedrosantos867: named?
nsielicki: that's jupyter
calcmath: jupyter
whichtom: its in a jupyter notebook
Ipkstef: hello what are weorking on today>?
eldac_kno: jew peter
sceptix1337: make the policy so the cartpool isnt rewarded for small movements
eldac_kno: funny?
bigie: maybe ye should also put a size limit on your replay buffer. they're talking about priority queue though so im not sure
Featen: isnt it just overfitting?
sceptix1337: those numbers look better
calcmath: if loss is decreasing but value is not increasing, yeah it seems like overfit
sceptix1337: restart kernel
THX1342: what framework is he using here? keraws?
THX1342: *keras
sceptix1337: it overfits to the stick being perfectly balanced
fearofcode: "Grrr" - also my experience with evolutionary computation
melahii: what do u think about colab
sceptix1337: it needs more tilt
calcmath: change number of layers/ number of neurons?
sceptix1337: use cuda
phelipe3: yo!
mannekchin: dont bother, he doesnt read chat PepeLaugh
bigie: bad policies can fill the replay buffer with garbage which makes the policy even worse
eldac_kno: he reads only useful comments made by Subscribers
sceptix1337: play with the replay buffer size
Emma_Cakes: Good evening :)
calcmath: bad policies dictate how action space is explored right?
timeiskey: are you doing old fashioned experience replay? if yes, make sure to fit each experience individually, not in a batch, or the errors will be MSE'd and be like 1/K the size they should be
sceptix1337: ^
timeiskey: it looks like you are forwarding them all in a batch, so your error will be too tiny
nsielicki: if  len(replay_buffer) < 10: replay_buffer = replay_buffer[0:50] ???
sceptix1337: ikr seems like oob access
timeiskey: GO READ MY MESSAGE AAAG
lord_alpaca_666: I am glad this is no longer a subscriber only chat. Thank you, george.
timeiskey: THE TAB ON mu.fit is ONE TO THE LEFT
C4TFive: how that match stick treating you george?
calcmath: i think fit should be outside that loop right
nsielicki: read chat^^^^ indentation bug
eldac_kno: big brain energy right there
FargioFarmani: @georgehotz There is this good book which might help you: "Deep Reinforcement Learning in Action"
sceptix1337: yeah sure hes just gonna read the book now
eldac_kno: is Art of programming worth studying?
calcmath: i think he prefers to learns hthings by doing
FargioFarmani: its new
ortunado: its like March 2020
ortunado: i think
MoProject: ho
sceptix1337: audit the search function
死ね: can u do a rice overview real quick?
fancyslimshady: youtube
sceptix1337: thats what im betting on
justcrash: hotz's stream and my life suddenly stops being miserable
timeiskey: MR HOTZ, you gotta fit the replays INDIVIDUALLY. SEQUENTIALLY. NOT IN A BATCH FIT
timeiskey: AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH
nsielicki: george, read timeiskey messages above, you have a simple bug
PeinlicherAffe: BRO SEQUENTIALLY
cankoloz: @timeiskey LUL

eldac_kno: lol
nsielicki: wow this is lame read the fucking chat george
Artara_: most interactive twitch chat LUL
sceptix1337: try policy, if that dont work listen to timeiskey

nsielicki: i'm just worried that once he gets around to chat it's gonna be off his screen and he's not going to see it.
ortunado: @7Locrian7 i dont think so, we dont see green tea
calcmath: so what you are saying is you should train on one experience replay at a time?
justcrash: just write the n word and he will be alerted in seconds
timeiskey: lets vote with spam
alextodoroki: LOL
7Locrian7: monkaS
FargioFarmani: naughty
sceptix1337: vote with sperm
ozychhicodes: There's no 3
fearofcode: would it help to compare to possible working implementations like https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general/blob/master/games/cartpole.py ?
timeiskey: you gotta fit the replays individually sequentially not in a batch fit
eldac_kno: georgi boi is such qt when focused
timeiskey: spam go
norB88: @timeiskey shouldnt you have both? Individual and batched?
sceptix1337: SEQUENTIALLY

whichtom: @henistein only for OS development or reverse engineering probably
bigie: what was k to begin with? is it an algorithm specific thing ?
plazmacsgo: what is he measuring?. loss, accuracy, episode survived?
whichtom: @bigie the muzero paper says K=5 for their results
Mariosavitch: bless you
bigie: ah thanks @whichtom
bigie: they have a prioritized replay buffer. that one's way better than normal experience replay
b2kemann: u need a burger
malmeani: now the value of my sub just went up
numinousloop: they were convinced they knew what the problem with your code was
Mariosavitch: you should train the inputs to your inputs
bigie: i hate that it's only possible in python & slow. i want an ML/DL framework in C++
malmeani: we love you
smurfd0: from the paper, "Predictions are made at each time-stept, for each ofk= 1...Ksteps" for the one asking about what K was

gaocaandra: did it ever work
b2kemann: swift is the answer @bigie
gaocaandra: where us the rant
gaocaandra: ?
nsielicki: longtime watcher, first time subscribing. I literally linked timeiskey to the stream because he knows a lot about this. You're convinced he was wrong, I'm fairly certain he knew what he was talking about.
pwnbase: @bigie the python is just an api, all the heavy lifting is done in c++
nsielicki: subscribed literally just to tell you to fuck yourself.
gaocaandra: beggining of stream
gaocaandra: ?

b2kemann: @bigie why the hate
plazmacsgo: @nsielicki ????????
PeinlicherAffe: xD

b2kemann: you can say fuck you george, but yuou have to be a subscriber
routerkicker: i don't know much about this. what's wrong with the proposal of fitting every episode?

eldac_kno: I would call Poker Ai Wittgenstein
Ne0Zer0: def feel the frustration with ml
bigie: i pay more because i'm in germany and pay 4.99 euros instead of 4.99 dollars. that's also price discrimination
gaocaandra: have you looked at wolfram lang?
eldac_kno: that's the price for not being a part of the US boi
bigie: is any RL algorithm stable though ?
Penguino138: He learned so well :')
zyrax222: i have no idea what you're doing but im enjoying it

murkythunder: ppl have said this printing doesn't cause inflation but i nvr understand :(
chemicalflash: but don't they have to sell bonds in order to print
eeXecute: Look at that loop FeelsGoodMan
Kalland: the difference is who you tax. if you print you tax people who have money. not who earn money.
saixj: we should just sell a state to canada or mexico to get rid of debt

gigafact: it did not even finish uploading to youtube should I just attach this stream as well to just one upload George?
ad5k: have you seen wolfram's new theory of everything
saff__: give me points
pwnbase: make it 1337 points
gigafact: OK
Mint2bSpiced: you earn channel points by watching hours of your stream
joseanavarrom: For how long do you usually sleep?
Penguino138: Is it still subs only?
aar0npham: looks like it now
Penguino138: Welcome productive and positive members of the stream... Lets program
nashesvobodnoye: nashesvobodnoye subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! <3 is heart
eldac_kno: can we ban sleep questions
TheSkapegoat: Hey GeoHot, which company do you think is an underrated competitor in the autonomous vehicles market?
Lizardan: Subs only PogChamp .. hello plebs HeyGuys
Penguino138: Unless george says so, questions should be related to the stream topic
microx0ft: are you only using python for this?
gigafact: people can "lash out" on youtube if they want. there is quite a few strange people on youtube but majority of people really love your streams George
grey_street: what's your idea of optimal sleep Kappa
aar0npham: facts
Penguino138: @georgehotz did you make any progress since last the stream?
bugbrar: I am not a subscriber, but I would like to able to learn by asking questions, so I would appreciate it if people stopped asking unrelated questions/spamming. Please.
Santiago_LHC: keyword: prediction
saff__: don't do it
saff__: end of
xeeton: what is the real-world length of each time step?
Killeraing: wow you were coding all night?
powerofpickle: You have gone on tangents in past streams so I guess people are adapting
jasondesante: love you dude
Penguino138: Yeah some of the nature hacking streams had great thought provoking convos too
eldac_kno: do you think gpt 2 is overrated
jontowtruck: how are you still trying to implement this lol it probably has the most descriptive/informative appendix to dissect
devm0d: What are we hacking on tonight?
gigafact: I am currently working on a project and it's really wearing me out. It's not healthy at all but the result is going to be amazing. It's all worth-it in the end.
TheSkapegoat: Can AlphaZero be applied to truly everything or do you think its inherent to strategy based activity?
xeeton: @georgehotz thx for the answer
devm0d: Thank you
keith282: @gigafact Are you okay bro?
joseanavarrom: What are you planning to use it on?
TheSkapegoat: Do you think AlphaZero is a leap in AI or simply a noticed step?
Santiago_LHC: AlphaZero knew the rules to the games, right?
gigafact: Have been sleeping only a few hours a day. I have not been so tired in all my life.
alfyfav: So why don't you go to sleep @gigafact ?
Jehhred: @gigafact Maybe you shouldn't be on twitch then and instead doing the project?
Penguino138: @gigafact Try to get some sleep and it might help overcome the project obstacles you're facing :)
Lentaij: Anyone have a link to the paper?
eldac_kno: just google it bro
ak0ya_: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.08265.pdf
gigafact: The problem is that even when I am going to sleep I am still thinking about the project. I can't seep for very long... Don't know if you had that feeling...
hurzg: I wonder if a prediction network is really necessary, if the world is based on relative simple physics... however in this way its a nice and general approach.
grey_street: twitch prime can chat
axlebear: I'm twitch prime
alfyfav: @gigafact maybe I could help you with your project. Follow me on twitter. Username: localhost666

TheSkapegoat: Do you think quantum computing is what will truly accelerate AI or is it mostly figuring out the software side of things such as what you are learning from this paper?
Mint2bSpiced: for the background noise reduction
DeeboMC: 7 in nyc lol
synthetic11000: 7pm cheer
calcmath: is he starting from scratch?
eldac_kno: yes
DeeboMC: He said 8
alfyfav: @isyraq1 he have sayed that before. Just sit down and think about what you want to do, and do it investigating and reading, just like he's doing it rn
Rashad242: Rashad242 subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! I'm just here to c greatness
hurzg: quantum computers are pretty useless right now I guess @TheSkapegoat googles QC can only generate a certain type of random distribution
Santiago_LHC: Interesting clip from a recent Lex Friedman interview with David Silver (one of the authors of the MuZero paper) on AlphaZero and self-play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e77NkSjnyH4
axlebear: pytorch DansGame
eldac_kno: wtf are these questions
Mig1939: What exactly are you trying to do with MuZero on this stream?
raisedbyphantom: how long is he streaming
optimizely: can you make terminal bigger
DeeboMC: Ima go ahead and subscribe anyway homie.. hold on a minute
programmer42: which python's vim package are you using ?
lebop: WHAT IS MUZERO
raisedbyphantom: !stream
Santiago_LHC: MuZero is the latest ai from DeepMind
eldac_kno: wtf is this chat
calcmath: muzero is reinforcement learning algorithm
aar0npham: why do they use elu instead of leakyReLU?
alfyfav: @lebop why don't you google it?
CensoredAlex: what are we doing?
eldac_kno: writing muzero
ak0ya_: muzero paper reading
tremendomendez: :)
Penguino138: Muzero is an AI model that was used in AlphaGo for those wondering
optimizely: can you make terminal bigger
eldac_kno: petaaah is about to get banned
CensoredAlex: nice
asselbergs: Good evening George. Fun coding time again.
Penguino138: A complicated AI model that is used for predictions if I am right

eldac_kno: just as always, george is gonna play with some new model/algorithm and that's about it
Bootstraps: @georgehotz can you give a brief summary about what we are trying to accomplish?
hurzg: the idea is: start of with a simple problem to learn and understand the method
CensoredAlex: PotgChamp
greaserthegreat: Connected my amazon account just for this
Penguino138: Welcome new subscribers
CensoredAlex: @greaserthegreat SeemsGood
williami000: congratz on subbing
calcmath: increased font size of code would be helpful
greaserthegreat: Thanks yall
Santiago_LHC: "MuZero learns a model that, when applied iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art."
aar0npham: can u just load pretrained weight?
JdPaulBlart: no thats cheating
calcmath: i think the point is to learn how the algorithm that creates the weights works
Bootstraps: george what are you trying to accomplish?
memogainz: memogainz subscribed at Tier 1. 
mrmusicmaine: thanks @santiago_lhc
JdPaulBlart: solving coronavirus with muzero
Jehhred: @Bootstraps World Domination, obviously
mrmusicmaine: @calcmath Yee same

CensoredAlex: @Bootstraps Getting the optimal quantity of lysol in a vaccine Kappa
Bootstraps: inject disinfectant
neilsweb: Thank you soooo much for donating $1 billion worth of your equity in Square to fund COVID-19 relief around the world. Donating roughly 28 percent of your net worth is remarkable.. thank you!!!
mrmusicmaine: 3b1b is wonderful
Penguino138: keep the chat on topic
aar0npham: i think its time to get back to sub mode
ak0ya_: :(
rickoftheroot: monkaS
CensoredAlex: true, sorry.
tornpaperyoyos: @penguino138 no
mrmusicmaine: fair
Santiago_LHC: I can mod the off-topic nonsense

mashafique: LUL
Killeraing: rules*
TheBlackzillian: what is muzero?
memogainz: Can you quickly explain what's the purpose of Jupyter in your workflow?
Major_Spicy: @georgehotz what is your goal with this program u are making?
Abnico: can i be a mod im also gay
jmp0ut: @geohotz you see the kernel chocolate_milk gamozo has been working on for fuzzing, literally 0days all known hardware and software, 1 shot
JesseSkinner: sub chat includes twitch subscribers
Mig1939: 0.0001% of chat understands anything you do here.
joseanavarrom: I think submode does include twitch prime people
Penguino138: @TheBlackzillian It's a complex AI prediction architecture used in things like AlphaGo
leonardssh22: mornin' geo
SHREKonVHS: umm george are u well
JesseSkinner: sub chat includes twitch prime subscribers, i mean
Gree_OW: @georgehotz Did those proteins ever fold?
Santiago_LHC: Thank you, I'll instate order
Santiago_LHC: and fear
jontowtruck: please for the love of god use the vim keymaps
rickoftheroot: monkaW
iKanak_: iKanak_ subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! 
Penguino138: @Santiago_LHC Congrats on the mod upgrade!
neilsweb: because when u suck at coding you can test your code blocks easily and often.
jcernuda95: @memogainz the code seems to be controlling a openai gym environment that is a balancing pole on a wheel by using a new ai model released recently
Abnico: what is he using muzero for?
eldac_kno: nothing for now
Abnico: i wanted a chat observer but muzero was to hard for me
Penguino138: @Abnico For a physics simulation to balance a stick sort of thing
jmp0ut: also faster computation
hurzg: balancing a stick
Penguino138: ALEXXXXXX
Bootstraps: HI ALEX
leonardssh22: hi alex
mashafique: HI Alex

joseanavarrom: HELLOOO
eldac_kno: lol
Santiago_LHC: Hello Alex
CensoredAlex: hey
aar0npham: lol
Killeraing: sup
Penguino138: It's tough dealing with friends who freak out about it
Bootstraps: alex are you coming over tonight?
SHREKonVHS: george are u being friend zoned
p4ri: LOL
Bootstraps: bring steak!!
p4ri: who is talking too
p4ri: he*
rrittenhouse: LOL
rickoftheroot: KonCha
Abnico: george, ur wifes boyfriend makes good steaks
SHREKonVHS: f r i e n d z o n e s
Junki4: the sound of ur HHKB is so relaxing
r00tkey: You are still up!
Drifter0o: georgeeee!!! nice to see you
aar0npham: bans coming up
Bootstraps: george do you like your steak well done?
ralaxe: what are you doing exactly i don't understand
bugbrar: That was very sweet
eldac_kno: do you like 3b1b videos?
diazz_15: Smooth fckn operator
Penguino138: Alex and George = goals
Newlax: terrible things
Santiago_LHC: Behave guys, Alex will be in chat
Newlax: @programmer42 https://github.com/geohot/configuration
PristineBanana: now I want steaks
neilsweb: Can Alex write python?
eldac_kno: english only, amigo
Gree_OW: @georgehotz Did anything ever come of the protein folding? I really enjoyed those streams
Santiago_LHC: English only
cod4_lightning: can you show your mac dotfiles?
dalvasorsali: I have a frozen steak but no idea how to cook it from frozen...
Abnico: protein is still trying to fold u can check the status on proteinbank
neilsweb: first time i see him reading slowly. usually he just skips overr everything.
calcmath: I think main goal of MCTS is to balance exploration and exploitation
sajugabru: lmao
BumD197: hi, is there a target application he's trying to implement or just exploring the muzero?
SHREKonVHS: imagine if newton said it doesnt work before writing principia
JdPaulBlart: using muzero to solve coronavirus
Penguino138: @BumD197 Right now we're just exploring and understanding through this paper
SHREKonVHS: sad gamer moment
jmp0ut: one pagefile
aar0npham: is it a subspace then?
Newlax: @cod4_lightning https://github.com/geohot/configuration
calcmath: i think time is still discrete
eldac_kno: bigbrain moment
gigafact: I wish some smart people like Lex would join the stream and help.
eDONze: DuduSoloTop subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
neilsweb: nobody liked my joke, where i confused him for Jack Dorsey :-(
ad5k: why is it a continuous space?
Major_Spicy: @Penguino138 what is he trying to exactly? I just joined.
jmp0ut: ad5k because a protein can continuously fold
jmp0ut: until it reaches original
Drifter0o: George you ever used the app magnet?
DeeboMC: Subscription incoming
Penguino138: We're learning how Muzero, a complex AI Predictive network works, and applying it to a relatively simple physics simulation to keep a stick balanced
Penguino138: @Major_Spicy
Major_Spicy: Thanks a lot dude framedOh
ad5k: isn't the context chess, atari etc where position is discrete
DeeboMC: deebomc subscribed at Tier 3. 
calcmath: the neural network can handle continous states
DeeboMC: Party time
ooMariaoo: caught the stream :)
Bootstraps: are we watching alpha go on stream together late today?
greaserthegreat: Could it be possible that continous is just the theoretic and is implemented with a finite number of discrete states. The delta in time could be small enough to provide a close enough answer to the continious model?
SHREKonVHS: bruh the ice chewing has returned
eldac_kno: chewing ice hurts bro
hurzg: isnt it quantized by the time steps?
sajugabru: they start at initial state and deterministically step through the space
Mint2bSpiced: @Penguino138 is this like the AI used in SteadyCams and drones ?
SHREKonVHS: no
Penguino138: @Mint2bSpiced I'm not sure, it maybe be more applicable to games but I don't believe so
Abnico: steady cam does background stitching
achamorro008: geooohotz
Bootstraps: POGGERS
Bootstraps: psuedo code
dalvasorsali: Isn't this similar to q learning/sarsa?
doganigooo2: yo helloo what's going on here
Major_Spicy: Fancy framedPOG
eldac_kno: btw in russian it's pronounced geohot -g-like in garden
calcmath: i believe the difference is a model of the environment is learnt
BumD197: the thing is if only given rules makes this AI algorithm somewhat find the problem and solves it, pretty amazing, but i imagine it couldn't be easy as it sounds
doganigooo2: @BumD197 probably it is not
Penguino138: @doganigooo2 Learning about Muzero, and complex predictive AI network
abhi1o1: i went to sleep go up and he is still streaming
bfpixels: @georgehotz im sub VIM vs VS Code?
calcmath: you need balance exploration and exploitation
DeeboMC: That’s nice pseudo code
Mint2bSpiced: @Abnico I mean the AI for the stepper motors inside the handles of the Steadicam, not the video editing software stabization
eldac_kno: ide question is the new kb question
Bootstraps: this pseudo code looks better than my real code
Bootstraps: wtf
sajugabru: what is the purpose of the tree search?
eldac_kno: that's what pseudo code is for
calcmath: UCB is the principled way of doing it, with theoretical backing, but ya simple would stilll work
diazz_15: @bootstraps I was thinking the same shit lol
DeeboMC: Same lol
axlebear: What is a leaf node again?
Penguino138: @sajugabru typically the tree is used to path out the predictions for future possibilities and moves in a game
Abnico: @Mint2bSpiced okie yeah
eldac_kno: leaf node is final node
calcmath: leaf node is end of game
DecayingSkullz: It's a node with no child
ad5k: leaf node is an end state?
1boi: really
gigafact: at least they have comments in the code
puffgrape: r we folding protein or we past that?
sajugabru: so if the functions that represent internal state stop changing then you've reached a leaf node?
ak0ya_: folding is done
eldac_kno: we are past that
puffgrape: ahhh ok
ak0ya_: this is a new project
eldac_kno: protein question = ban
hurzg: is a node itself simply a "move" in the game?
puffgrape: shit didnt know lol
dalvasorsali: @georgehotz Isn't this similar to q learning/sarsa?
guinness84: have you explore counterfactual regret minimizartion
guinness84: explored*
calcmath: only way to see reward if its realised only at the end of the game
Penguino138: @hurzg pretty much yes, it is a step, and typically has a weight attached to describe the probability/prediction
guinness84: o cool
kevin21071: what so you have to know the max moves for each game?
hurzg: @Penguino138 thanks
posixninja: if this has nothing to do with protein folding I'm lost
greaserthegreat: I agree it seems like it can't go to a true leaf node? maybe an arbitrary point is chosen and a score is calcualted?
greaserthegreat: new to this technique so just throwing out ideas
ad5k: is reward probabilistic in intermediate time steps?
socialnotsocial: what do you think about the general stagnation argument presented by Peter Thiel, Tyler Cowen and others?
calcmath: if game has no intermediate rewards or reward shaping, you sort of have to do it till end right?
CaptCalifornia: ICE CRUNCH monkaS
Penguino138: @posixninja we are past folding, moving on to AI prediction applied to physics
sajugabru: why isn't there intermediate reward shaping?
calcmath: in chess you only know if won or lost at the end
posixninja: molcular dynamics?
calcmath: not applicable for stick balancing
calcmath: but algorithm is general
ad5k: "MuZero also extends AlphaZero to a broader set of environments including single agent domains and non-zero rewards at intermediate time-steps."
gigafact: George would you work at Deep Mind?
raisedbyphantom: how long has he been streamin ?
DeeboMC: Like 30 min
posixninja: can someone point me to the whitepaper?
ak0ya_: @posixninja folding project is over
janpoonthong: How did you learn python by coures? or Turtuoirl from Youtube?
PristineBanana: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265 @posixninja
ak0ya_: https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.08265
DeeboMC: 45 maybe
Penguino138: Yeah chatt has approved a lot so far
JdPaulBlart: its because im here
DeeboMC: No it’s me bro
JdPaulBlart: i increase the average intelligence of the chat
DeeboMC: Oh yea ur right
raisedbyphantom: def
sajugabru: @calcmath so it seems the main contribution of the paper is how they can make a model of games that don't currently have perfect simulators?
kisspapa: you ever have any fun with the open source voice builder tool google released
calcmath: yeah you simultaneously learn a model for the environment, as recurrent neural net
JesseSkinner: hm could it be applied to a game like .. the stock market?
DeeboMC: That’s scary stuff
JdPaulBlart: this light mode is hurting my eyes DansGane
JdPaulBlart: DansGame
sajugabru: then which tree search algo you use is irrelevant to the goal of this research right
posixninja: I'm still learning the personalities of amino acids :-(
calcmath: yeas so long as it balances exploration an dexploitation
janpoonthong: How did you learn python by coures? or Turtuoirl from Youtube?
calcmath: he can just implement an epsilon-greedy version instead of UCB version, but it will be less efficient
Nussinov: im trying to learn coding for 2 months now and I feel utterly retarded
dalvasorsali: @janpoonthong you learn by doing
Penguino138: @janpoonthong you learn to code through tutorials and just doing it
grizvok: 2 months is nothing
DeeboMC: Fred Baptise’s Python Deep Dive series on udemy
diazz_15: 2 months is legit nothing
gigafact: maybe this will help? https://medium.com/applied-data-science/how-to-build-your-own-muzero-in-python-f77d5718061a
diazz_15: Try 10 years and still not knowing wtf is going on lol
MorningLightGamer: if you google for "muzero-general" you can find a github repo that can maybe be helpful
nick_larsen: I gave 30 min talk on this in the live coders conf a couple weeks ago
nick_larsen: MCTS not MuZero
tragic_tf_up: what did you do when you were younger to motivate yourself?
DecayingSkullz: ban incoming
Nussinov: wait 2 months is nothing? that makes me feel better I suppose
JesseSkinner: @Nussinov yeah thats like, learning to read for 2 months ...
nick_larsen: What the question right now?
Santiago_LHC: No keyboard talk. Chat 101
Nussinov: @JesseSkinner oh LUL i thought i would just kinda pick it up quickly since a lot of people seem to know it
janpoonthong: What's your IDE?
hsydf92: what is being coded
Penguino138: @Nussinov You will likely have a long journey with programming. Full of failures and successes. You have to enjoy it for sure
JesseSkinner: @Nussinov some people have been doing it since they were kids.. its a new way of thinking for many who pick it up later in life
janpoonthong: from musro.model import musi.model
Nussinov: @JesseSkinner damn that is a huge advantage LUL im 20 now so its not so bad
janpoonthong: I think
JesseSkinner: @Nussinov and the biggest thing is getting used to things being broken 99% of the time. when it's working, you're done!
Penguino138: Exactly, and programming will give you serious power and freedom, so it is worth it in the end
bfpixels: my only advice is build things. It can be easy to stay in tutorial purgatory.
jsnfly: jsnfly subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
grizvok: @bfpixels agreed. a huge mistake people often fall for.
grekler3: @Nussinov im 2 months stuck just learning data management in flutter lul .. i mean i can just copy a yt vid, but i need to go back and re learn dart and sql fundamentals, i need to fully get the concepts
Nussinov: @bfpixels luckily I have a degree in biochemistry so the applications are abundant in bioinformatics-related areas
Penguino138: @Nussinov Yes always go for practical programming examples, and slowly crawl your way through, you will learn a ton!
janpoonthong: @bfpixels So you mean tutorial are ehh
ivche1337: eyy sub only is gone lesgoo
ak0ya_: chat became an emotional support group for Nussinov :)
Penguino138: @ak0ya_ better that than the toxicity that caused sub only mode earlier today
socialnotsocial: @georgehotz what do you think about the general stagnation argument presented by Peter Thiel, Tyler Cowen and others?
Nussinov: @ak0ya_ hell yes! im feeling much better lol
echobrother: what's the IDE
hsydf92: vim
hsydf92: @echobrother vim and jupyter notebook
ak0ya_: dev env
bfpixels: @echobrother it's not an IDE he's using a text editor called vim.
Santiago_LHC: No stupid offtopic questions
Bloodswordz88: We fold fam
hsydf92: @santiago_lhc no questions are stupid
Penguino138: Someday ill be lucky enough to join Santiago and keep the chat clean dotsHappy
BumD197: does George have github page?
DeeboMC: Ban
ivche1337: there are no stupid questions, only stupid answers
Santiago_LHC: That a stupid question, but I'll allow it, because it's not entirely off topic :P
quinquanonagintilliard: What's the stupid question again?
ivche1337: Kappa Kappa
BumD197: my question?
dontbeameme: Did make cold fusion yet?
DeeboMC: “Does he have a github”; yes
Santiago_LHC: @BumD197 https://github.com/geohot/
BumD197: i looked at info below there wasnt any info so i asked
HalluCinogen151: Whats up man
calcmath: yeah i dont know why there are 2 num steps
BumD197: better put it some info if you dont like that question being asked
hichm19956: what happend boss?
dontbeameme: Singularity in 3 2 1
calcmath: can you zoom the medium post a little
beefydangles: did you ever figure out that beer virus?
gabryelportuga: windows > linux, and who disagree is right
Penguino138: @beefydangles no he moved on from it
hsydf92: zoom vim screen a little
iIyaRPV: stop writing cringe jokes and stupid questions in chat BlessRNG
MorningLightGamer: @georgehotz or mods, can I post a github link that may (or not) be useful?
beefydangles: @Penguino138 10 4
WhispyHerc: chat what is he working on?
gabryelportuga: @WhispyHerc muzero
WhispyHerc: yeah but what is he building @gabryelportuga
Penguino138: @All He is learning Muzero, a complex predictive AI network he is using to apply to a basic physics simulation
WhispyHerc: thanks @Penguino138
Santiago_LHC: @MorningLightGamer Yeah
DeeboMC: @Santiago_LHC pardon the off-topicness: Anyone know why the stream, on my laptop, is like 9-10 seconds behind the stream on my phone?
MorningLightGamer: https://github.com/werner-duvaud/muzero-general

LiveCustoms: I wanna go outside
WhispyHerc: so how is he implementing AI in a basic physics simulations? @Penguino138
Penguino138: @WhispyHerc you may see it soon, but we are using it to run a physics sim that balances a stick
WhispyHerc: how so an entity has to figure out how to balance a stick? @Penguino138
WhispyHerc: *oh
WhispyHerc: sounds interesting
hurzg: the thing is that the prediction network can learn all kinds of dependencies... also things, that can not be easily modelled via physics... its about learning the method itself
calcmath: why is choosing complete random actions correct here?
aaryan4: what are you working on?
gabryelportuga: he is pissed, aparently
Penguino138: @WhispyHerc Chat can correct me if i'm wrong, but I believe it uses the tree search to predict the best physical translation/action to take to keep the stick balanced
HalluCinogen151: He's hacking at corona
l1ght5p33d: everything is a tree search
l1ght5p33d: we want lookup tables
WhispyHerc: i see
eDONze: cocktop
gigafact: George did you see this https://github.com/koulanurag/muzero-pytorch been tested on CartPole-v1?
forkdb: Wow
posixninja: george just likes talking to himself and doesn't want to feel crazy
roletro: @georgehotz mcts is just a random search (with many samples) to a final state and relying on the statistics of the randomness to represent the overall picture of an action that prompted the search.
forkdb: Amazing....
forkdb: HelloGeorge
hichm19956: great,
posixninja: <3
forkdb: How are you doing?
hurzg: as far as i understood, the algorithm has to decide in which direction it has to accalerate the stick at each time step. each step is a node. and the tree search finds the best movement for each node
Penguino138: Yeah what hurzg said
WhispyHerc: i wonder how many nodes there are in say a second
blueberryguac: ban me
WhispyHerc: if thats even how that works
WhispyHerc: or "step"
gigafact: Someone already used MuZero for your problem George https://github.com/koulanurag/muzero-pytorch

DecayingSkullz: just stop asking these questions please
calcmath: practice makes perfect
Protoxus: 1. don't be noob
forkdb: Am not asking for answers
DeeboMC: Wastes of 380
forkdb: I just want to understand his thought process
WhispyHerc: waste
DeeboMC: Lol
psychicsides: Like they are worth anything @deebomc
raisedbyphantom: @Protoxus what a brilliant advice
khilshot: which programming language do you use for programming interviews?
masters8: take my points
roletro: well the goal of mcts is to randomly search until it reaches a state where no further action is needed or possible.
erlsek: waste
Hamled: I think the previous message about practice is an accurate representation of his thinking
shoji22: PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT GUYS, THAT'S THE KEY
Protoxus: raisedbyphantom I was just paraphrasing George
greaserthegreat: @khilshot the one you are most comfortable with and supports OOO
Hamled: you won't get good at anything you don't practice
raisedbyphantom: @Protoxus I know, no pun intented ;)
Protoxus: raisedbyphantom :P

jax05_: just don't practice the wrong way heh
DeeboMC: What part of the head?
Jakob753951: All of it lol
BumD197: why does it matter @forkdb you can't understand people's thought process, and if you understand that you wouldn't ask
Penguino138: @bfpixels Your head can hurt from learning too much stuff, but make sure you're hydrating and have enough protein for ur brain
WhispyHerc: cerebrum
calcmath: its an exploration policy
DeeboMC: @bumd197 exactly
bfpixels: tension headaches especially trying to read what he's doing.

pelegogrosso: codecademy is good or books are better?
ak0ya_: it's no off-topic question chat today
GandalfTheGrayOfHell: Books are better
GandalfTheGrayOfHell: Any given day
RomeroCesar: that's a personal choice @pelegogrosso
DeeboMC: They’re complementary
Protoxus: @pelegogrosso Depends on what you're learning. For frameworks and languages, I'd say online documentation is better since it's updated. For general concepts, books are better.
GandalfTheGrayOfHell: Develop a habit of reading to partially become as smart as George
Protoxus: - My opinion, at least
RomeroCesar: I prefer books, but many prefer lectures, other prefer hacking. Knowing how you learn best is important
DeeboMC: You can’t become smarter necessarily.. knowledgeable and skillful, yes
bcihacker: what happened to #hack-covid?
GandalfTheGrayOfHell: You know how George reads stuff from papers and directly implements it , u need a hell lot of reading practice for it
WhispyHerc: you can become smarter but not more intelligent
lolzmaster99: What game os he applying muzero to?
ak0ya_: @bcihacker its over
lolzmaster99: Is there a new paper out?
Penguino138: @lolzmaster99 CartPole-v0
DeeboMC: Eh, semantics
ak0ya_: it's a november paper
bcihacker: @ak0ya_ oh. lost touch a bit.
DeeboMC: I use “smart” interchangeably with “intelligent”; am I wrong?
lolzmaster99: Yeah implementing papers is tough working on one rn
pelegogrosso: some good forum to learn languages?
WhispyHerc: i like to use "smart" as level of knowledge possesed and "intelligence" for intelligence
Santiago_LHC: Sigh
bcihacker: @lolzmaster99 wdym implementing papers? Just came on chat, so lost context a bit lol
DeeboMC: Fair enough
lolzmaster99: Taking a research paper in L and writing code to implement the algorithm described in it
lolzmaster99: ML*
in_just: Saw your podcast interview with Lex recently, not too shabby
DeeboMC: Minimally shabby
RomeroCesar: @pelegogrosso assuming you mean programming languages, I prefer reading a book instead of following some tutorial or lecture. Something like the "in a nutshell" series from oreilly are good if you already know at least one other language
calcmath: did he already implment make target function?
in_just: It's weird how he runs it out of a hotel room but I guess the point is to get the audio so doesn't really matter
lolzmaster99: geohot have you tried TF Agents?
RomeroCesar: was there a new one with lex?
DeeboMC: I think the locations vary
GandalfTheGrayOfHell: @georgehotz https://youtu.be/Ir7wCAQINqw comma.camera?
bcihacker: @lolzmaster99 hmm that sounds interesting. So does that mean that your algorithm needs to figure out the algorithm written about given an ML paper?
DeeboMC: No; he’s referring to the original I believe
in_just: Yeah the original
lolzmaster99: @bcihacker No, the paper proposes an algorithm and you implement it
in_just: lol
DeeboMC: Good choice
bcihacker: @lolzmaster99 any more info on it? article/paper/etc
Santiago_LHC: That's what he thinks
bcihacker: @lolzmaster99 sounds pretty interesting.
lolzmaster99: @bcihacker MuZero from DeepMind
calcmath: is make targets implemented already

dantehemerson: Is this ML, DP or what is this?
dantehemerson: DL*
lolzmaster99: ML
calcmath: it gives you both
worraaa: RL, coding muzero to solve cartpole :)
dantehemerson: @lolzmaster99 is basic or advanced?
fatpanda168: anyone excited about nvidia announcement in may
lolzmaster99: Advanced
calcmath: I think it gives both, value function dicates policy so its more fundamental
pelegogrosso: is there some restrictions in this chat? because i'm new in the cs and maybe some questions mine can sounds idiot.

gaocaandra: how big a gpu farm would you need to train a model like that?
in_just: For Go? They spent $25 million I read
ohheyitsrainy: depends on how much time you have :P
gaocaandra: dayum

BumD197: isn't that algorithm trained in 4 hours or something
BumD197: for go or chess
Penguino138: PIZZAAA
gaocaandra: 35 million By one estimate, the training time for AlphaGo cost $35 million;
gaocaandra: thats what google says
alfyfav: I got scared because I thought that noise was on my place

calcmath: an AI is learning to balance a stick, the AI has no exposeure to physics before
StopitDonk: whats so exciting about 200?
lebop: ^
calcmath: maximum reward
calcmath: it fails very human like
z00fle: what's considered "pass" ?
calcmath: reward is to last for as many steps as possible
BumD197: it looks like too easy job for this AI
calcmath: pass is it balances for long time
z00fle: for one trial? or X in a row
calcmath: if truly learnt in a general way, it should balance beyond 200 steps even though it was trained only for 200 steps
lolzmaster99: One run should be able to last indefinetly
lolzmaster99: Due to the simplicity of cartpole

QUOTE_IF_NEXT_YEAR_BETTER: You start with artificial intelligence that can learn, adapt and improve itself. Because computers run so much faster than the human mind, the artificial intelligence becomes smarter and smarter at an exponential rate until it is so much more intelligent than we could ever imagine. Public figures such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have expressed concern that full artificial intelligence (AI) could result in human extinction. How do you plan on stopping this from happening?

Protoxus: Hermetic philosophy is pretty dank, IMO
jmp0ut: some of which are unfounded
ggtom: i agree it gives focus as well

jmp0ut: which is horrifying
Abnico: what happened to matt's crypto religon?
Gamer_nohope: you can join games and coding...
agentvenom2: iterated prisoner's dilemma favors nice strategies though
balloonpopa: Religion is a matter between a man and his God - Thomas Jefferson
calcmath: progressivism i a kind a new relisigion, so just looking at olny old fashoined religion is not enough

FreddiesDeadieButHasAces: I tried to get a test they said I wasn't sick, but I work at BK so I thought it was a good idea months ago
ofaas: im so weary of these doctors giving economic forecasts while comparing them to their worst case models
Protoxus: lolzmaster99 Pretty much nothing, for the first month of it
Santiago_LHC: Lockdown keeps the medical care system from saturating. That's when people who shouldn't die, start dying of stupid reasons like lack of respirators available.
lolzmaster99: Discipline is the difference
Abnico: authoritarian countries #1
DeeboMC: Yea I don’t think Sweden’s case is applicable tho
ahahahaitslit: i've heard from actual swedes that the lockdwon is still basically self imposed amongst the people
kayoeyumisaolegais: !time
DeeboMC: Apples to oranges
yogi_1010: what about the non-covid patients it saved? Because the hospitals did not get flooded with all the +45 yolds
ahahahaitslit: like it's not government mandates but still
balloonpopa: Haha
ggtom: Santiago_LHC i think that the main reason for lockdown. otherwise, the hospitals get stressed and u make decision of who to let die.

kevin21071: the spread out the seating in restaurants, etc
kevin21071: they*
nihonzera: @Santiago_LHC the thing was the Olympics: they tried to keep fewer tests to keep a low number to try to keep the event going
Protoxus: @Faceless_Bard I think balance risk-minimizing without compromising the economy - and especially not taking "risk-minimizing" to extreme levels that don't really work that efficiently.
Major_Spicy: Did you get far with the Muzero thing today?
Thotshotgg: It is really depressing to hear college campuses and other schools talking about remaining virtual into the fall semester.

DeeboMC: How many airports are in Sweden vs USA tho
jmp0ut: you know
DecayingSkullz: I wonder what the new normal will be after this is all over
socialnotsocial: Do you worry about engineered pathogens?
lolzmaster99: People are pointing to the relatively low public health impact in the country as evidence that the lockdowns were unecesry
jmp0ut: china was working on broadspectrum antivirals a year prior to COVID-19
asselbergs: The French are fumbeling this worse than the USA even. The lockdown there is brutal.
Nussinov: will anyone learn their lesson?
skinnypuppy69: isnt the corona virus suspect for being engineered
lolzmaster99: But the lockdowns made the lowimpact possible
Turtle_L9: bro my brain gets tired after 2 hours of coding how you do it for hours straight?
l1ght5p33d: Engineered pathogen ::: poison dart frog on a stick
jmp0ut: @socialnotsocial the militaries of the world were concerned with the research on broadspectrum antivirals

skinnypuppy69: we got lucky that it was a stupidly insignificant epidemic and not a actually threatening one, gives us good practice
AppleGrape: link for this?
lolzmaster99: I mean the volume of the transport
balloonpopa: just the first want right now
MrSheepe_: What do you think about US lockdown compared to South Africa's lockdown?
malledive: @pizzashotgun It might be even higher. Most people aren't tested post-mortem
kevin21071: yeah the hospitals where I live let a ton of people go
jmp0ut: why is the U.S. so oversaturated with virals
DeeboMC: Seattle?
Protoxus: I agree @skinnypuppy69.
calcmath: bodies in streets in ecuador
Thotshotgg: I think older folks should continue to isolate. But people need to get back to work and kids need to get back in school.
pizzashotgun: @malledive and it probably does permanent damage to the lungs
jmp0ut: is india and china worse?
balloonpopa: just the first wave right now
skinnypuppy69: thank you @Protoxus
THX1342: just wait to watch souther hemisphere winter....
WiseSwift: Wasn’t it the New York lockdown that contributed to that

tripcloth: 5g airpods cause coronacancer u heard it here first

Santiago_LHC: Why does every single epidemiologist say different then?
Ayowayway: we could not know the otherwise
balloonpopa: it is a matter of exposure over time and how the body reacts over time
lolzmaster99: But that's in hindsight. We didn't know the dynamics
lolzmaster99: at first

Mint2bSpiced: A differential equation is an equation which contains one or more terms which involve the derivatives of one variable (i.e., dependent variable) with respect to the other variable (i.e., independent variable) dy/dx = f(x) Here “x” is an independent variable and “y” is a dependent variable. For example, dy/dx = 5x.

blackskill224: here come detergent eating followers
Deno_____: hey thats illegal
williami000: Has he been streaming all night
ohG_Rivenroth: the population's education plays a big role too, no one talks about south korea, where the population is already educated to use masks even if they have a minor cold
l1ght5p33d: who uses mathematica?
Denis0109: don't be rude jessefive, you will learn something from him, instead saying bullshit.
maxschneider96: The US healthcare system is not performing well given that they spend more than 15% of their GDP on it, it´ s a lot compared to other countries.

niceonesonny77: what is he working on right now? Was Muzero like alpha zero?
hurzg: thanks @georgehotz
nejintejag: I don't think Sweden was so much better prepared. Sweden is a very individualistic society people are very isolated to begin with. Not that that is the main reason why Sweden is doing ok. I think the main reason is just how media portrays the hole thing.
rudolphdoesgames: @jagger_rsw or you could turn your volume op
rudolphdoesgames: up*
niceonesonny77: can anyone be kind enough to explain what he is doing??
ironickilla: u got a nice little apartment there
ironickilla: looks clean
JackiePuppet: Swedish people stay 2m away from each other even before the virus
markov010: Sounds like you forgot a coin on a pants
knitler_: I'm confused how you'd stop an inf recursion when doing tree search's on value itself
jagger_rsw: @rudolphdoesgames than "aaanything else" will be 3x too loud :)
deepfrieddeals: What’s that noise? Is George laundering his jeans?
l1ght5p33d: Anyone done Generalized Fourier Series for solving for DEs? That's about where I failed out of college
MrVitoDayz: basically, from my personal experience: governments do not put enough resources into healthcare. It's like throttling a CPU without a fan.
blackskill224: George what do you think of an GPU based SQL dialect? I wonder why is there no Database B trees running on parralell
Foxboron: @nejintejag Sweden is not doing OK. Look at Norway. Sweden also doesn't have the economy to do a complete lockdown.
rudolphdoesgames: @jagger_rsw for example, desktop audio down, twitch up, gotta play with those values and find the right balance
johngeorgesample: johngeorgesample subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
ohG_Rivenroth: @georgehotz any plans on making a online course or something like that?

l1ght5p33d: just bullshit the entire time like everyone else!
namenamison: Make a course on how to think then?
JaeGeeTee: JaeGeeTee subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
ironickilla: Think people, Think
pepelaugh0: @georgehotz do you watch tv at all?
cazklol: have not learned a shit since watching this channel
maxschneider96: Austria and Germany had good strategies, the death rates are really low and in austria they reopen shops again every 2 weeks. They will even allow tourism in summer probably.
whichtom: buy more ice
eldac_kno: online course on rapping
markov010: sounds like you forgot multiples coins on your pants

kristobalxx: LUL
markov010: More Money = More GPUs
maxschneider96: rich dad, poor dad, great book
ohG_Rivenroth: more like a mil, not 100k LUL
hurzg: be the next elon musk
Deno_____: charity?
FusRoDead: Wouldn't a course get more people to think?
nejintejag: @Foxboron I think Sweden is dong fine and doing a full lockdown is completely unnecessary. The mortality of covid is so much lower than the original estimates. Covid is just not that dangerous.
yungtoad1: only people with lots of money say stuff like this
bambiofthewoodtribe: Jet skis
eldac_kno: money can solve any problem money can solve
jagger_rsw: unless musk gets into jet ski business and it'll become cool
JaeGeeTee: you don't need a lot of money. you need enough money for food, a house, and thots!!!!!!!!!

MrVitoDayz: Invest that 100k, make 1 tril then your voice will be heard and you can teach people to think :D
Deno_____: THANKS IM POOR NO MORE
jwlolol: problems money cant solve are the real problems tho
St47ik: A course about thinking 4Head

aminuuux: poeple that buy course don't think
l1ght5p33d: Let's sue somebody that would be fun... better than protesting
huntboom: Pay people to color HahaThink
Joooooooooonas: do you have your own house/apartment ?
bovine_shield: Its about making enough, but not an excessive amount.
sakshambhutani2001: what bout Yatch, perhaps Private Jet?
gigafact: you can live off twitch if you like
LaramsZ: you can have economic stability and dont worry about it at all, being too rich doesn't give u that much
Foxboron: @nejintejag You are wrong. We know very little of how COVID affects us.
tinkerzwhothe_t: what's the purpose of living?
Deno_____: MODERATE
kristobalxx: not a jet ski
Deno_____: define moderate
alameda13: u want little
maxschneider96: everything u need to know about money and happiness: https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/
JaeGeeTee: Money can either attract the thots or keep them away!
Denis0109: But some people will never think, also if they try george. Sometimes it's better to not know, that people aren't THINKING.
clicclic_boom: @georgehotz what about the cult?
grenaderaven: buying lots of cheap crap is pointless, bt there are nice things that can improve ur life
TheKoreanZombi: @Deno_____ He defined moderate as $78k.
colanzio5: @georgehotz It's easy to think, it's harder to finish something to completion than come up with a good idea.
blackskill224: smoke weed with elon in escape velocity
Deno_____: ohh ok
Jehhred: Why get rich when you can be friends with rich people. You get all the benefits without the hassle
raystriker98: in California 78k is moderate
hurzg: the more you have, the more you fear loosing it all... thats the problem
tkdboy555: @georgehotz have you been to Stephen Wolfram's livestream at all these past few weeks? He launched this new open-source project https://www.wolframphysics.org/ for everyone to work on trying to discover the fundemental theory of everything, the grand unified theory of physics
eldac_kno: you wouldnt need excuse to suprass your true desires by pretending "i can buy whatever i want"
MrVitoDayz: well, we currently do not have an economic equivalent to money.
nejintejag: @Foxboron the numbers I have seen puts the mortality across the society is about 0.15 %.
l1ght5p33d: all hail elon.. stress king
LaheyFPS: elon doesnt feel stress
Deno_____: you make at least 130
grenaderaven: money buys power
YOLOMAN1343: when is the next geohot live concert where can i buy the tickets
Mobius5: If money is your core drive in life it's over for you
namenamison: What part of streaming gives pleasure, bc it seems like most of us only annoy you?
alameda13: but u could others with more money @georgehotz
Foxboron: @nejintejag And that is "not that dangerous" in your mind? The current deaths in sweden i 4 times that of last flue season.
技術宅: if you can eat you're good
lebop: iBUYPOWER
St47ik: https://www.wolframphysics.org/ seems interesting
Deno_____: you could buy a private island and host mma events
MrVitoDayz: @Mobius5 for some people it is tho.
技術宅: and medical
clicclic_boom: Are you still paid at comma?
whichtom: thats kinda a weird generalization for the entire country
FargioFarmani: If you feel stressed, can I give you a massage? @georgehotz
warriorgiggles: What part of streaming gives pleasure, bc it seems like most of us only annoy you?
sakshambhutani2001: money CAN give you more Credibility/ Social Influence.
namenamison: What part of streaming gives pleasure, bc it seems like most of us only annoy you?
Jehhred: Keeping in mind he earns 78K working part-time
JackiePuppet: That graph shows the average case, no guarentee that even slightly represents one's own case
alameda13: earn more help more
eldac_kno: i think notch situation seems perfect
Joooooooooonas: more money is a preparation for well being I think
d3adb33: but its Up to the country you live. ...
joseanavarrom: But for some people it’s not enough money for “what they want to buy”
this_is_falcon: part time 78k?
knilecrack: it just means you can't talk shit on twitter etc
grenaderaven: not having a boss is prolly more important to me than money
Mobius5: @MrVitoDayz I find it unbelievable how those people can get fullfilment in life. If you can already buy everything, why would you want more?
jagger_rsw: @georgehotz I'm not sure, if I earned 80k$ I'd be a bit worried about taking mortgage for a house in BayArea or in Switzerland where I now live.
yungtoad1: you're already a thought leaders. just read the dumb questions people ask
tkdboy555: check out https://www.wolframphysics.org/
great_said: do you thinj python still worth to learn?
sakshambhutani2001: I everything elon is, is because of his social influence
Shelledlizard4: id rather have time than money tbh
whichtom: mortgages are a scam
rudolphdoesgames: @great_said learning is always good so yeah! go for it
blackskill224: but guys... that is just a number... like who the fuck cares... tbh if I get respect for contributing to something cool and can eat food and sleep under the roof.
bovine_shield: LOL
gingersniffer: i make £23k and im perfectly happy, maybe im not intelligent enough to understand how i could be happier, but i think that mo' money = mo' problems is true
ggtom: michigan kek
jagger_rsw: @georgehotz that's why I live in switzerland :)
funwayz: no thanks
Denis0109: I wanna learn how to be smart: George: THINK, JUST START TO THINK!
Deno_____: depends on where you live
takkat14: what do you think about WANN?
grizvok: @gingersniffer no it isn;t
St47ik: @georgehotz lockdown made chat a bit worse?
tkdboy555: @georgehotz have you seen this? https://www.wolframphysics.org/
MDIronsTwitch: Ouch, Boston is up there too :(
d3adb33: i am Happy to be in EU 😎
whichtom: 23k is like starting salary out of undergrad in UK
this_is_falcon: but the ocean is cool
Joooooooooonas: BUT if you have enough money, it doesnt matter if the ratio is bad
blackskill224: but if you wanna do coke and bang thots. you need more
LaramsZ: Do you do this everyday duuud
SlaterUSA: has our man cured covid yet
MrVitoDayz: @whichtom lol, for phd stipen you get like 15k so... :D
phrixus_bro: stephen wolfram has done it again
joseanavarrom: In the EU is lower
Deno_____: @blackskill224 hey this isnt sillicone valley
jagger_rsw: @eldac_kno for housing not thaaat true, in comparison to BA. Say 1000sq ft house is maybe 800k USD in Zurich, which is probably less than in BA
knitler_: Is there a way to remove the reward completely for chess since it's not really needed?
whichtom: @MrVitoDayz in the UK?
whichtom: I knew they were low but not that low
FargioFarmani: btw your talk about hacking the world simulation was cool, i wonder how many ppl in the audience got the idea soulshined
whichtom: as usual, salary is a joke in the UK lol
MrVitoDayz: @whichtom Yup.
sakshambhutani2001: everything Elon is, is because of social influence
pepelaugh0: @georgehotz would you ever go on a podcast like eric weinsteins or lex fridmans if they asked?
joseanavarrom: It’s even lower in most of europe
l1ght5p33d: Eric Weinstein knows the next steps of testing string theory
grenaderaven: its not low in London
ak0ya_: string theory is math
joseanavarrom: It’s about welfare state
ak0ya_: not physics
LaramsZ: do you do this everyday
great_said: you deserve more thank Elon Musk for me
bambiofthewoodtribe: Buy houses in Nevada
MrVitoDayz: you do what you love but you struggle af. I don't care that much tho.

tkdboy555: thanks for checking it out :)
maxschneider96: @grenaderaven ain´ t that high in many fields as well
blackskill224: id like George on joe rogan... but i bet people said this a milion times
namenamison: @georgehotz If you are not that interested in money, why are your videos subs only?
aiex42: Wolfram project is NOT string theory
yungtoad1: PunchTrees
Deno_____: joe rogan only accepts atheists on his show
tkdboy555: @aiex42 true LP
grenaderaven: if ur earning low in london its prolly your own fault, theres devs with 1-2 years experience earning 60k
tkdboy555: @aiex42 :P *
grizvok: @namenamison literally all of this gets posted to the commaai youtube rofl
rudolphdoesgames: @aiex42 he didnt say it was?
huntboom: What’s your favorite linux distro and why?
jaxotp: Would you like to go to JRE? Sorry if this gets asked a lot, I'm quite new here.
whichtom: SE in london can get you a lot yea, I have a mate getting 100k freelancing
JaeGeeTee: HAPPY SUNDAY! WOOOOOO :rickflair:
WillGreen98: @grenaderaven hopefully so haha
whichtom: but for engineering as a whole, its really low
Deno_____: joe rogan is braindead
ggtom: joe 🅱️ ogan
maxschneider96: @grenaderaven ain ´t that much compared to other countries
aaddrr: london life is expensive af
nejintejag: @Foxboron so normally 250 people die each day in Sweden. Currently about 48 people die in covid every day in Sweden the overlap with those 250 is high. The people who die are mostly old and unfit people that would die from other causes son enough. For amount of work we put in to this covid shit we could save millions and millions of poor African people.
whichtom: im aerospace and my mates are getting like <25k starting salary and its depressing
blackskill224: no man he is not. he eat yelk and jalapenos. and smokes weed. that means he is smart
grizvok: you talking shit about rogan
ggtom: whichtom where?
whichtom: even then you cant get huge raises unless you go into management
great_said: i hate this virus, so depressing NotLikeThis
namenamison: @grizvok shit my bad dude, still weird that they are not free here but yeah mb
Deno_____: does dmt and thinks he knows how the universe is created
JaeGeeTee: @nejintejag, everyone is dead in sweden.. they sold their soul to the govn't
l1ght5p33d: @eldac_kno Why do you say he's a fraud? He at least knows almost what he's talking about enough to deceive very well then.. very sad if true
whichtom: @ggtom south of london
whichtom: not central, near greater
namenamison: But it is not one life
ggtom: whichtom in aerospace engineering? brutal ngl tbh but makes sense
sAfEgUy1: we could of done that before the virus though
maxschneider96: @whichtom I´ m living in north london, tottenham
paranon1: Have you read Marc Andreessen's "IT'S TIME TO BUILD" essay?
qcDENNEMANN: How hot is karen?
St47ik: @georgehotz to be fair this crisis revealed how broken the current global system is imo
Deno_____: theres people dying from fake boobs
AugTV: a thing we will look back on in the future, how the fuck did they have people starving and being homeless when they clearly had enough.
mibressler: When are you gonna go on Lex Friedman's Discord?
ggtom: man ppl need to make tl dr
whichtom: yea idk aerospace engineering in the UK makes me sad. trying to get to the US
LelouchViMoscow: Hey chat. Just broke up with my gf and come here :P
easysleeep: How about Daniel Gross’s piece on World 2.0?
blackskill224: @lelouchvimoscow nice. now go and jailbreak some phones
whichtom: we're still in the pandemic so we're operating on so much incomplete information
clicclic_boom: Food shortage is not really killing anyone these days. It’s mostly disease and war.
gasman1017: @LelouchViMoscow Sorry to hear that. Did you break up with her? That's at least a little better
ggtom: whichtom wat about mainland europe like germany? u can always do petro engineering
ak0ya_: @LelouchViMoscow thank you for letting us know
whichtom: @ggtom I aint selling my soul
Deno_____: bill gates is our lord savior Kappa
jagger_rsw: probably true in conflict regions, south sudan, somalia
ggtom: whichtom ???
whichtom: aerospace industry in the US is the best anyways
l1ght5p33d: If you live in the middle of nowhere you can obviously die pretty easily
St47ik: Whats that noise WutFace
clicclic_boom: Yup
LelouchViMoscow: @gasman1017 now, she said something like 'its hard to work etc, she just wanna find someone who had money'. kinda 5 years goes to trash
Deno_____: bill gates making vaccines and his children arent vaccinated
kingvoneduard: Young people are dumb and leftists
tribegvng: Everything a scam
mibressler: ggtom germany just has next to accurate numbers by good testing
tearisten68: I don't hear people complaining about starving yet, I hear about people complaining about their hair cuts
ggtom: petro eng is legit especially the drilling part
LelouchViMoscow: @gasman1017 i mean "no", not now
LelouchViMoscow: ahahha
sakshambhutani2001: Covid death is not only matter of age, it can be a matter of time you are exposed to it. Many young Doctors and Nurses are dying of Covid
St47ik: @Deno_____ pls stop
MrVitoDayz: I personally see the hospitals inside ( I work on there) so you can't suddenly increase the hospital's capacity by 10 fold... It takes at least some time and most importantly, you need the professionals working there. How will you get 10x support staff than what you normally need? So basically, overstreched hospital = declining healthcare.
this_is_falcon: its just circle of life
Deno_____: @st47ik whats wrong?
MrVitoDayz: And then what you get is that it's impossibelto get healthcare support for simple things like infection. So people start to die from stupid things.
aaddrr: trueee
ggtom: mibressler i was talking about aerospace eng jobs in germany lul
gasman1017: @LelouchViMoscow You will be ok. It sucks at first, but it get's better everyday. Just find stuff to do to keep yourself occupied. You deserve better my friend <3 <3 <3
whichtom: the idea of a mortgage is a scam anyway that drives up prices and screws over the next batch of people buying
mibressler: LoL haha
kingvoneduard: Harvard is a scam to make billions
MrVitoDayz: that is true.
mibressler: harvardx is nice though
MrVitoDayz: They are not scam, but are stuck in the past like most universities.
clicclic_boom: Mostly PPE and testing kits are widely available - not a technology problem. But govt gives licenses to sell these - there was a shortage of licensed products in the market.
Deno_____: harvard is pro slavery
Choruptian: what are you doing with MuZero?
benzojamal: we need a new democracy
gasman1017: Jim Gates says we aren't going to Mars for at least 100 years
LelouchViMoscow: @gasman1017 ty bro :) so it was really heartache first time)
benzojamal: democracy 2.0
sakshambhutani2001: Covid death is not only matter of age, it can be a matter of time you are exposed to it. Many young fit doctors and nurses are dying of covid
aiex42: You NEED to take a serious look into the Wolfram Physics Project: it's about hacking the Universe (simulation) to find the underlying rule behind it all
l1ght5p33d: Robots only on mars at least 40 years
tessier_ashp00l: how hard is going to mars compared to fixing eaarth?
triple__m: Really sucks how short sighted and biased people are, thinking mars is a destination and not about all the things we'll be inventing by setting the goal
Deno_____: yeah but george who created the people that created the matrix whos at the end of the creation chain
whichtom: musk is doing a good job of getting people excited/optimistic
kingvoneduard: You cannot hack a Simulation if you are inside.
ariasteve: Cheers from Canada 🇨🇦 Just found out about these streams, they’re awesome man
tribegvng: :D
lebop: what are your thoughts on VCs in silicon valley?
ak0ya_: This brings us back to protein folding?
l1ght5p33d: Brain is so sub optimal,, 99% recursive lock all the time
benzojamal: people should give up the idea of colonizing mars; it's complete waste of resources
gigafact: brains are amazing
Andrewnagyy: What's a terra flop?
whichtom: ya brains are an incredible piece of engineering
gasman1017: Jim Gates is a string theory guy. He says its an economical problem. When we went to the moon it took 10years and 5% of our year GDP. To Mars it's 100x that, so the math says it's not feasible right now
FargioFarmani: Computers are just rocks which we tricked into thinking
whichtom: lmao what
aaddrr: do you think we will ever mike a ezact functional replica of the brain but wihout the drawbacks of being human?
mibressler: hopefully not repetitive: when will you go on Lex Fridman Discord?
clicclic_boom: What do you think about DNA computing?
MurdocLIVE: Anyone see the new Microsoft patent for cryptocurrency microchip with patent number 060606?
MatiGoG: @Andrewnagyy floating point operations per second,
whichtom: going to mars is v different than going to the moon
sakshambhutani2001: what if we don't work toward increasing compute power but to hack brain
aiex42: Bro, you haven't looked into Wolfram Physics Project... it's not what you think it is
kristobalxx: what is the single most important thing that you look for in people when you hire ? especially for swe
Andrewnagyy: @MatiGoG Thanks
whichtom: mars might actually be easier now than going to the moon in the 60s/70s
whichtom: given how much innovation needed to occur then, and how much was unknown
benzojamal: like string theory LUL
gigafact: Elon is going to bring us to Mars
joseanavarrom: What are your thoughts on bill gates’ opinions about the pandemic?
MrVitoDayz: @MurdocLIVE lol thanks for showing.
StapoTV: curing ageing > mars
l1ght5p33d: @MurdocLIVE TIL Microsoft owns the devil's patent
gasman1017: The problem is our rocket technology hasn't evolved that much since the 60/70's. We're still using bell nozzles
Deno_____: george simulation is possibility but just because its possible doesnt mean its the most probable
whichtom: musk might bring us to mars but his biggest impact will be inspiring people after him
whichtom: so if he doesn't, there will be people after him
Deno_____: bill gates sterilizing africans
MurdocLIVE: @MrVitoDayz @l1ght5p33d Crazy right?! I'm not big into religion, but I do remember seeing something about mark of the beast going in your hand or something
aaddrr: bill gates is washed lul
GandalfTheGrayOfHell: @georgehotz One minute explanation of Monte carlo
calcmath: what did I miss, how long has he been streaming?
tessier_ashp00l: whitney weeb thinks otherwise
l1ght5p33d: lock up Microsoft . No more Microsoft for anyone
whichtom: @gasman1017 because they're good. aerospikes are still pretty w/e. the rocket tech isn't even the bottleneck
mibressler: will you go on Lex Fridman's Disc?
l1ght5p33d: port all Microsoft apps to Linux
kingvoneduard: Bill Gates will save us with a chip in our head.
l1ght5p33d: on a usb
Andrewnagyy: Bill Gates is funding as many researches as he can so he can be the first to come up with a vaccine and then patent it
MrVitoDayz: @MurdocLIVE LOL.
FargioFarmani: There is no strive for innovation anymore. The cold war is over.
Avelansh: what do you think of dan carlin's hardcore history podcast?
huntboom: Didn’t Bill Gates eradicate polio in India? He’s done a lot of good
whichtom: SSTOs are still highly unfeasible and will be for a long time. innovations need to occur for the interplanetary spacecraft, not the launch vehicle itself
gindalf: @chat what is he doing?
whichtom: and obv landing/ascent vehicles on the other planet
qcDENNEMANN: So what are we making?
MrVitoDayz: @gindalf figuring out muzero
whichtom: its largely a money problem, but its really a motivation problem
whichtom: I agree we don't need SSTO
LelouchViMoscow: Anyone have some experience in combined text and image analysis? I work at course work, so I have 10000 profiles of users with text and images data from open sources like insta/facebook, and i need to predict does some content would be liked by user
Deno_____: george my dad created the simulation hes letting me play with you guys right now
smokyandthebandito: dudes sleeping on a one inch matress, gonna have back problems in like a year LUL
Deno_____: do you have any questions
ariasteve: Do you recommend any books to get into Machine Learning?
gigafact: George is pioneering Science & Technology on twitch. It's the only stream about Science & Technology on twitch with any real view numbers
ohG_Rivenroth: george, what's your view on god/metaphysics?
braininavatt: monkaS asking about books
xeeton: funny how that "pseudocode" is actual code
Deno_____: @ohg_rivenroth hes a skeptic
eldac_kno: math theories doesnt need testability, but it is still science
huntboom: Does George have a favorite book?
Deno_____: imagine being an atheist yikes
ggtom: imo actual code can be considered pseudocode
Santytopa73: time online ?
3even: !uptime
a_0__0_a: my internet is crappy, so I am seeing Frodo writing code.
mibressler: math is like philosophy since it doesn't need any emprical observation
eldac_kno: you better time out deno__ he is spammingn stupid shit all stream
gigafact: @Santytopa73 about 1 hour
kito__: up time is 1:08
eldac_kno: math is still science though
niceonesonny77: pseudocode is an actual thing, that's one of the first thing we learn when we take Computer Science Principles in high school.
rudolphdoesgames: @eldac_kno agreed
nitropiece: math is not science
eldac_kno: yeah right
mibressler: Math doesn't tell you anything about the world
gindalf: math was invented by "them" to control the masses. look it up guys, open your minds
filip9i: What is he currently doing?
niceonesonny77: what is he currently doing
eldac_kno: math tells almost everything about the world, but not in the way you think
Deno_____: science can tell us how but it cant tell us why
Skurt2k: hi
maxschneider96: Mathematics is not a science from our point of view, in the sense that it is not a natural science. The test of its validity is not experiment - Richard Feynman
mibressler: science may use math to describe/approximate the world

joseanavarrom: Math is a tool for science
Deno_____: exactly
niceonesonny77: but without math, no science
gindalf: !github
eldac_kno: feynman isn't some godly authority on what is science
gubbdump262: what is George building
nitropiece: science is the observation and recording of repeatable phenomena while math is purely just a language that happens to be used by science
justenpassant: what are we doing today guys, I see Tensorflow
benzojamal: math is the only thing that matters
gasman1017: @whichtom but we can control thrust with other types of nozzle, reducing need for as much fuel.. therefore reducing price/lb to orbit. I'm not a rocket scientist, but makes sense to me
mibressler: without math science would be just less efficient
eldac_kno: math is also observation
calcmath: he is implemeting monte carlo tree search
mibressler: why is math observation?
joseanavarrom: Science is the only thing that matters, and math is a requirement. That’s it, they’re both important
bovine_shield: math is stupid. only painting and poetry matters.
her3hero: yo whaddup
nitropiece: math is not observation
ggtom: looks like he is doing some reinforcement learning thingy magig
eldac_kno: you observe things then use math to describe them
nitropiece: look up definition
justenpassant: math is an observation? lol. It's a modelisation
Mlewii: @eldac_kno so is math science ?
mibressler: eldac exactly, but it is not mathematics itself that your learning about
whichtom: @gasman1017 yeah but convergent-divergent just happen to work really well. If anything we could look into different types of chemical fuel but its a marginal performance increase
luuwa_: i think yes
gasman1017: how important do you guys think advanced math is for everyday programming?
ggtom: gasman1017 not important imo
Deno_____: you dont need math for programming but you need programming for math
ak0ya_: depends what advanced means
whichtom: reusability seems to be good, with high launch cadence. combined with better long-term space propulsion (really need nuclear imo) would be good
eldac_kno: depends on what programming
ggtom: gasman1017 youll rarely need beyond linear algebra
maxschneider96: Why don´ t u guys just google it, clearly gives u an explanation for why math is not a science. Annoying discussion haha
benzojamal: @gasman1017 you don't need it

M0NKEYBAGZ: what is MuZero
Izimoney92100: stop breaking it :(
ggtom: looking good there
Deno_____: ( . )Y( . ) this is for you george boy
brisingr1031: @M0NKEYBAGZ a model that deep mind released a paper on recently
FargioFarmani: It performed even better than AlphaZero in go and chess
qdl_: is google really to much for you people?
M0NKEYBAGZ: ahh
calcmath: this is still without UCB exploration
brisingr1031: @qdl_ whats google??
qdl_: idk lol isnt that these android guys?
whichtom: ah I see yea it matches/outperforms alphazero. neat
danrod43: @jomkingal take it easy with the compliments, this is your finla warning
l1ght5p33d: if you try to tune the weight update for only specific inputs .. Is that considered a hidden layer? I don't get the terminology sometimes
danrod43: @jomkingal good, stick to advice questions
brisingr1031: @georgehotz have you tried julia before?
calcmath: so this is brute force search, like a tree traversal
Izimoney92100: are we hearing the dryer in the background?
calcmath: policy should be combination of value and visit counts
brisingr1031: @Izimoney92100 p sure yeah lol
l1ght5p33d: map of state to action
Sycto: lol

eldac_kno: deno stfu aready
r3mote: Hello :)
danrod43: @eldac_kno LuL welcome back
FargioFarmani: Says the guy who got timed out
calcmath: policy is not stochastic i think, its just choose action with maximum UCB score
filipiek1997: i know :)
danrod43: he's a junior mod dude, he's working his way up
bill1929: @eldac_kno - pipe down bro you aint an authority figure

Deni1111: What desktop env do you use at work????
eldac_kno: what question about disposing body has anyting to do with this stream
csal90: Lets have some good vibes boys and girls

braininavatt: braininavatt subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! HeyGuys
calcmath: Also if you read the medium article, it says there are two phases, for first 30 moves its a different policy from after
maxschneider96: what´ are ur timeout policies?
M0NKEYBAGZ: ManChicken

BetaMalePaypig: trolling gets u timed out, i heard
Thomasbrah: @georgehotz what are you building today ?
Izimoney92100: a tree
St47ik: @calcmath why can't policy be stochastic as in stochastic policy gradients?
calcmath: look at fucntion visit_softmax_temperature
csal90: What's the benefit of using Jupyter notebooks?
eldac_kno: fast prototyping
calcmath: it can be stochasitc, its just that after 30 moves the way they implemented it is it just chooses action with maximum visits
l1ght5p33d: @maxschneider96 You must at least attempt to contribute positively to the intellectual quality of the chat
Boza7777: When did the stream start
maxschneider96: @l1ght5p33d makes sense
whichtom: about 2hr ago
kenan7: omg light mode
kenan7: my eyes hurt
l1ght5p33d: @csal90 not needing to type print()
calcmath: shouldnt you softmax with a temperature ?
andRoStyle: hi
cavad444mm: your voice is low @georgehotz
moizai: agree with you kenan 😂
l1ght5p33d: not needing to type esc shft : x uparrow tab enter
gigafact: making some pasta it's going to be nice
ggtom: calcmath i think they got a funky policy for action selection going on. doesnt seem to follow previous known policies. i gotta read the paper at some point. aka in a cpl of years
fychvhvjh: TALK ABOUT WHAT IF SOMEONE HACKED INTO THE PARTICKE ACCELERATOR
vrv_exe: @csal90 think of it as a vm. Environment is self contained. Easy to share with others.
fychvhvjh: PARTICLE
calcmath: @ggtom read the medium article, its explained better in there
Izimoney92100: it's broken :'(

lemonspree: What happened to the covid project?
anthonykwan: LUL
kalbermatteralan: SeemsGood
calcmath: exploring childs is based on UCB score, finally choosing the action for the real environemnt is based on visit counts
l1ght5p33d: @lemonspree We needed a mass spectrometer
maxschneider96: love python, but compared to other languages I find it harder to find bugs, honestly
calcmath: its the select_action function, they use a softmax with a temp
eaterenrgy: @maxschneider96 Use it strongly typed it helps a lot plus of errors are caught compile time.
l1ght5p33d: what's wrong looks good to me
xeeton: how are you finding the optimal hyperparams for muzero?
maxschneider96: @eaterenrgy thanks for the advice
triple__m: are people just trolling in chat? what's going on?
l1ght5p33d: @xeeton fancy maths or a metric ton of trials

xeeton: @l1ght5p33d I see, thx
Jazzify101: What kind of game is this thing tying to beat?
calcmath: is this cartpole or mountatin thing?
calcmath: game is just balancing the stick
Jazzify101: ok
FargioFarmani: The problem is that there is no continuity on the simplex w.r.t to the nodes.
nejintejag: @calcmath what stick?
gaocaandra: yoo wassup
calcmath: think inverted pendulum on a cart, cart nedds to move to keep it balanced
gaocaandra: 3 streams in 2 days
gaocaandra: blessed be
foosballs: thanks for the medium article - anyone interested on understanding what he is working on - check out the article, its very beginner friendly.
calcmath: he will show the animation of it eventually
l1ght5p33d: @Jazzify101 He already switched out the game a few times. The game doesn't matter if the inputs are the same data type. The algorithm will learn any game environment . Look at open ai gym
gaocaandra: where is the link?
lordmordi_: first time ive ever caught your stream live. might sound weird to say but I've been looking forward to this. lol

gingersniffer: i love these streams george, they inspire me to learn, thanks for sharing
knilecrack: Hey man, can you take a minute and explain what are you doing, I've missed a big part of the stream
Flying_Geese: can anyone tell me what he's making?
calcmath: shouldnt there be softmax with a temperature somewhere? or is this a simplifed version you are trying first?
foosballs: I'm just mindblown with the idea that you can train a network to learn without any rules.. although it does feel kind of intuitive that after throwing 1m games of understanding whats valid or invalid move at certain positions or representation - it creates a mapping of how to go about the game.
foosballs: Still fascinating shit nevertheless
gaocaandra: he is making a muzero implementation that works on "every" environment
gigafact: nom nom pasta is ready
nejintejag: What are the outputs, and what is the inputs measuring?
Flying_Geese: thanks for the update guys!
xeeton: can anyone not read the previous comments? jfc the same question is answered over and over
whichtom: wdym environment @gaocaandra
l1ght5p33d: @foosballs "no rules" what do you think all the coding is about
foosballs: Come again, didn't get your question
gaocaandra: you have agents that act inside environments (check out python package gym)
whichtom: oh the games
whichtom: im being stupid ya I know gym, just havent used it in forever
WarSwick: You have no emotes?
LaheyFPS: @xeeton people who join cant see previous comments
calcmath: as you visit it a lot the value score should get weighed down
WarSwick: For subs
calcmath: just try for more simulations to see its effect?
bichid69: bro why is nothing working for you on these streams anymore
calcmath: you need the vist count to build up to reduce weigh down effect of value

saintmthw: @Himdextermorgan are there ethical hacker careers in your country? look at those and work backwards from there to see what u have to do
bliutwo: that would be considered "hacking"
aacarm: those eggs are fine
lolzmaster99: @Himdextermorgan To be a "hacker" you need to know how things work (networking, web apps, etc.). Start with learning how to build those things, then when you understand you can come back and try to take them down back

Tuhafadam: how do you test it ? on gui ?
garydsmith1: can i be a mod?
Joooooooooonas: The problem is if you are upset, more people try to troll you (because they think its fun), it would be best if mods would just timeout those guys without you mentioning them, less people would try to troll and you would be more efficient

Penguino138: Is traditional SARS 3x flu too?

K1ngjulien_: more like 10x, but only if you 're old tbh
DeeboMC: Are you going to the protest just for something to do or because you think it will make a difference?

eldac_kno: yes, that's called education
csal90: so true lol
gaocaandra: do you think wolfram lang is what you meant when you said you wanted a mix between coq and python?

sakshambhutani2001: In most of the places, these are more of Trump Rallies
axlebear: PepeLaugh
poppingtonic: what's the protest really about?
yuptheladsdownthecans: @MrJeff_ you might not care but more vulneralble people do care
mangoxavier: Healthcare is a scam.
Penguino138: And Alex will probably be there

sakshambhutani2001: make America great again
garydsmith1: but if we drink bleach we will be safe
eldac_kno: don't you think when you go to a protest you are being used by people who benefit from it
Penguino138: @aldelecrane The only way geo is gonna get sick is if he forgets to wear his jacket when it rains
eldac_kno: any protest
maxschneider96: @joseanavarrom more than 230 companies out there using AI for drug discovery, it´ s already happening
michelfugain69: @Penguino138 LUL its true tho
mangoxavier: I’d like to see George argue with an anti-vax
MrJeff_: @yuptheladsdownthecans Best thing is, we don't have many people in my village. So we just keep calm and carry on.
pashafst: late to the party, what he's trying to make?
thelastkek: Protesting is beneficial, it builds herd immunity!!
lolzmaster99: bro its astroturfing!
spockshocks: its literally astroturfing
gaocaandra: kill off the weak ones
poppingtonic: @maxschneider96 yeah Insilico et al
DrakenZA: she could just be highly astroturfed and not even know it
foti_kasparov: Can we fuck the government by doing a walk?
yuptheladsdownthecans: @MrJeff_ so litreally nobody in your village leaves the village on a regular basis and comes into contact with other people? Seems very unlikely
spockshocks: all the reopen state facebook pages / websites were started by the same guy
DeeboMC: Oh yea, I’d be in if that’s the case
axlebear: surfing addict over here
sakshambhutani2001: fuck the government, but don't be dumb
joseanavarrom: @maxschneider96 and diagnostics
Penguino138: @georgehotz How hard is it gonna be to remove all the sand in the skate parks?
HopZe: Natural Selection boys
maxschneider96: @poppingtonic yeah
nejintejag: I think the 5G theories are fun. Completely insane but fun!
whichtom: protests have worked but not typically peaceful ones
thelastkek: Protesting is beneficial, it builds herd immunity!!.
geohot_pls_fck_me: god bless america
mayaeiouy: are you gonna stream from the protest @georgehotz
maxschneider96: @joseanavarrom I am developing a diagnostics device atm for my master´ s thesis. There is so much potential in that field
eldac_kno: i would protest twitch, if they banned this stream
mondeverest: do you livestream the protest?
thenomadplayer: what happened with 1 milion subs project on instagram?
niko174_: Lol dudes, I have April 27
DeeboMC: In for iconoclastic chicks
foti_kasparov: A walk a day keeps the government away !
IBaydenI: @georgehotz What is that wiggly thing going to be when its done?
sakshambhutani2001: How are you Doctors and Nurses dying? It's not just about age, it's about time you are exposed too
mangoxavier: That dude isn’t wiggling it’s humping.
ophicleidon: BibleThump
kaksoispistedeh: PepeHands
whichtom: the 2nd linkage is meant to get above the black line
axlebear: rip
jagger_rsw: are you trying to traing the chat by using some reward function (more streams if good chat)?
IBaydenI: @whichtom thanks :)
bovine_shield: Its also about the lung damage if you survive
Penguino138: How many other things in life have a 1/1000 chance to kills us? Probably a lot
garydsmith1: @jagger_rsw yes
HopZe: its called hibernation in nature language
joseanavarrom: But it's not kill us, it's kill our families for example
mayaeiouy: do you worry about the increased number of strokes seen in younger people who are covid positive
gaocaandra: you are good backgorund noise to work with, don't leave us.
mangoxavier: It’s literally a battle of your immune system holding out over the virus. Everyone has a diff immune system.
Penguino138: @mayaeiouy Where's the evidence?
whichtom: but people who are covid positive typically have underlying health conditions with themselves lead to a higher chance of strokes?
maxschneider96: @mangoxavier depends on your predisposition generally and the type of strain
whichtom: either way theres too little data for any conclusions
Penguino138: @mayaeiouy I'm almost positive you're references a fear mongering article that talked mostly about 40+ year old "young" people
thelastkek: look if yall want to stay locked up you do that. You cant force people to do the same
axlebear: Just stay inside like a good little citizen
GS540: LOL
whichtom: ya 'young' meaning 30-40 or something
l1ght5p33d: code snippets not allowed in chat?
niko174_: Ладно ребята, я пошел спать. Было приятно пообщаться. Good night <3
garydsmith1: StinkyCheese
eldac_kno: speaking of doctors possessing some extra knowledge after becoming doctors, it's more neccessary thing than sufficient, it's neccessary to have some medical education to make some claims, but not sufficient, imo
logi6000: yo
mayaeiouy: I said younger for a reason
Penguino138: Now I see why the chat has been bad again. Thinking article titles are science fact...
Kromtor: this guy the new hot reaction streamer? kek
eldac_kno: Monty Carlo
Digital_donger: TheIlluminati ?
nejintejag: @whichtom no everyone can get infected your health is irrelevant. Your health is related to the mortality of you get infected.
mayaeiouy: @penguino138 there’s also a medscape article
farlopote: kekers
logi6000: Simpson's stream?
thelastkek: Protesting is beneficial, it builds herd immunity!!
yungdeli_: Imao
Penguino138: @mayaeiouy An article that states 40-50 year olds are young to fear monger is not an article to read
garydsmith1: @thelastkek lol
bichid69: its about being bored
DeeboMC: When was that from?
un3okapi: George, you have a beautiful smile.
mayaeiouy: @penguino138 that’s like nearly half the age we usually see those stokes in
whichtom: again, theres too little data to draw any conclusions right now. when its over we'll have actual answers
zimslv: nerd immunity FTW
foti_kasparov: Then don't watch media
Kromtor: you're trapped in their scope
DeeboMC: Chomsky, cialdini
niko174_: Its like in Russia lmao
poppingtonic: the frame = the "overton window"
leonardssh22: hello geo
Penguino138: @mayaeiouy Yes those age groups may be at increased risk, but to say 40-50 year olds are young means you probably shouldn't read it
yungtoad1: read manufacturing consent by Chomsky it's all about this
whichtom: great book
mayaeiouy: @penguino138 says youngER
yungtoad1: yes great book
garydsmith1: india heavenly thinks corona is made by the Chinese
jagger_rsw: unsure if this follows, if someone says 'herd ummunity b/c of protest' you respond with 'yes, but at a risk of overcrowding hospitals'. Why I shouldn't buy into it?
l1ght5p33d: sue > protest
gigafact: so part 3 coming up later George? will be waiting for you here.
DeeboMC: Persuasion by Cialdini also
eldac_kno: would love to see programming in python in blender
poppingtonic: @yungtoad1 great book

Kromtor: said my GAN
Izimoney92100: lol
bovine_shield: All my stuff does to you, george
masters8: flawless logic
jagger_rsw: can you enumerate benefits to subscribers, esp. once you take over the world?
l1ght5p33d: ayy lmaaoo
ak0ya_: what about money>
robodemia: you sound like jordan peterson
eldac_kno: interested in blender? it uses python for scripting, you can make interesting stuff
DeeboMC: Damn son

CaliburOne: One of my best friends work in healthcare, its fucked out there. Hes doing 12 hour days every day in Florida.
chemicalflash: war on chat
qubitmanipulator: don't you trust anyone?
arakis_djall: what are your thoughts on chatbots?
braininavatt: ask him what he thinks about anarchism Kappa
Newlax: burn all the crypto
Vrookems: why not just donate your stuff to someone who would never want to kill you
nejintejag: @robodemia Explain.
Vrookems: like normal people

axlebear: 5Head
garydsmith1: @vrookems that person would want to kill you
jagger_rsw: anecdata
no_g: What if someone's motivated by burning all your shit? Then you're giving them an incentive to kill you monkaS
l1ght5p33d: thats the way
fireposeidoncx: My will is to see you on the JRE podcast
masters8: not always bruh
aPosterior: what a guy
Vrookems: @garydsmith1 my mother wouldnt kill me just to get my stuff
garydsmith1: @no_g but they will do it anyway
mangoxavier: They could still kill you for your stuff. They don’t need an easy out.
justenpassant: well it depends on if people in your will love you more than they wan to kill you. so you just want to estimate the amplitude of each one with a precision that satisfies you
luigivsf: covid is more media bulls* than reality. Id never know a close person who had that and told the entire story. Always is random people like reading a script to set some paranoia on people
yungdeli_: @fireposeidoncx yessssssssss
garydsmith1: @vrookems yeah, but you never know tho
gaocaandra: george on the portal would be nice
bovine_shield: IRON CLAAAAAD

sakshambhutani2001: why not drop money from helicopters?
logi6000: in philly all hospitals are overwhelmed they are doubling up people on 1 ventilator. nurses only get one mask per week
nejintejag: Gorge might not look good on JRE.
q4nt3r: some think that only "rich" individuals dying spawns people fighting over their stuff. I've seem families fight over a shitty 50 year old, not even running car.
l1ght5p33d: My apartment is so nice whatchu talkin bout
eldac_kno: speaking of Wolfram Physics, you said science need testability, but math doesn't have, but it's still science
fireposeidoncx: George you should talk to joe rogan
garydsmith1: i mean the BTK killer was a loving father
HopZe: what about other countries?
J3rwin: @georgehotz your streams are chill and cool man.
Vrookems: bombs cost money, drop them instead

sakshambhutani2001: and would have been cheaper!
Penguino138: Stream lagging for anyone else?
tauzN: washingtonpost.com/evidence-for-what-geohot-just-asked
joseanavarrom: The health system capacity here in spain was absolutely over-exceeded
eldac_kno: what kind of evidence do you need, can you define
mayaeiouy: what you consider valid evidence do I have to go snap a pic in an icu
yungtoad1: how do you know if a source is verifiable
J3rwin: @Penguino138 twitch having a blip
mangoxavier: Data
DeeboMC: Lack of evidence isn’t evidence of lack.. in general tho.
LaheyFPS: @Penguino138 yes, but briefly
garydsmith1: @eldac_kno basically statics with verifying it
waterpaste: what is good evidence for u ?
sakshambhutani2001: I mean who can you trust as a credible source Trump?
braininavatt: he trusts institutions :)
nejintejag: Hum media media it is just people in the end right...
l1ght5p33d: No one knows it's impossible truth is false

ytazn: No
xeeton: lol
joseanavarrom: It would hahaha
loouai: broo get a jupyter dark theme plsssssss
ytazn: Wtf is rust
gaocaandra: @ytazn how so
3minus2: @SHAVEYY_ what do you think of python? ive been told its "easy" to learn
l1ght5p33d: im trying to write follower from a blurry screenshot
neilsweb: What chair is that?
nsielicki: any experience with Julia?
bismarckbamfo: Darkmode.
DeeboMC: write that shit in cobol breh
ytazn: @gaocaandra you have some measure of fitness like positive feedback from your parents and you try random shit to trigger that
l1ght5p33d: how u get in pygame always bad shape shape alwayysss whyyyy
robonhansonem: We need a fizz buzz stream.
birkett0011: how do i install pandas
ytazn: That’s how these algorithms work without knowing the rukes
cod4_lightning: I mean what's the % of watchers that actually understand what you are doing?
SHAVEYY_: @3minus2 python is probably the go to for new programmers tbh
chrispickels: put an extra pole in the cart
chrispickels: one pole is too simple
mashafique: I don't think George streams to teach us. From what I remember he said the stream is about talking shit and being somewhat productive LUL
gaocaandra: yeah i understand the whole reward thing, what is confusing me is i thought that was the function that determined which node was visited next
skinnypuppy69: little to none @cod4_lightning
TheKoreanZombi: @cod4_lightning Why are you watching if you don't understand?
neilsweb: I didn't know jack dorsey streamed.
3minus2: hm ok, can you explain a super noob the differences between all these languages?
FrancescoTommaso: is it running a mcts and deciding what to do at everyframe?
chrispickels: one pole is a simpleton's game
gaocaandra: nevermind i'll look at the code later
vHyphy: vHyphy subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
ytazn: The only way to understand is try yourself
birkett0011: Have you guys seen any real world applications of RL? not just computer games ect?
vHyphy: My dad loves your shit
cod4_lightning: I mean I watch in the hope of learning more about programming by a professional programmer!
lolzmaster99: @birkett0011 Optimal control theory
info303: @birkett0011 it can be used for stocks, logistics, ton of applications
ytazn: @birkett0011 yeah eventually a car in a novel situation will be able to figure a solution de novo given it doesn’t destroy itself on the process
birkett0011: @lolzmaster99 anything more specific on the simulation side. So far my experience has been dismal for simulation
birkett0011: I work extensively in Anylogic simulaiton and it seem like a perfect match but havent seen any decent applications
vHyphy: How do I share my sub
3minus2: @SHAVEYY_ hm ok, can you explain a super noob the differences between all these languages?
nsielicki: what'd you change in select_child?
gaocaandra: make it rand between 0-1
loouai: @3minus2 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg4U4r_AgJU&t=1353s
gaocaandra: see what happens
skinnypuppy69: why does my professor tell me to make psuedo code but even george hotz doesnt make pseudo code
gaocaandra: the root has visit count
gaocaandra: in mcts
nsielicki: @skinnypuppy69 because the university education system is about making workers en masse, not making good workers.
cod4_lightning: @skinnypuppy69 cuz he is legend, and your professor is a noob!
chunks____: nah, they dont teach anything about being a good programmer in school
loouai: @nsielicki preach
ytazn: Your professor doesn’t have to write code that people use
gaocaandra: the first time it defaults to the first because uct = infinity for all nodes
skinnypuppy69: geez it was rhetorical lmaoi chill out
birkett0011: Any of you messed around with the #Hash simulation stuff? Seems like good place to apply some of this RL on more complex systems. https://hash.ai/index/search?contentType=Simulation&sort=dateModified
lolzmaster99: Yes
ytazn: Lmao my professors are dumb too
cod4_lightning: I subscribed now I am in the safe zone.
gaocaandra: because n = 0
gaocaandra: the second time the first node will have n = 1
skinnypuppy69: all professors are dumb, youtube is how you learn
gaocaandra: so it will go to the next
ytazn: @skinnypuppy69 true
DeeboMC: Most* professors
guinness84: have u tried gripping the handle differently, your slicing right a bit
ytazn: I prefer to read
skinnypuppy69: i learn by seeing not reading so kudos
gaocaandra: are you counting root visits? i think you should
nsielicki: introductors fundamentals classes aren't taught by the brightest, but if you're lucky your junior and senior classes will be taught by people as smart as george
DeeboMC: well then.. thats never gonna make you elite
ak0ya_: Cold it be that mcts not working is juts a symptom of a bug elsewhere?
ak0ya_: *could
ytazn: Yeah starting out I used videos to get more of the emotional vibes of what’s important
FiZdaWiz: bruh u are a genius
cod4_lightning: I subscribed geo. Show me your dotfiles LOL!

DeeboMC: he's isnt
Kawhiet: just throw more tpus at it

nsielicki: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pudIZbCRq_c
FrancescoTommaso: brute force way
MoTeMiB: !uptime
Pr0ject414: as obi one konobi once said... "throw all the tpus at it"
TheKoreanZombi: It is going for speed and accuracy
slayerdaniel: it just doesnt feel like it
cod4_lightning: do you watch streams other than yours?
searchingforlife: its trying its best
DeeboMC: @nsielicki lol
mik12f4: delete the ground
TheKoreanZombi: If the lander flips upside down and fires its thrusters so it crashes faster I will be happy.
DeeboMC: @Pr0ject414 great man, obi wan
Mariosavitch: its learned to die quicker
janpoonthong: What is your Mac spec?
nsielicki: he's got one of those new 16" mbp
Pr0ject414: @deebomc but obi one is the better man... he is number 1
cod4_lightning: @janpoonthong 13 macbook maxed out i think
DeeboMC: i see what you did there
janpoonthong: @cod4_lightning I see
node_storm: he has the new 16 inch i think
bulksquat_thrust: this was a bad stream to hop in the middle of huh
bulksquat_thrust: my small brain doesnt know whats happening
FangSkillz: hes coding
cod4_lightning: @bulksquat_thrust EXACTLY!
FangSkillz: but trying to make his custom spaceship to fire thrusters @bulksquat_thrust
janpoonthong: He use laptop to code?
FangSkillz: yeah
FangSkillz: i guess idk LUL
nsielicki: NOT BAD AT ALL
JeanFrag: does it always respawn close to the center? then any (alteration of angle)(power of truster) will likely push it away @georgehotz
cod4_lightning: He needs that Mac Pro
node_storm: making progress
FangSkillz: !spec
FangSkillz: !pc
bulksquat_thrust: ah
birkett0011: very smrt
sit_d: he's just a baby
FangSkillz: ^
costcospizza: true
janpoonthong: What he is doing now?
JeanFrag: I think you should randomize respawn zone, not in the center @georgehotz
janpoonthong: Creating game?
FangSkillz: waiting till model starts thrusters @janpoonthong
cod4_lightning: @georgehotz make a petereon so we can get you a mac pro maxed out with 1tb ram so you make us more top notch streams
DeeboMC: @cod4_lightning you cant be serious
Lana_Lux: @janpoonthong he's using MuZero to solve a game
FangSkillz: "@georgehotz make a petereon so we can get you a mac pro maxed out with 1tb ram so you make us more top notch streams" - @cod4_lightning
StopitDonk: ^
FangSkillz: i guess he doesn't have chat open LUL
JeanFrag: rip
cod4_lightning: @deebomc yes i am, he deserve that!
ytazn: Ok I installed it
DeeboMC: he can afford it if he wants it
bulksquat_thrust: what mac is he using?
l1ght5p33d: make observation learning
32bitrobo: twitchRaid
bulksquat_thrust: seems like its breathin hard
l1ght5p33d: f$@& keras tho what does concatenate even do
FangSkillz: twitchRaid
bubblesnot: @georgehotz how well is the comma two ADAS device selling?
nsielicki: stop asking about k3yb0@rd and his computer and whether he wants a mac pro, he's happy with his setup
DeeboMC: this guy gets it
cod4_lightning: anyone here coding along with him and trying to solve the problem with him?
l1ght5p33d: jk keras is good
FangSkillz: @nsielicki are you sure since he hasn't said anything
nsielicki: it's in the description as a bannable offense.
routerkicker: give it less reward when It's vertical velocity is high
FangSkillz: but we are just trying to help him so i don't know how this would be a ban offense
bulksquat_thrust: just wondering the hardware needed to run this faster lol
FangSkillz: ^
DeeboMC: i dont think you guys are even sycophants, you're just irrationally subservient and infatuated
Loutlot: Loutlot subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 2 months! 
JeanFrag: can you randomize the spawn point? @georgehotz
cod4_lightning: do you announce that you are going to stream about a specific topic before on discord, so we can have an idea and prepare?
DeeboMC: no
DeeboMC: i dont even know that as a fact i can just infer
info303: if it randomly explores maybe it just needs a lot more episodes?
ytazn: Does it know how to fire thrusters?
eeXecute: maybe it's getting rewarded to early jk idk
pokerpete555: I vote @JeanFrag idea
l1ght5p33d: manual input,, pipe state to history buffer
pokerpete555: whatever thats worth
fychvhvjh: you can take on big semi autonomous car comps they will have vegence on u
DeeboMC: i think its a good idea
badpartyhouse: Reverse the value for the down thrust
l1ght5p33d: or switch the sign of something
badpartyhouse: make the down thrust positive
badpartyhouse: see if it learns that way
bottonresult: !uptime
fychvhvjh: are you selling car data to the asians?
rudolphdoesgames: how was the protest?
ytazn: 1900 collect a bunch of employees run a company 2020 collect a bunch of packages run a company
JeanFrag: should i even try saying it again?
badpartyhouse: it is making the down thrust has such a negative value, just make it into a positive value and see what happens then???
cod4_lightning: how can i control a robot with an iOS app? what are the steps for doing that?
ytazn: Lunar lander?
l1ght5p33d: Parse the history and reverse the sign on everything
ytazn: Or tic tac toe?
DeeboMC: step one: locate a toys'r'us..
cod4_lightning: can you talk about your pwn2own experience?
l1ght5p33d: manual input good values
JeanFrag: can you randomize spawn point? @georgehotz
ytazn: Guys I’m at training step 20 of 10k
JeanFrag: yea
fychvhvjh: can you start an all girl coding class to promote equality
gaocaandra: yeah that makes sense
ytazn: Guys this is super fucking boring
ytazn: I have to wait for 100k ganes
l1ght5p33d: what
DeeboMC: @fychvhvjh primo shit lol
JeanFrag: right now it is not worth risky using thrusters when it gets better results not doing anything because it respawns in the center @georgehotz
ytazn: The model eats 100k games

abe8k: how often are you doing covid19 bio? joined twitch for it tbh
raystriker98: well they do have unlimited resources thanks to Google
sit_d: the details of their results are lackluster
bubblesnot: Ok np
l1ght5p33d: it's just sparse reward just move things and sink into different minimum no problem
TheKoreanZombi: @abe8k He is done with bio.
DeeboMC: "bio is over.." (portlandia, anyone?)
ytazn: Bad rewards still help tho?
FrancescoTommaso: maybe solve this with good and old q-learning or sarsa
gaocaandra: do what jeafrag said
ytazn: Bad rewards say don’t do that
nsielicki: so what's happening that it's approaching a solution and then getting thrown out? we need to do more math
gaocaandra: ok
FrancescoTommaso: Ok
JeanFrag: yes!
pokerpete555: yay Jean

AppleGrape: Integrating this into no limit texas hold em
raystriker98: colab free only gives you one single slow xeon core

DeeboMC: blackjack's way more likley
l1ght5p33d: know all the other players cards
pokerpete555: I'm playing the great game right now while watching
info303: why not see what happens if it runs for longer?
pokerpete555: holdem, not blackjack
routerkicker: maybe discount it still a bit too high?
DeeboMC: blackjack is solved tho
pokerpete555: yup
pokerpete555: ez
oversum: Think it's good practice for a programmer to have both Mac and Windows?
DeeboMC: windows is spyware confrimed, so theres that.. but otherwise yea
AppleGrape: I have both
l1ght5p33d: you want to do observation on poker i would think
AppleGrape: I prefer my mac for web dev
WhispyHerc: still working on cartpole?
l1ght5p33d: manually input state of chips and who wins
Pr0ject414: bit too high meaning go down in numbers closer to zero?
oversum: I mean I'm in my junior year of college for cybersec and I'm starting to see more and more mac stuff
DeeboMC: mac for work; linux for fun... altho george does the opposite
nsielicki: lol
ytazn: @deebomc I’m flipped too but I’ll get fired soon
oversum: savage
l1ght5p33d: need WPT logs
WhispyHerc: do be wiggling fast doe 😳
katrocitus: do you kaggle?
Pr0ject414: so a marked improvement after going down .01
Pr0ject414: or just luck
DeeboMC: @ytazn you want to get fired or you just anticipate it happening soon?
pokerpete555: @l1ght5p33d better to solve cash than tourney

knitler_: How is it stopping an infinite recursion through the tree?
DeeboMC: lol damn.. well with an realistic outlook like that, i think you'll do just fine
l1ght5p33d: make bin size of action and mostly use same action then smol random
nsielicki: :set paste
nsielicki: why does vim do that anyway?
DeeboMC: puts you ahead of, maybe, 80-90% people probably.. just give it time and keep perpetually improving
gaocaandra: 138
ytazn: What does Jupiter do?
swftdev: Jupiter is a notebook environment to write code in
nsielicki: the thing is the paper is about not knowing any of the rules, it shouldn't need to have this rule of the game exposed to it
l1ght5p33d: ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
swftdev: make code streams work again
l1ght5p33d: is spamming ascii llegal
gaocaandra: penalize it for not using thrusters
ytazn: @swftdev ty
shutchie: isn't the -100 crash?
gaocaandra: JAJAAJAAJJAJ
bulksquat_thrust: i need a programming project to save me from boredom but im not creative enough to figure one out myself
gaocaandra: join a cult
AppleGrape: There is so many possibilities.....
AppleGrape: use your brain man
be9ns: hes in the vim cult
badpartyhouse: this shit is broken
gaocaandra: how is that happening?
nsielicki: agh this is fucked
superluminal86: jupyter cult
routerkicker: maybe change discount back. idk man
gaocaandra: maybe it takes longer
FrancescoTommaso: increase punishment
JeanFrag: is there a cost to using thrusters/
Pr0ject414: -69 for not using it
gigafact: I still remember the stream when you said you did not want them to end in failure. We will ever make this work...
nsielicki: i think the strongest theory so far is that it just needs much more compute than we're throwing at it
JeanFrag: does the benefit of winning closer to the center outweigh the cost of using thrusters?
FrancescoTommaso: reduce loss of points for time to completion
gill_bates_macrosoft: @bulksquat_thrust I'm doing a few stuff here, except in rust https://github.com/rby90/Project-Based-Tutorials-in-C
be9ns: heard to talk to lex about Haskell, any projects besides a compiler?
WhispyHerc: wait so if using the thrusters is bad why do you want it to use the thrusters if it's finding ways to solve it without them
ytazn: This is like slapping the pilot when he messes up
ak0ya_: maybe mcts search?
shutchie: is the negative reward for using thrusters being overcome by a positive reward by getting closer to the surface? seems like the reward needs to be based on descent rate
swftdev: this is the existential moment where if it works or not might not matter..
info303: is the idea with muZero to discover the actions on it's own?
ytazn: Slapping the pilot seems like a great idea now
knitler_: seems like the reward would be much easier for chess/go
swftdev: sticks not carrots
Pr0ject414: im waiting for the tomcr00se music stream.
bulksquat_thrust: @gill_bates_macrosoft ive been doing stuff in c++ to get better at memory management
TheKoreanZombi: Doesn't the lander by default penalize thruster use or is the main engine different than thruster? "Firing main engine is -0.3 points each frame."
badpartyhouse: give it more reward if it keeps the time going
Iluvmf: LUL LUL LUL
node_storm: hahaha
WhispyHerc: LUL
gigafact: damn

TiPera: but girls. = ban right D: @mitrocc
DeeboMC: need moar montage music
justenpassant: how many learning iterations does this one need?
mitrocc: @TiPera Girls cant get banned on twitch FeelsGoodMan
c1tr0n75: cheer50
TiPera: @mitrocc true, 2020 twitch Kappa
TheKoreanZombi: @mitrocc I am just explaining to you why that word is bannable. Because people ask dumb questions about it.
mitrocc: @TheKoreanZombi Doesnt make sense , but his channel his rules
cod4_lightning: bro, i don't have a GF, let's build some AI girls
nsielicki: don't you dare restart that kernel

cod4_lightning: !uptime
mitrocc: @TiPera Twitch have some of the best athleats, World record for cat throwing Alinity. World record for most nip slips on stream -Alinity. 3 day ban CoolStoryBob
bubblesnot: How does it sense the yellow flags?
forkdb: May be he should dedicate one whole twitch stream to answer all the questions, so that there would be no more dumb questions....
info303: it gets a big reward when it lands below a certain downward velocity I think right? if I understand correctly it has to accidentally stumble upon that scenario
Kawhiet: @forkdb theres always new viewers
cod4_lightning: how long the stream is now?
DeeboMC: cat throwing summer league
TheKoreanZombi: @forkdb No, there are too many dumb questions. They would all be asked again the next day.
bulksquat_thrust: speaking of ban worthy peripherals, im soldering one together tomorrow CoolStoryBob
mitrocc: !mouse
mitrocc: outsmarted
nsielicki: is this still the modified version of the game? are you sure you removed all the mods to the rewards you made?
forkdb: They can always go back to being sub to watch, by doing that he would make more subs as well...
mik12f4: can you narrow the flags? maybe it will learn faster
mitrocc: If i cant type the k word i can write the m word
mitrocc: ezClap
gaocaandra: he changed it
TiPera: @mitrocc nip slip when? i saw the cat thingy lmao
gaocaandra: he's using default values for penalization
mitrocc: @TiPera She slipped the nip couple days ago, and took twitch 3 days to ban her
TheKoreanZombi: No lunar lander left behind.
bulksquat_thrust: Probably only because community outrage
logi6000: yo how you doij
TiPera: @mitrocc i just checked and her channel is still up, how dafuq ? D:
mitrocc: @TiPera Because twitch staff are virgins

mitrocc: Alinity
Pr0ject414: it doesnt appear to be learning at all
Santiago_LHC: Are people behaving? Do we need timeouts?
Pr0ject414: just random
justenpassant: the reward maybe?
Pr0ject414: its not consistent
mitrocc: @Santiago_LHC Ive bean a bad boy, i might need a timeout ;)
TheKoreanZombi: Run overnight. Will be very smart by tomorrow. So much thrust.
Santiago_LHC: It's not fun if you enjoy it
Pr0ject414: if your plotted those out it would be jumping all over the place and not a steady decline
mitrocc: I hate it :)
logi6000: oh yeah she's done all sorts of shit and gotten away. she just dosent get banned. probably fucks the twitch staff to get free

mr_stochastic: @NYCyril Config settings
bulksquat_thrust: @NYCyril usually vim configs and bash configs
TheKoreanZombi: I am an expert at identifying randomness after reading George's book recommendation: A Million Random Digits with 100,000 Normal Deviates.
l1ght5p33d: files that start with .
mangoxavier: When it runs what is an error? the strings that start with 2?
routerkicker: @iKanak_ it's just muzero he's gotten this to work with other deep learning algos
l1ght5p33d: must do ls -al
MABunglawala: jailbreak PS5? when it comes out
NYCyril: oh ok thanks @mr_stochastic @bulksquat_thrust
jwlolol: @logi6000 yeah that's why i was wondering which dotfiles hah

Pr0ject414: call yourself the conductor
TheKoreanZombi: @munchfumble Ah. Gotcha. He uses it because it is quick to prototype.
DeeboMC: did they contract
mangoxavier: it was plus and then minus interesting
bulksquat_thrust: @zetto97 cool! I kinda know spanish, trying to learn to read latin rn
nsielicki: does it need to experience more things or does it need to learn more from the experiences its had
wthbro: hello
aaaakshat: Oh crap we're live again
aaaakshat: can anyone update what's happening
DeeboMC: ... contract scorpion computer services for that? lol
logi6000: @aaaakshat people want to know what the dotfiles are
bulksquat_thrust: @aaaakshat hes using an ai lib to solve a lunar lander game
aaaakshat: ooooh that's epiuc
aaaakshat: thanks
l1ght5p33d: @logi6000 that's why they want them.. no one knows
KAZERKE: Hello George moon2S
Pr0ject414: @nsielicki i would contend that it needs to learn more from what is has already experienced
cafe807: geohot is in love I guess
wthbro: lighting temperature is terrible BibleThump
logi6000: @l1ght5p33d but if its tmux and vim or anything else in his config repo
zetto97: @bulksquat_thrust very good broo
mangoxavier: yall are joking right? go google how to terminal and don't waste time
logi6000: then he scammin
nsielicki: @Pr0ject414 see i'm leaning the other way, i think it's just not trying enough new stuff
nsielicki: is 414 a reference to MIL?
l1ght5p33d: @logi6000 what config repo
DeeboMC: @zetto97 how do you get spanish and russian as your natives? interesting language combo

Pr0ject414: MKE
cod4_lightning: why you are yellow?
nsielicki: word, I grew up in germantown
Pr0ject414: nice.
mangoxavier: How are you keeping track of what you're learning when you're changing the numbers?
zetto97: @deebomc family :O
mangoxavier: just versioning or all in your head?

Waldoqq: WTF
DeeboMC: 'rona lmao
Waldoqq: fakes news
logi6000: @waldoqq no he did
DeeboMC: he didnt go tho.
Waldoqq: George is the best law abiding citizen who never tries to insult big brother
logi6000: @deebomc oh he didnt
DeeboMC: he thought about it
l1ght5p33d: config is weak af
Waldoqq: idk who you ar etalking about @logi6000
mangoxavier: doing -150 to -400 with that last change but only a few positives, the one before had quite a few positives with lower - numbers
l1ght5p33d: my bash_rc is like 200 lines
forkdb: Is Kim dead?
l1ght5p33d: can i just dump it in chat or no

logi6000: anyone want what could possibly be the dotfiles
logi6000: https://github.com/geohot/configuration?files=1
nsielicki: we went from 50 to 10 with I and it started behaving better -- maybe we overshot. I'd try 20
DeeboMC: @zetto97 spanish via south america i presume?
mangoxavier: oohhhhh damn it's doing better after it gets a positive then fails
DeeboMC: as opposed to spain or mexico
DeeboMC: im guessing argentina
nsielicki: Does it need to learn more from what it's experienced or does it need to experience new things
mangoxavier: That's awesome
nsielicki: hell yeah
zetto97: @deebomc spanish via Spain
logi6000: remember sub only chat
mangoxavier: I think it only learns through exp? right?
eeXecute: Have a good night George
mangoxavier: hmmm
DeeboMC: ah i see. dinner at your folks house must be dank af lol
Pr0ject414: Nature vs. Nurture arguments
nizero: George how was the protest
Santiago_LHC: nature is nurturing
info303: i think lunar lander gets a big reward for landing safely rather than crashing, but it can't seem to stumble upon that scenario
l1ght5p33d: good config https://pastebin.com/Fd7bdmqL
mangoxavier: beginners luck
kniightt: hi george thumpF
logi6000: I use zsh
logi6000: with vim controls
DeeboMC: @l1ght5p33d noiice!
mangoxavier: It's like it rewards then is complacent and loses. But it looked like it was losing less after each success.
Pr0ject414: on the surface it doesnt appear to remember what it has learned
Kawhiet: Maybe the goal should be hover first?
nsielicki: i fucking hate zsh, i hate that catalina defaults to it. try `printf hello` in your terminal
l1ght5p33d: @DeeboMC like that ffr
l1ght5p33d: thats what you want
nsielicki: where did the output go? zsh removed it
logi6000: @nsielicki echo hello
nsielicki: right, it likes it if you give it a newline, but if it's not there it eats your output
DeeboMC: lol hell yea boi
logi6000: pretty sure george uses zsh
mangoxavier: yeah, left over how long though, and is there a way for it to improve faster and not be so random. that's the issue right?
monaliso: you should really be concerned about "printf", yep
mik12f4: there are so many more ways to fuck up i guess
Roundlay: naysay2SITREP
mangoxavier: push that to 3 lol
perfectdotexe: Geohot is my inspiration, he's the reason why I strive to be the person I can be. Knocking out what I need to do plus more.
Jehhred: If only the objective was to make the rocket fall as fast as possible
perfectdotexe: First time I caught him streaming.
Pr0ject414: The Unity ML agents has that feature i believe.
l1ght5p33d: why are there ssh in geohots config hes gonna hack me now isn't he
mangoxavier: Feels very close
nsielicki: @monaliso try python3 -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write(b'hello')" if you want a different example
DeeboMC: goin extra innings tonight. thinking of tapping out, eating tacos and finally starting DEVS
maddyakhil: !uptime
nsielicki: zsh eats malformed output which is ridiculous. It'd be one thing if they added an extra newline, it's another when they just stop showing you output of programs you run
DeeboMC: @l1ght5p33d wait what? you got his configs?
Pr0ject414: give it more trainings?
logi6000: @deebomc yeah https://github.com/geohot/configuration?files=1
logi6000: they been public
logi6000: loo
nsielicki: lol
logi6000: lol
neekolulbot: lol
mangoxavier: you also rose dim
info303: i remember alphazero filling up the buffer first before even beginning the training, not sure if this applies here
DOWRIGHT: 50*
perfectdotexe: $ twenty doll hairs
Santiago_LHC: @DeeboMC DEVS is good!
Pr0ject414: you would hope to see a nice curve
logi6000: I'll give the link to anybody for 25 dollar bitcoin.
perfectdotexe: @DOWRIGHT what up LUL dowrigPup
Pr0ject414: that unfortunately does not appear to be a curve
neekolulbot: what do you think about financial RL? For asset allocation among many assets?
DOWRIGHT: hi @perfectdotexe just fixing bugs. what up with you?
DeeboMC: batman@z840 ? @l1ght5p33d
logi6000: @dowright yo you Streaming tomorrow?
swagrrr: did we ever fold a protein?
CaptainRoberts: !uptime
perfectdotexe: @DOWRIGHT Wrapping up classes, just did a few tryhackme challenges.
DOWRIGHT: yes ^_^ @logi6000
logi6000: @dowright sick
mangoxavier: haha
ancientchineseelder: on adderall today george?
CaptainRoberts: how long has he been streaming, chat?
DeeboMC: @Santiago_LHC im looking forward to it
bubblesnot: What would Elon do?
nsielicki: 6 hours maybe?
wthbro: what the idea behind the program, want it to hover or land?
markydothh: Does George do adderall?
Santiago_LHC: You can do it, Mu!
logi6000: @ancientchineseelder that's a no no drugs prob gonna be a ban topic soon
PrivateOrange: Run a huge cluster and train train train
bulksquat_thrust: @DOWRIGHT sup!
DOWRIGHT: yooooooooooooo o/
perfectdotexe: Geohot is naturally on drugs, he doesn't need em
JdPaulBlart: we need a deeper net squadR
mangoxavier: It spent more time like you thought but then dicked around like before
bulksquat_thrust: @DOWRIGHT still working on the next-gen firewall?
DeeboMC: @l1ght5p33d it was in the ssh folder
Kawhiet: professional hyperparameter tuner
JdPaulBlart: new goal is to create an ai to tune ais
DOWRIGHT: yea @bulksquat_thrust just uploaded the new build to github today
logi6000: @jdpaulblart were gonna need an ai to tune that ai
bubblesnot: Can you train it to just hover consistently?
bulksquat_thrust: @DOWRIGHT sick!
JdPaulBlart: recursive ai tuning
ancientchineseelder: im new in here what is the project here?
mik12f4: maybe lunar lander is a boeing product?
info303: curious if it would quickly learn to land between the poles if you start it off in the corner
ancientchineseelder: i last tuned in during covid
logi6000: @jdpaulblart inefficient and never gets the job done
logi6000: what more do you want
perfectdotexe: I was doing a discussion in college about machine learning and decided to clip geohot from a youtube video, I almost posted him smoking weed LUL
isalhi: what’s the project tnght?

logi6000: so I got a good zshrc goin for 5 dollar eth
logi6000: do I here 10 dollar
mangoxavier: 80 and 63 were positive
DeeboMC: lol it was publicly available as @l1ght5p33d said.. now its worth money ? whats goin on here lol
cod4_lightning: @georgehotz bro that dedication you have is remarkable!
mangoxavier: yeah!

raystriker98: let it run the whole night
mangoxavier: what is the reward rule for not dying?
whoishenry123: wouldn't this be easier to test if you had a more powerful GPU?
logi6000: all money goes back to gifting subs too
DeeboMC: @logi6000 ur killin me bro lol
nsielicki: can you recap what changes were made to get you here?
logi6000: so you might get your money back
jay_al97: @georgehotz has anyone gotten this to work better than this
nsielicki: k=3? replay size? iterations
nsielicki: it definitely is better
bulksquat_thrust: is this a library you can run with a gpu?
Kawhiet: barrel roll 2.0
yuvi___: just joined stream. anyone wanna explain whats going on?
logi6000: @deebomc I try my best
DeeboMC: haha
Pr0ject414: show the graph?
mangoxavier: oooh
nsielicki: nice
mangoxavier: hmmm
blizz191: activision elu different then relu?
mik12f4: yeah better
logi6000: @yuvi___ you have to send me 10 dollar eth to continue watching. he will ban otherwise. I give good tmux conf with purchase
l1ght5p33d: we only like prime numbers
l1ght5p33d: 67 > 69
bubblesnot: Does it have weight? Can you dump fuel before landing?
logi6000: monitizing
logi6000: hey where my star
l1ght5p33d: not sex wise tho
mangoxavier: hell yes
logi6000: I'm still subbed I have 2x multiplier
DeeboMC: good .xmobarrc, only 6 years old
l1ght5p33d: unless 67 is a really good move ...
Pr0ject414: add more neurons
mangoxavier: oh man two in a row then hover a long time
mangoxavier: 99, 92, then hover
nsielicki: does he live in sf or la?
bulksquat_thrust: them losses be gettin smaller
mangoxavier: 175!

Kawhiet: this honestly feels like gambling
fenharelthedreadwolf: what should I do to get selected for working in comma.ai?
logi6000: mission beach San Diego
mangoxavier: It learns a lot after it hovers
cod4_lightning: is the code on github?
Super_car_car: oh snap im in PL
mangoxavier: look at the pattern before it hovers
bulksquat_thrust: what protest?
cod4_lightning: what car do you have?
logi6000: wheres my star anyone else see its gone
mangoxavier: 1 pos then hover, then 2 pos then hover, then 3 or more pos then hover
JdPaulBlart: for the record i suggested deeper net like 30 mins so wheres my mod
routerkicker: yeah it's gone
logi6000: I'm still subbed tho.
kisspapa: trying to finish my elf infector virus for cybersec, been stuck for a day, fuck ELFs lol
Apimar: What we making today xD
cod4_lightning: what car do you have?
Pr0ject414: do even deeper net
logi6000: its gone
DeeboMC: you got a z840 at work?
mangoxavier: far bigger positives with this
JdPaulBlart: hows this DEEPER NET MR STREAMER
lebop: george what do you think about doing another hackerrank type of stream?
nsielicki: 3 consecutive positive results, don't you dare reset this shit
nsielicki: 4
logi6000: dont know what happened. I'm still subbed. twitch was afraid of my genius marketing ploys
DeeboMC: suggest it better!
info303: it learned to hever
info303: hover
mangoxavier: yess
Pr0ject414: RESET.... RESET... RESET... to the beat of the drums
mangoxavier: yesss
mangoxavier: more it hovers more success you see and higher each time
Kawhiet: learns to hover and then the randomness kicks in
DeeboMC: @logi6000 its hard out here for a pimp
logi6000: @deebomc lol
bulksquat_thrust: im trying to understand the 2D m.losses list number
nsielicki: train more on replay
nsielicki: increase i
mangoxavier: why winder rather than deeper?
Pr0ject414: hear me out... a deeper wider net
brofessorbob: Balls Deep Net
hardtarget4: lol
anasshm123: when she tells you go deeper but the programmer didn't give you enough pp
logi6000: @georgehotz guess twitch was afraid of my genius marketing ploys
cod4_lightning: imagine americans starting immigration to the middle east because of coronavirus?
DeeboMC: lmaooo
l1ght5p33d: wtf did u just do
DeeboMC: pp
mangoxavier: bignet is a type of desert in the south
fenharelthedreadwolf: can we make it mandatory that some action must be always performed ?
Waldoqq: I LOVE CORONAVIRUS I LOVE CORONAVIRUS I LOVE CORONAVIRUS I LOVE CORONAVIRUS I LOVE CORONAVIRUS I LOVE CORONAVIRUS
mangoxavier: yikes
DeeboMC: never heard of it. i want to eat bignet
nsielicki: @fenharelthedreadwolf we shouldn't have to, that's the point of munet
perfectdotexe: Does a geohot, hoot?
logi6000: twitch should give me my big dick star back
nsielicki: muzero or whatever
wthbro: When did you start programming?
anasshm123: I'm out of the loop can someone fill me on what's going on, is this Comma A.I 2.0?
mangoxavier: hmmmm
almondsnakes: yo this guy has a dishwasher he must be loaded
logi6000: twitch is just afraid of me
mangoxavier: oh shit
Waldoqq: @anasshm123 no its covid-19 2.0
cod4_lightning: how much would you sell comm ai for?
aalhendi: You still have a sustainable supply of limes in your pantry?
DeeboMC: holy shit. i didnt pronounce it right. you meant bignets like as in cafe du monde.. yea ive eaten those lmao
anasshm123: @Waldoqq thanks for the info
brofessorbob: 100 Billion Dollars
mangoxavier: oooooh

Penguino138: When does it refuel its landers?
breadhamandegg: Pog
Pr0ject414: big net for big dicks
l1ght5p33d: things so good
mangoxavier: fuck the car up the hill this motherfucker is flying
brofessorbob: Balls Deep Net
jeronm: Pog
logi6000: so I'mma just start monitizing again
DeeboMC: that just blem my mind
KAZERKE: which one
DeeboMC: how did it know?
peter35_: bignet mogs me
Waldoqq: incels OMEGALUL
anasshm123: How to know you are an Incel?
almondsnakes: that's a chad move
rahfuls: please limit facial touching in order to fade lord rona
wthbro: you know what I did today? nothing :)
anasshm123: I watched a doc on E-boys
DOWRIGHT: if you in this chat. you an incel.
brofessorbob: Pacific Beach is full of Chads
bulksquat_thrust: most incels are just simps in disguise
DOWRIGHT: oh wait....
info303: since it randomly picks from game history buffer, it might explain the instability of the value function
fenharelthedreadwolf: can we auto adjust neural networks size dynamically?
logi6000: I have a amazing screenrc best screenrc never been a better one. make you a 10x better programmer. only 10 dollars eth
mangoxavier: set random to 1
mangoxavier: real good
DeeboMC: bruh thats funny if u think that; theres just diverse ppl out here breh
mangoxavier: this is great
sk84uhlivin: PogChamp
info303: woot!
brofessorbob: lol
IMTotes: LULW
Penguino138: Geo Musk
mangoxavier: give it less gas lol
Super_car_car: this is amazing
brofessorbob: Bro landed in a crater
NYCyril: @logi6000 do you make screen great again with your screenrc ?
Penguino138: @brofessorbob You want to land in craters typically
Pr0ject414: ok hear me out again... lets do an even bigger deeper net.
cod4_lightning: imagine americans starts immigrating to the middle east because of coronavirus
brofessorbob: @Penguino138 Thanks Bro
logi6000: @nycyril yes better than tmux. best rc. best thing to ever touch your computer 10 dollars eth or if you order in the next 10 hours it's only 9.99 eth
info303: MOAR neurons!
nsielicki: @cod4_lightning nah i'm good thanks tho
Penguino138: @brofessorbob I mean its not the goal of the game, but in real life it's usually safer in craters
mik12f4: does it have to learn to shut off thrusters too?
l1ght5p33d: I saw geohot copy like three layers of neurons then it started working
brofessorbob: Is mission beach open to the public?
l1ght5p33d: this stream is blssed af
logi6000: @brofessorbob yea
mangoxavier: does it get an equal reward for thrusters off + in the flags?
fenharelthedreadwolf: sir I am a newbie and wanted to know can we dynamically adjust neural network size as we learn ?
mangoxavier: oh
brofessorbob: Trying to get pitted
logi6000: oh I dont know about now tho
DeeboMC: if i wasnt dodgin warrants id be in the trap rn... prolly watchin this on a phone with earbuds.. instead of the laptop i traded drugs for @DOWRIGHT true story; non incel here
Kawhiet: does this mean we'll get starfox?
brofessorbob: We training on CPU or GPU here?
logi6000: twitch give me my mother fucking big dick star back
DOWRIGHT: @DeeboMC airpods?
routerbomber: !uptime
DeeboMC: nah im fiscally responsibler than that. i bank my monmey
mangoxavier: ex machina shit you just did to the lander right there
logi6000: @deebomc so anyways I started snitching
DeeboMC: @logi6000 lmaooo
logi6000: lol jk
Waldoqq: @logi6000 NEVER SUBBED NEVER DONATED
LordHord: Star?
bulksquat_thrust: bulksquat_thrust subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 2 months, currently on a 2 month streak! imagine not having a star
mangoxavier: ehhh
logi6000: @bulksquat_thrust twitch took my star
DOWRIGHT: isnt casting data to int > range > list > np also a huge bottleneck?
bulksquat_thrust: @logi6000 those bastards!
logi6000: I still have my 2x multiplier
Neoriginal: the biggest bottleneck is patience
logi6000: but now it just says I'm not subbed
JdPaulBlart: is this how you tuned autopilot
brofessorbob: @logi6000 contact twitch bro
JdPaulBlart: openpiliot
logi6000: @brofessorbob how
l1ght5p33d: @DOWRIGHT where does that happen
DOWRIGHT: i would assign np. random. choice to a local var np_random_choice and see if i can pull out some of those data converions.
mik12f4: what causes it to take more time on each game?
brofessorbob: @logi6000 IDK google it. Maybe twitter?
logi6000: should I just email them give me my mother fucking big dick star back on geohot channel
l1ght5p33d: lookup table? pickle?
gigafact: @logi6000 click on your username on chat. your sub just expired it looks like
nsielicki: fuck buzz aldrin
bulksquat_thrust: damn
bulksquat_thrust: lol
logi6000: j got it like two days ago
mangoxavier: everyone sub
chetdonovan: koilD
pwnbase: did you see the vid where buzz punched that guy
KAZERKE: would the AI knows about the 5G towers and corona ? 🤔
DOWRIGHT: @l1ght5p33d it might not be part of the code executing tbh. but the look with counter is doing similar, just not as extreme
l1ght5p33d: lookup table of every possible frame the game can be in to speed type conversion
DOWRIGHT: loop*
gaocaandra: what did i miss
gaocaandra: did it work?
DeeboMC: It did
gaocaandra: nice
mangoxavier: I don't see a pattern but hope the graph is good
DOWRIGHT: having to loop up a method ever iter is gunna add overhead.
gaocaandra: what was the problem
l1ght5p33d: rewrite game in assembly
DOWRIGHT: look
brofessorbob: Any module or tool to help benchmark python code to identify potential bottlenecks?
DeeboMC: What da prolem is
nsielicki: so... is that album art actually just captain crunch having sex with a crossdressing koolaid man?
DeeboMC: 😂
mhmd0: !live
DeeboMC: Made me cough up Newport smoke
nsielicki: hahah guess we're even
bulksquat_thrust: im just trying to figure out what the picture on the wall is a reference of
mik12f4: this one not as good
mangoxavier: one eye dude got cucked
fenharelthedreadwolf: does adding negative rewards any useful ?
DeeboMC: 😂 there we go @nsielicki
wthbro: what ⌨️ are you using?
mangoxavier: there are some hovers prett close
bulksquat_thrust: @wthbro you've done it now
wthbro: Kappa
mangoxavier: but not great positives
fenharelthedreadwolf: for example if it doesn't do anything for a certain time , you start reducing the rewards
DeeboMC: Emoji’s gettin slick @wthbro
Kawhiet: participation trophy
mangoxavier: graph doesn't look good
bulksquat_thrust: this ai is a summary of my self education in CS
bulksquat_thrust: "wants to learn but gives up"
logi6000: still letting me sub like it didnt yesterday.
bulksquat_thrust: haha
logi6000: just keeps saying something went wrong and shows me an ugly ass animated girl
LordHord: @logi6000 your card got declined homie
logi6000: no when I go into the menu to sub
DeeboMC: so what’s this deal with this ghidra shit @l1ght5p33d
치킨워커: are you hiring
l1ght5p33d: @DeeboMC assembly lookup table
l1ght5p33d: with tooltips
DeeboMC: The nsa just released it to the public tho?
scullionw: scullionw subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
l1ght5p33d: @DeeboMC version 1 theyre probably on like at least 100 by now
mik12f4: does the first number represent how long its in the air?
DeeboMC: Ahh I see.. just taunting us n shit I guess.
JdPaulBlart: good night @georgehotz youre welcome for suggesting deeper net btw
luggy_b0i: @logi6000 If you're in the US make sure you pay with paypal. Xsolla might be triggering something with whoever your service provider is.
Faceless_Bard: good morning everyone o/
mangoxavier: watching this helps u figure it out
purpaleslushiii: @georgehotz what is the most important math to be a good coder?
mangoxavier: that graph is looking rather good
itsChopsticks: anyone else functionally retarded and doesnt understand it
itsChopsticks: just me? sick
nsielicki: this stuff is just very difficult, don't say that about yourself
luggy_b0i: @logi6000 And you might have to call them now if they blocked your card. I wont lie, it happened to me once.
DeeboMC: Nah bro, just need more prerequisites in place
mangoxavier: yes ever changing landscape and needing to learn.
calcmath: been gone a while, what is he doing now?
itsChopsticks: i'll just stick to writing really bad scripts in ps and python, compsci people just too big brain for me
brofessorbob: Is perl a dead language?
mik12f4: first numbers are all small
nsielicki: learn perl if you want to make money
nsielicki: dead languages pay more
Creamy_Goodness_: A strange game. The only winning move is not to play.
brofessorbob: I heard Cobal can make you loot
itsChopsticks: if you feel like supporting dead systems, sure
stone43_: Perl is easy to learn though if you know Ruby or Python
itsChopsticks: COBOL sucks ass
mangoxavier: yeah
mangoxavier: looks random
mangoxavier: your random is set to .02 not .05
FangSkillz: he doesn't read chat LUL
brofessorbob: Python popped my cherry and trying to figure a next language.
mangoxavier: yeah
DOWRIGHT: big disk club!
brofessorbob: 0.5
DeeboMC: Depends on if you want a really specific job at place that’s probably irrelevance; otherwise yeah don’t waste your time
nsielicki: your mcts was slow but you should work that back in real quick and see if it makes a difference
mik12f4: looks way worse?
Super_car_car: your discount is .98 instead of .998?
Super_car_car: ah my bad
tangobeer: !uptime
l1ght5p33d: discount is bad terminology
l1ght5p33d: going into the future does not mean good or bad, it should be a "reducing" or "avoiding" type of language
mik12f4: seems like it only learns when it takes its time
calcmath: whichhe playing iwht now? envirnment is
calcmath: still cartpole?
brofessorbob: Aite Bros. This Bro needs to sleep. Good luck with landing the lunar lander Geo-bro.
Waldoqq: anyone want to watch me stream Svelte?
calcmath: oops got mangled
Kawhiet: It's not learning to hover tho
DeeboMC: I wonder what carrot top’s up to right now. Prolly re-reading Knuth, working on the replacement for python
mangoxavier: nah
nsielicki: I had never heard of value prediction network, thought it might be related to value prediction in computer architecture but I guess it's not
nsielicki: I did a (failed) research project on microarchitecture VP
mangoxavier: yeah, before big net
Waldoqq: BibleThump
l1ght5p33d: typescript > python
Pr0ject414: whoever suggested the even bigger deep net is an asshole
Waldoqq: Typescript > English
Pr0ject414: lupoCREEP lupoCREEP
Faceless_Bard: a serious/not serious question chat : do you think tools like muzero will make speedrunning much harder , if the game devs build around it ?
calcmath: wider nets are more stable than deeper nets
routerkicker: branch prediction in modern cpu architectures is done by neural nets as well @nsielicki
mangoxavier: tighten net, confirm, raise random, confirm, adjust
mik12f4: what can you change to get first number above 500?
pogu: @routerkicker that's pretty insane. Is NN inference THAT cheap now
routerkicker: yeah it's right on the chip though
nsielicki: @routerkicker value prediction is not the same as branch prediction
l1ght5p33d: @Faceless_Bard Isn't speed running already hard why would it matter if the difficulty is changed
mangoxavier: self.epsilon = self.epsilon * self.decay
Faceless_Bard: l1ght5p33d probably making the games unbuggable ? one way
nsielicki: @routerkicker see https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15740-f03/www/lectures/ValuePredictionDisc.htm
routerkicker: thanks
bulksquat_thrust: 5 hundred thousand
mangoxavier: Ɛ = Ɛ * decay :⇔ Ɛ = Ɛ * decay ^ X
mangoxavier: self.epsilon = self.epsilon * self.decay
nsielicki: @routerkicker if you're interested in trying the problem yourself, https://www.microarch.org/cvp1/
mangoxavier: got to go to bed, later
nsielicki: ut-austin just beat André Seznec by quite a bit which is a big deal
DeeboMC: @faceless_bard I was just about to say sorry no one address that because I thought it was interesting but I didn’t even know how to articulate why I felt like it wouldn’t have an effect but I guess that’s a theory, although “unbuggable” seems a little more optimistic than I’d be willing to bank on
tripcloth: whatch making geoh
Faceless_Bard: DeeboMC SeemsGood i think i could have asked that better . But yeah perhaps very optimistic , but maybe 'bugfree' enough so that its impossible to speedrun. It might be a tool publishers like , since put time limits that are always never enough for a game to be polished properly :thinking:
Faceless_Bard: since they*
DeeboMC: I could see that but *jeff goldblum voice* “life.. uh uh uh.. finds a way” 😆
Faceless_Bard: :P
gigafact: it's this what they do at TeslaAI
DeeboMC: with much less shit talking im sure
nsielicki: discount definitely was involved when we were winning that
stone43_: This is what ML engineers do all day
Faceless_Bard: with probably better hardware :o
Pr0ject414: we had 3 nets
nsielicki: i think it was really low like 96
Pr0ject414: when it was working
Pr0ject414: it wasnt wider than original
info303: tesla self driving neural net architechture is pretty nutty
DeeboMC: you have an article?
stone43_: ixnay on the eslaTay talk
Nicholai518: Hey @georgehotz showing you some LOVE from NY
DeeboMC: ok but i wanna know about thier neural net architechture and why its so nutty
DeeboMC: alktay*
Pr0ject414: we were at like 200k for the model
Fr0zenOfficial: good morning :)
Pr0ject414: what is it at now?
SparksCx: !uptime
Pr0ject414: when it worked*
raystriker98: congrats your model is a teenager
DeeboMC: "my cpu is a neural net processor, a learning compyootuh... ahhhehh"
nsielicki: models
mik12f4: better numbers an hour ago
SparksCx: lol
gigafact: haha
nsielicki: lmfao when it came in sideways
Faceless_Bard: LUL
Keboburrito: lol
t0rment1337: lmaoo
Faceless_Bard: need a compilation of those clips
Santiago_LHC: Did we land yet?
DeeboMC: its gettin funky
SparksCx: atleast is firing all it's rockets
DeeboMC: a few good ones
gigafact: this is amazing
routerkicker: once we touched the ground at 0 speed and then took off again
suav12: What are the plots?
DeeboMC: thats what i beeen thinkin... this mfker is forgetful
nsielicki: time on x axis, rewards is top graph, bottom graph is losses
bulksquat_thrust: ive decided im going to make an aimbot for bannerlord as my programming project
stone43_: I joined late. No MCTS?
Fr0zenOfficial: I just joined what we doin here? :D
Pr0ject414: didnt they have like 500000
nsielicki: MCTS was slow and didn't make a difference
electro_y0: !uptime
Pr0ject414: in the replay buffer
routerkicker: YES weigh samples by reward sounds good
l1ttlemtman: good morning
DeeboMC: yea because it needs some specificity
toxyviper: He make a game?
l1ttlemtman: a reinforcement learning environment
nsielicki: no he teach a computer to win game
DeeboMC: the game is just there to test his heuristic
info303: wonder if they will use this type of solution for real lunar landers one day :D
bulksquat_thrust: @info303 oh god i hope not
NoLimitFitness: !uptime
webuser011: george, are you a robot?
stone43_: at least not this model
info303: @bulksquat_thrust haha well, I mean if you fast forward into the future
routerkicker: nah they got lasers and analytical algorithms that work better. ML is used for realtime obstacle avoidance on landing though.
bulksquat_thrust: @info303 going to be some enders game shit where bots are learning on real landers hahaha
nsielicki: is that actually how the spacex landing works? lidar?
info303: well the output from the lazers would be the input into RL algorithm, and the analytical algorithms replaced with a neural net
nsielicki: I would think that the exhaust of the rocket would make that impossible
DeeboMC: are we at like 5 hours now?
opheimer: !uptime
nsielicki: it's way past 5 hours, closer to 7 or 8
routerkicker: idk about spacex maybe we can get george to break nda LUL

JoeMountMount: what happened to solving COVID Kappa
SciTwi: Hi George! How are you doing with all the stuff that's going on?
l1ttlemtman: do you speak chinese ?
mik12f4: what does the number before the reward represent?
entangledbeing: How much u make on twitch lol
nsielicki: you ever work with FPGAs? You think this sort of turnaround on validation is long, try waiting 12 hours for synthesis
IaMvAzU: r u planning on becoming a twitch partner?
bulksquat_thrust: ive got the beefiest pc you can build and visual studio still runs like a snail hobbHands
nsielicki: @mik12f4 number of steps before game dies
info303: @mik12f4 timesteps
JakeLes: Visual studio runs well wat
mik12f4: thanks
l1ttlemtman: make a carla reinforcement agent

l1ght5p33d: an*
l1ght5p33d: a
DeeboMC: Cookin*
JoeMountMount: @l1ght5p33d why would you need a mass spec lol
TasosTheLord: HeyGuys
l1ght5p33d: an ai mass spectrometer
JoeMountMount: yeah why
l1ttlemtman: muzero on go thinks 12 steps ahead
nsielicki: i believe this problem will be solved tonight
tytos01: can you do some GridSearchCV on this ?
l1ght5p33d: @JoeMountMount because its too expensive for you
DeeboMC: https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=MRj5KT3742o&feature=share
JoeMountMount: like why would ai help mass spectometry
l1ttlemtman: yes that was for the paper version
l1ttlemtman: they ran another version for 2 weeks or so
l1ght5p33d: @JoeMountMount now you're asking the right questions
JakeLes: So this is the guy they base all the hackers on in movies
mik12f4: wouldnt there have to be a minimum number of timesteps in order for it not to crash?
JoeMountMount: @l1ght5p33d LUL but what was he planning to do w it?
l1ght5p33d: also sammy kamkar
l1ght5p33d: samy
PFY1: hey guys, how do i get started with python and ML?
stone43_: read
JoeMountMount: take a class
JoeMountMount: or watch some free lectures
info303: tons of cheap online courses
l1ttlemtman: make a carla agent
knitler_: chess wouldnt the reward value matter less?
l1ttlemtman: that would be cool with muzero
l1ght5p33d: @PFY1 read all this at least 3 times https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/
l1ght5p33d: then look for code to copy and paste
smurfd0: now it had those "feelers" for a bit (i guess they are thrusters)
l1ttlemtman: wow thats good advice lol
PFY1: @l1ght5p33d thanks lol
stone43_: That's a good site

l1ttlemtman: please play the atari game
Penguino138: @georgehotz how often are you a late night coder?
l1ttlemtman: its easier to see how it performs there
nsielicki: are you using the actual gym version of the game still? this isn't just like a fucked up reward function right?
DeeboMC: minusthebear
routerkicker: yeah it's the original
Jeptah88: Are we seeing a sample game or is it really learning 1 game at a time?
l1ght5p33d: it was better before
Jeptah88: LUL
Penguino138: Is there a certain time of day you prefer programming or does it just depend?
DeeboMC: reminds me of myexitunfair
nitrixen: @Penguino138 Ideally while I'm awake.
Penguino138: I mean it for geo :p

okeeeeeee: me
DeeboMC: muzero seems worth it... let it learn regardless tho
raystriker98: maybe we'll clip the video of a successful landing for you
guinness84: it solves both CartPole and CartPole PogChamp
routerkicker: are there other algos wich give you a dynamics model?
DeeboMC: they way it does it tho seeems more intelligent when it does get it right. it just doesnt seem to learn from its past very effieciently
l1ttlemtman: how many searches does it do on muzero compared to ppo ?
Jeptah88: The landing spot is in the same place, it should be really easy
Penguino138: beautiful
DeeboMC: it was just chillin
erlsek: noobzero
DeeboMC: burnn

l1ttlemtman: but still that way muzero has a lot more potential
KAZERKE: Wowee
sakshambhutani2001: nice
JjohnConstantine: what's the end goal?
birkett0011: Are there more complex simulations to test on? How many variable can these realistically handle?
nsielicki: any explanation for why the losses do that on the tail?
l1ttlemtman: go is 10^170 position
l1ttlemtman: s
l1ttlemtman: @birkett0011
