 I'm just going to create the table and its structure.  To do that, I'll remove the TODO comment, and I'll use the database argument that's being passed in.  It's named db, and I'll call a method called execute SQL or execSQL for short, and I'll pass in my constant that contains the SQL command that will create the table, that'll be TABLE_CREATE. 
The version number is the int argument passed to the [constructor (hyper-link)]. 
In the database file, the version number is stored in [PRAGMA user_version (hyper-link)]. 
If onCreate() returns successfully (doesn't throw an exception), the database is assumed to be created with the requested version number.
