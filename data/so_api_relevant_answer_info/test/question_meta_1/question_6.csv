,what does [BatchNorm1d (hyper-link)] do mathematically?,"Expected more than 1 value per channel when training, got input size torch.Size([1, **])",<pytorch><batch-normalization>,www.stackoverflow.com/questions/65882526,"I met an error when I use BatchNorm1d, code:
[code snippet]
but I met:Expected more than 1 value per channel when training, got input size torch.Size([1, 60])
the error message is:
[code snippet]
I have checked and I found that in out = self.BN1(out),out.shape = (1,60),it seems that batchsize=1 is not permitted in BatchNorm1d .But I don't know how to modify it.

,"It is simple: BatchNorm has two ""modes of operation"": one is for training where it estimates the current batch's mean and variance (this is why you must have batch_size>1 for training).","Expected more than 1 value per channel when training, got input size torch.Size([1, **])",<pytorch><batch-normalization>,www.stackoverflow.com/questions/65882526,"I met an error when I use BatchNorm1d, code:

,"The other ""mode"" is for evaluation: it uses accumulated mean and variance to normalize new inputs without re-estimating the mean and variance.","Expected more than 1 value per channel when training, got input size torch.Size([1, **])",<pytorch><batch-normalization>,www.stackoverflow.com/questions/65882526,"I met an error when I use BatchNorm1d, code:
