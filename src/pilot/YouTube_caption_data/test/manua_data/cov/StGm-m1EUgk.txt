Usisuvach0: i am stopping to smoke
yaus_baus: machine learning powered molecular synthesizer for psychoactive drogs
harbad: @georgehotz the best way is to stop the virus by inhibiting its glycoprotein spikes from attaching to the receptors that start host cell endocytosis.
lordBzzl: @Betazz could be an issue...
Usisuvach0: i got some weed on aside
THX1342: smashing that stripped ELF
Usisuvach0: hidden good
bebytesback: This is serious some of the best content on twitch, Thanks @georgehotz
habituss: Hey, I just got here, can someone explain what is the program he is reverse engineering?
mandjevant: Yo what's he doing?

theonlymonkas: BAN
harbad: covid-19 is what he's reverse engineering.
VanishBlox: BAN BAN
Lizardan: @habituss coronavirus

Penguino138: @Usisuvach0 I started my break on 3/15, got plenty of alochol
noobaj: @klairm_ the test's were wrong
ackxhpaez: Self-driving virus?
habituss: How the fuck is corona a program lol ?
yaus_baus: were hackin rona
Penguino138: Rona season bb
lordBzzl: viral envelopes need to go on strike
THX1342: everything is code in the simulation, habituss
harbad: nucleocapsid is just the body of the virus. it's just inside the lipid bilayer.
Usisuvach0: @habituss we are all programs
VanishBlox: @mandjevant he's geohots, he jailbroke the iPhone so he can jailbreak the virus too
Usisuvach0: our brain is the same as computer 0;s and 1;s
gyne: genetic...code
againstZzZ: habituss dna is basically algorithm
pogu: @habituss It's a thing that is programmed to do things in response to things, literally program

THX1342: wait til the IOT folk get a wiff of Biotech....
habituss: Alright, but where does the code comes from ?
b2kemann: wallstreet hits the floor
Apocalyptic0ne: rna sequence
lordBzzl: quarks are the primitive data type
harbad: it is the part of the virus that holds the genome and (in the case of covid-19) it is very weak. which is why it doesn't survive outside of a host for very long.
VanishBlox: dna is kinda like binary
socialnotsocial: @georgehotz thoughts on university?
bichid69: engineering boiiiiiiiiii
harbad: dna is only slightly more sophisticated than binary
THX1342: socialnotsocial his thoughts: it's a scam
robg_10: Does QIRA work with this ?
SHAVEYY_: genes are like binary
SHAVEYY_: they can be on or off
PiroFloydian: dna is basically in base 4
dvdutch: school is definitely a scam
VanishBlox: is dna like bytecode?
harbad: it's more like base 8 because of dna and rna
chusiv: He took the genome, translated it into RNA and then by isolating bytes he gets to split it into the different components of the virus.
Betazz: is there no such thing as a good virus?
Betazz: like bacteria
dvdutch: Is quaternary actually used for anything?
harbad: and codons then make it even more complex
lordBzzl: universe is weird, simple things become complex things
St47ik: @Betazz viruses aren't good or bad
recursive_x: I'm confused
VanishBlox: they just wanna fuck mate
St47ik: they're just genetic data moving around
theonlymonkas: NotLikeThis
THX1342: Betazz I think all viruses kill the host cells in their replication so I would say: no
Kustex: what is he trying to do?
foti_kasparov: university is the place people that seek for social value go
Betazz: hmm
murkythunder: why dont we create aids for sars
THX1342: unless you get a virus that eats only cancer cells
THX1342: that would be nice

theonlymonkas: @foti_kasparov PogChamp
VanishBlox: and your body is their perfect sex chamber 😏
lebop: what is he doing
Penguino138: University is a place for either doctors, or people who don't know what they want to do with their life so they waste it
lebop: ?
Betazz: viruses even take over bacteria then
harbad: there is such thing as a good virus, look up bacteriphages
lordBzzl: we need to bring the fight to virus nursery..
jadams: 5Head
harbad: they can be used for amazing things
THX1342: oh yeah bacteriophages... true
lordBzzl: or the virus womb

SHAVEYY_: bro they turned the computer virus into a real thing
lordBzzl: @Masturbear will do, thanks
SHAVEYY_: cant wait for fortnite irl
11plus4thinking: what are you trying to accomplish by reverse engineering the coronavirus
dtsa349: Hi George, nice to see you :) Happy to see you are working on some corona virus-related project. That quarantine already affected my life, the third week at home, working remotely, everything is closed except shop and pharmacy. I read a little bit about coronaVirus. The aspect you may have to consider is getting a virus inside the cell (mitosis) and protein ACE2. Scientists are trying to make a vaccine that stimulates to make antibodies for that protein. Have a nice day :)
TheHareld: @St47ik We are losing hard though :/
d3adb33: a deeper understanding is a good start for a reverse engeneering. Maybe more or less
Masturbear: Snowlav basically, but since theres ATCG which are all composed off many molecules alot can happen. but if you're just looking at results yea it's just like htat
is_physics: does he have access to paid papers?

couso_99: @Toastie1 I dont have a clue either :/
KruptWorld: im so happy this chat is actually chattable
abedbawsxx: @Riqour don't feed the trolls FailFish
yevheniiushtyk: does he have some prior skills in bio engineering? how does he do this shit wtf
11plus4thinking: @cybergenik why am i a reckful fan?
dj_vicio: slash to terminate maybe
bob_babyelephant: yo i love your shit
kubaaa6: kubaaa6 subscribed with Twitch Prime.

TrippinFlare: @yevheniiushtyk he's a bioinformatics dropout
JustAsGoodJo: LUL
KruptWorld: @yevheniiushtyk right!?!?! im tryn to get it too
11plus4thinking: @cybergenik ok so? doesnt mean im a fan
almonte550: Because they do bad stuff
lgtst_: extra crap
lgtst_: topping
ahahahaitslit: what the hell is he tryna do
JustAsGoodJo: you should put those protiens into pymol and see protein-protein interactions
dontusethiscode: doesn't look like a bad protein to me xD
samu79rai: ect.....
bob_babyelephant: also you use tmux and vim right
cybergenik: @11plus4thinking do you just like the meme?
Loutlot: @kubaaa6 I do python but mostly for fun
FoxMcWeezer: Ramirez! Cure me that Covid-19 now!
11plus4thinking: @Loutlot what does "fun" include LUL
miths: Im a java developer, help me chat PepeHands
bsuis: @kubaaa6 they're on yt
pistolpetepcp: i can solve coronus, give me btc
logi6000: just ran download sequesnces
toasty_jk2: because it is FASTA: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format
KruptWorld: i dunno @ahahahaitslit i think its finding the protein that can kill the corona
yevheniiushtyk: using arrow keys on hhkb is so fucking annoying
logi6000: can confirm it works on arch
samu79rai: faster george faster
kubaaa6: @Loutlot ok was wondering why staff was watching unless they knew programming :p
TrippinFlare: protein.is_bad()
tehEGO: Did corona possibly come from a snake, and now using python to solve it.. is that like two snakes eating each other
Tymski_: Every time I code in python I get missing :
miths: @yevheniiushtyk you get used to it really fast imo
JustAsGoodJo: maybe codons don't align with the total number of bp?
KruptWorld: @georgehotz do you ever listen to music when you code?

zak_krack: A 4K monitor really helps watching this stream
zargy: Have ice cream for dinner
yevheniiushtyk: @miths nice mac/win?
ancientwoodland: he's uploading corona into the mainframe
Lana_Lux: sounds like my dinners
KruptWorld: @hellashotsx he just made a library for helping find the protien that kills corona?? ahha i have no clue
icanthitthose: what does engineering the coronavirus mean?
parktype: What kind of fuckery is this?
limpid_kzonix: @juankinator lol
AresRai: hes making the corona sequence and then will see how it goes from there, protein folding will be difficult x)
BesterGester: @Lana_Lux He is creating a tool to check the differences between viruses
zak_krack: Also remember to go full screen with F11 and fold down your left side bar
Punkfx: What is his strategy here for reverse engineering Covid. That doesn’t even make sense
samthedogg: im back, have i missed much?
Lana_Lux: @BesterGester ah, cool. thanks
JustAsGoodJo: @Lana_Lux i'm working on understanding LUL. from what i gather, he's looking at fasta codes (which are sequences of dna) across multiple coronavirus strains potentially to compare them. he then translated those sequences into proteins to compare them
Tomishima: What is his strategy here for reverse engineering Covid. That doesn’t even make sense
samu79rai: George do you believe in aliens
miths: @yevheniiushtyk mbp 2015, planning on buying the new 14'' mbp though. hbu?
almonte550: @Punkfx we are just learning stuff

Nussinov: Tomishima it;s clickbait dumbass
DecayingSkullz: We need a Geohot cooking stream
fukurowlz: hacking the rice
pjayys77: hack the planet, cmon now
yevheniiushtyk: @georgehotz 2018 13" mpb, how long have you got the hhkb for?
icanthitthose: how do you get the corona sequence from a computer a program
OnlyB1ade: PokGardevoir
knrbg: Hello
OLEM13: An intereactive view of the virus?
Tomishima: He is out of his safe zone boys
JustAsGoodJo: @Lana_Lux but mrna sequences are pretty messy with regions that are untranslated or not coded into protein (ie functional bits) so he's cleaning them up
knrbg: How are you
phrixus_bro: hi
brownyyyylocks: whats in the oven?
yevheniiushtyk: @georgehotz which one do you have?
VGBurnzy: new macbook air, that's all
OnlyB1ade: hack the rice
TrippinFlare: new macbook air launched
dj_vicio: get a Lenovo Thinkpad
ideology_sniffing_raccoon: "CHEAP" LUL
dj_vicio: great for research
VGBurnzy: 1.1ghz.... what year is it?
1shortking: i3 for $1000 PepeLaugh

Mariosavitch: unless your poor.. $1000
djcows: Just get a pro
anon_v28: $1000 dual core lol
yevheniiushtyk: gotta use the repair program to fix the sticky keys, drives me mad
BesterGester: @VGBurnzy That's base clock, not boost
djcows: i got the 16, super solid
miths: thinkpad x230 for the poor
logi6000: 1300k for a laptop=poor?
limpid_kzonix: probably somebody will be interested in thisLook what I shared: COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) | Kaggle @MIUI| https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks
VGBurnzy: """pro"""
pistolpetepcp: Gotta pay the apple tax
Sky_Light_37: pls donate guys, he is poor
Juankinator: who needs ram anyway just close chrome tabs
Winnepooh_: extra 8gb of ram from Apple, $400
Lana_Lux: @JustAsGoodJo interesting. and thanks. once they're cleaned up or compared, what can you do wit that info
Program: Good evening, everyone.
SpecialAgentSkye: @VGBurnzy Missing 8 quotation marks buddy
Tomishima: @Sky_Light_37 lol
bob_babyelephant: lag
dj_vicio: cant do shit with 8GB of RAM. only open 2 tabs in chrome.
yevheniiushtyk: i got 8gb mpb pro and i kinda regret it lmao
VGBurnzy: @SpecialAgentSkye sorry
DBJNR876: yes i concur
almonte550: Are we going to predict what sars-3 gonna look like?
dabdabay: ne vaxta stream bashlayib bu oglan
bichid69: What happenned to your razer blade?
Nussinov: You're thinking of polypeptide
Tomishima: he just streams for fun and the FBI and CIA
JustAsGoodJo: polyprotein is functional protein that is chopped into bits by an enzyme
Nussinov: proteins are made of peptides
alexandru_cristiean: @georgehotz getting that sweet Google job or hacking my way to freedom?
AresRai: shape probably
dontusethiscode: Is this guy like a budget christopher olah? I
VGBurnzy: @alexandru_cristiean who would want to work for good LUL
imsuperficial: let's just discover where the coronavirus lives in latent space
Juankinator: cant we just nuke the coronavirus?
PiroFloydian: Keep reading you were almost there
QuantumDota: Memes
Hello_im_nix: !uptime
zak_krack: Proteins are 3d
yevheniiushtyk: work on temple os after hacking corona?
bichid69: What happened to your razer blade?
kevin21071: you ever took BCAA?
Nussinov: @georgehotz typically a protein a more biologically 'complete' unit, whereas peptide typically refers to much shorter, sometimes truncated proteins
Loutlot: Peptones are material prolines made of
Hello_im_nix: is that a HHKB? Sounds like one
dj_vicio: BCAA == chaim aminoacids
AresRai: @dontusethiscode budget ? :o google this guy
dj_vicio: chain*
kevin21071: Branch chain amino acids
Tomishima: pyhton > ruby
JustAsGoodJo: @Lana_Lux that's what i'm interested in seeing! you can look at protein interactions. once a virus is inserted into the cell membrane, it must replicate and make more of itself (more protein) so the goal is to disrupt that machinery
SpecialAgentSkye: We are developing an anti virus that we deploy with OTA update to all humans that can detect corona PogChamp Kappa
dontusethiscode: @AresRai google olah lol
fukurowlz: recently the minister of health of my country says "maybe this virus turn into a good person, in that case it will be another case" to avoid implement a quarantine
yevheniiushtyk: @Hello_im_nix yeah he's know to use hhkb
DecayingSkullz: @Hello_im_nix yes it is
JdPaulBlart: did you see the stanford paper on your speed detection challenge @georgehotz
ancientwoodland: critical firmware update, recommend immediate install
zak_krack: you can also download the 3d folded shape of coronavirus instead of just the protein sequence
peacedivision: we need to clone @georgehotz a few thousands like him maybe 1 would hack the ps4
Loutlot: Polypeptides are not act like Proteins unless they are folded correctly and functional
vaskogomez87: ah yes
Mariosavitch: jkerhgiu3wijefhwdf
logi6000: @peacedivision but that clone will get sued
dj_vicio: this guys' a robot
peacedivision: @logi6000 he wouldn't you can do it anonyomous
yevheniiushtyk: @dj_vicio just a big nerd
1ntegral_: yeah probably faster with dictionnaries
logi6000: should robots have rights?
pz3300: What happened with that case? Did it get dropped?
theonlymonkas: yes
JustAsGoodJo: i think you want to see the three dimensional structure of these proteins, which is a structural biology battle.
Nussinov: Loutlot this is not true. There are non-functional 'proteins' and functional 'peptides', this distinction is more or less meaningless, like most categorizations in biology
SpecialAgentSkye: Should rights have robots?
nitcat: nitcat subscribed at Tier 1.
bichid69: What happened to your razer blade?
parktype: What is this?
logi6000: @specialagentskye shiit idk
theonlymonkas: LUL

bufferovrflw: @11plus4thinking bro, you just assigned true to Coronavirus
TheRedLineUK: can I hear topre switches??
Nussinov: zak_krack that ramachandran outlier score Kreygasm
kaiokenx90: hey george i just farted wanna reverse engineer that?

peacedivision: @megaman0711 he's hacking the coronavirus, this would lead to a ps4 exploit
Mariosavitch: i got 99 sequences but a cure isnt one
megaman0711: ahaha
fukurowlz: @mashafique let him study two days and that will be enough
11plus4thinking: @bufferovrflw bro it was obviously a joke
Amaz1ngLALALA: Hi guys, I'm Russian from the future, you should stop him immediately, no joke
TheLogg: LOL^^^
bufferovrflw: @11plus4thinking bro...
SpecialAgentSkye: Hi russian from the future. Im adopted
pz3300: In soviet russia virus cures you!
bichid69: use tensorflow to find a cure bro
11plus4thinking: @bufferovrflw bro meet me @ twitchcon
yevheniiushtyk: oi guys, you got any tips on how to get into reverse engineering, and binary stuff, i wanna broaden my skillz a lil
peacedivision: he is making the ultimate virus that would wipe the world in seconds and he will be immunite to it
mashafique: @fukurowlz enough for what?
TrippinFlare: what's cleaving?
bufferovrflw: @11plus4thinking bro we're gonna have a good time at twitchcon bro
TrippinFlare: cleaving - Proteolysis is the breakdown of proteins into smaller polypeptides or amino acids.
bichid69: @yevheniiushtyk it's jus 1 0 bro
yevheniiushtyk: history 🤔
SpecialAgentSkye: Just make an AI that guesses them PogChamp
Tomishima: is do not trust this dna sequence
yevheniiushtyk: @bichid69 wot
Mariosavitch: what do you wnat
TrippinFlare: google
11plus4thinking: @bufferovrflw bro im gonna bash ur head in bro squadR
bufferovrflw: @11plus4thinking bro, don't
Tomishima: remember the Xerox copy machine software bug
Nussinov: Try researching the protease from a previous coronavirus. the chemical mechanism of the cleavage should be well understood at this point
logi6000: it started with new something
zak_krack: cleaving is chopping a protein sequence into pieces
logi6000: I have 1k channel points
SpecialAgentSkye: Wasnt it the google docs sheet you had ?
SpecialAgentSkye: @georgehotz
bufferovrflw: George, I believe it was FASTA
11plus4thinking: @bufferovrflw ok :)
fukurowlz: @mashafique to lear a lot of bio
bufferovrflw: FASTA
pz3300: Apparently Corona is making people play poker there was 300k players on stars tonight
Nussinov: @georgehotz https://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/Q9BYF1#interaction here's a great site if you haven't been here yet
fukurowlz: learn*

mrflurriesxvx: sorry i cant hear what youre saying
bufferovrflw: @georgehotz It's FASTA, iirc
williamjennings1: what is he even doing lmao
pistolpetepcp: He's looking for genomes that were cleaved
yevheniiushtyk: maybe it
brittonx2: I thought the furin did the cleaving...
georgecruece: how is the progress everyone
logi6000: the one with the map of where it came from
Lana_Lux: @JustAsGoodJo ah cool! thanks for the insight :)
mrflurriesxvx: i cant hear youuuuuuu
SpecialAgentSkye: @georgehotz Wasnt it the google sheets doc you had open?
brittonx2: the furin is on the host side

JustAsGoodJo: @georgecruece lanaluHuh LUL
JMSWRNR: monkaS
mashafique: @fukurowlz I wouldn't say you can deeply learn a lot of bio in two days. Probably just cram enough info to be able to work with it

localcanofdutchgold: @zak_krack don't tell him 5Head
mrflurriesxvx: sexy beast
pistolpetepcp: To be honest, you need a high iq to even watch this
dj_vicio: @yevheniiushtyk HE IS talking to himself during the stream all the time
11plus4thinking: @yevheniiushtyk he def does
fukurowlz: @mashafique if u want to work with a specific topic of bio, i think that two days will be enough
bananacat98: you can do it!!!!
alycia: LuvHearts
SpecialAgentSkye: @yevheniiushtyk I think all developers do. I explain things out loud to myself so i understand them better
georgecruece: i can totally follow him, dont u? ArgieB8
yevheniiushtyk: nothing wrong with that i do too while i code so was just wondering haha
dj_vicio: yes, we all do
vaskogomez87: dlandlasndnsdd "ENTER"
mashafique: @fukurowlz Two days is enough to develop a working knowledge but I don't think that knowledge will last if you don't review it. It's not a one and done thing.
saintmthw: @yevheniiushtyk auditory learner?
11plus4thinking: 11 🤔
SpecialAgentSkye: me :) I skipped 11 :)
Mariosavitch: git commit -am 'Skip 11'
dj_vicio: but geohotz even yells and fights at himself
Mariosavitch: git blame china
zak_krack: this protein doesn't go up to 11
Winnepooh_: I usually just repeat "how can I be so stupid?" when I code, not sure if it helps
georgecruece: i has eaten 11
Amaz1ngLALALA: 11 monkaS
AresRai:  4 🤔
saintmthw: the coldlight oracle
Nussinov: @georgehotz check to see if some of the proteins are encoded on the other strand of dna
parktype: 11 Pepehands
yevheniiushtyk: 🤔 WHO
logi6000: is it the site with the timeline and where the virus came from
StriderKeni: StriderKeni subscribed with Twitch Prime. They've subscribed for 3 months! Cheers from Chile! evo19Chile
TrippinFlare: grep "11"
Mariosavitch: well 7, 8, 9 so maybe 7 did
fukurowlz: @mashafique yeah, sure, but i mean that is a good time to start with it
Juankinator: bush did coronavirus

fukurowlz: @StriderKeni saludos, de chile tambien <3
georgecruece: damn, he is just learning biology on google :( :( :(
Mariosavitch: can you look at the commit history of the virus
edu4594: obama did corona
ahahahaitslit: lmfao
logi6000: is it the site with the Timeline and where the Corona came from?
SpecialAgentSkye: @Mariosavitch but 5 sexed 7, so maybe 5 was in on it too?
fa_k: geohot did bioinformatics did he?
zak_krack: @georgecruece you can learn a lot from google / stackoverflow, even at the top levels
pomprocks: solving biology is like solving artificial intelligence. but harder
fa_k: nice rarted take brother
zak_krack: engine roar
KruptWorld: @pomprocks what is he solving in biology exactly?
georgecruece: @zak_krack but he hasn't written a line of code for half an hour :( :( :(
ad5k: Weren’t a lot of contributors to bioinformatics CS people who learned some basic bio
mashafique: @fukurowlz That's true. It's a good enough time to get a working knowledge to build upon.
yevheniiushtyk: so y'all think coronavirus (sars ig) could be bio engineered in a lab, or is actually from people eating bats?
logi6000: is it the site with the map of where corona cane from
Nussinov: @georgehotz wrong exonuclease is not related to exon. exo refers to the directionality of the mechanism of degradation of the enzyme
dj_vicio: go check the rice before you burn the house
dj_vicio: see? he talks to himself all the time
dj_vicio: never talks to the streamers
ninjadidio: :D
toasty_jk2: something with the ending "-ase" is an enzyme (a protei with a function)
fukurowlz: streamers?
fukurowlz: what

thejuror8: @yevheniiushtyk It's hard to know anyways. If it was intentionally released which is a crazy theory, then at least one unaligned government would have made a declaration, so it is reasonable to exclude this possibility. Then it could be accidental, but there is very little fact to support this theory as well

Mariosavitch: damn thats some depression era cooking
SpecialAgentSkye: Plain rice Kreygasm
Nussinov: ackxhpaez it was shown that it is very very unlikely it was an engineered bioweapon. https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/the-new-coronavirus-was-not-genetically-engineered-study-shows#Ending-the-rumors-about-SARS-CoV-2-
DecayingSkullz: soy sauce
yevheniiushtyk: @thejuror8 ah mb didnt finish reading lmao
dj_vicio: 10% copy/pasta
thejuror8: @yevheniiushtyk I do the same lmao
mescal33t: 🍚
brittonx2: http://www.virology.ws/2020/02/13/furin-cleavage-site-in-the-sars-cov-2-coronavirus-glycoprotein
dj_vicio: where's the protein lol
logi6000: @juankinator sorry to be excluding but I'm not sure you exactly fit in with this channel. go watch some gamer
zak_krack: i can't believe this guy hasn't visited stackoverflow, how does he get anything done?
DecayingSkullz: do you have any soylent
Mariosavitch: does it have a spike protein?
JefeBezos: Not even hot sauce?
dj_vicio: yea @Juankinator with all due respect GTFO
ackxhpaez: CCP propaganda!
11plus4thinking: @thejuror8 nah i would argue coding is 10% googling and 90% the person thinking of what questions to ask
SpecialAgentSkye: @dj_vicio 5% copy pasta. 2% cleanup. 3% praying it works.
georgecruece: he only eats rice? no other things?
Juankinator: @logi6000 its alright im joking
Nussinov: @georgehotz first hyperlink in this document is the nature article
fukurowlz: @zak_krack almost 10 years coding with python
logi6000: @zak_krack they haven't done this type of advanced shit yet
nic0latesla: you are cute
georgecruece: this man is weird HolidayCookie HolidayCookie
dj_vicio: @SpecialAgentSkye gotta be some % for "talking to yourself"
ited01: a
Mariosavitch: no
SpecialAgentSkye: Thats an async task @dj_vicio . It never stops. 100% talking to self LUL
Crayonsss: i assume u do this for fun? imagine what they pay people that work with this!
thejuror8: @georgehotz Nature would absolutely publish it if the article was of quality
bob_babyelephant: good stuff geo
JustAsGoodJo: i mean, nature might if it had 100 pages of supplemental
11plus4thinking: how can you enjoy plain rice DansGame
Nussinov: @georgehotz this is true, but not all evidence can be strong by nature of the situation
11plus4thinking: explain DansGame
zwisch: do you put anything in your rice?
ahahahaitslit: salt
dj_vicio: how can he eat with no water or chicken, veggies, etc.
zak_krack: yes a fork
KruptWorld: how do you determine if its lab created or not?
thejuror8: @georgehotz A previous paper supporting the theory was removed because the methodology was very weak
Tidusuper91: I'd put a bit of salmon.
SpecialAgentSkye: @zwisch A spoon Kappa
zak_krack: or a spoon
KruptWorld: is there like a signiture?
georgecruece: plz add something to.rice
dj_vicio: damn that bite hahahaha
zak_krack: LUL
bob_babyelephant: I like coding
yevheniiushtyk: well good to know he doesn't eat only takeout food lmao
toasty_jk2: just do a BLAST search and you will see it is 91% identical to the virus found in bats 2013
peter35_: news: lab origin conspiracy DEBUNKED
boneitis: !uptime
Usisuvach0: @KruptWorld it's visible if it's injected
JefeBezos: You’re not meant to eat the spoon too
fukurowlz: THE ASMR
thejuror8: @KruptWorld Sequencing and statistics, comparisons with existing specimens studied in said laboratories. It's easier than you think
dj_vicio: @peter35_ sauce?
SpecialAgentSkye: @JefeBezos Says who?
zak_krack: no sauce, it's plain rice
georgecruece: do u have a gf
KruptWorld: @georgehotz how does someone determine a lab created virus or not?
zak_krack: Kappa
Amaz1ngLALALA: WutFace
skieth028: hello there what ya doing?
peter35_: dj_vicio im saying how that's how they would blindly report on that paper george just had up
vaskogomez87: ah yes yes
11plus4thinking: @toasty_jk2 its really scary how viruses can mutate from animals to humans
zak_krack: i've got work tomorrow but I'm up watching this stream :(
logi6000: @zak_krack damn work
kevin99gh: is he trying jailbreak the corona wtf is this sourciYOUNGB
SpecialAgentSkye: @zak_krack Same. 3 hours till work FeelsGoodMan 🔫
KruptWorld: damn folding@home doesnt do corona yet
yevheniiushtyk: hm so sars had the potential to be even worse than coronavirus, but somehow it got stopped?
georgecruece: do u have biological background
thejuror8: @georgecruece He does not LUL that's going to be the main issue
Usisuvach0: @11plus4thinking it's also scary how bats get infected by it and mutates inside of them, but it does not harm the bats at all
vaskogomez87: @zak_krack me 2. 1:30am here
zak_krack: @SpecialAgentSkye I kinda feel I might learn more here than at work
Nussinov: @georgehotz one key insight is that COVID19 is derived from no coronaviruses known to be pathogenic, and the analyses show the pathogenic mutations occured within humans. it is very hard to believe that researchers that would "design" this virus would use a non pathogenic template and then PREDICT the downstream mutations to optimize for pathogenicity.
AresRai: @yevheniiushtyk more like sars exchanged mortality stats for reproductive stats
fizzword: hey
Juankinator: @georgecruece dont think so, hes learning as he goes i think
JustAsGoodJo: might have a different name
thejuror8: @Nussinov Damn I did not know that, that's spicy as fuck
11plus4thinking: @Usisuvach0 yep exactly, this is just the beginning
peter35_: i hate the word debunked
SpecialAgentSkye: @zak_krack I for sure will. Im at home, working on some ai stuff for ibm, that i cannot access because its not remotely accessable. I dont know what im paid for LUL
KruptWorld: @georgehotz are you working on setting up that church to hack nature at all or just been busy with other stuff?
zak_krack: yep @Juankinator . I love that, more people need to be able to explore new areas on the fly
georgecruece: he must be genius
bonzer66: @thejuror8 what is he writing? I just joined in like 10 mins ago
Usisuvach0: and bats are carrying god knows how much viruses in them
Nussinov: @thejuror8 the cutting edge is spicy as fuck, you should read more PogChamp
Juankinator: @zak_krack yep, google makes that easier too
11plus4thinking: @SpecialAgentSkye free money TriHard
Usisuvach0: all of the COV viruses are from bats
Usisuvach0: MERS, SARS, and this one
thejuror8: @bonzer66 Just scrambling around with the genetic code of Coronavirus, he's learning
Nussinov: Usisuvach0 where did you hear that?
SpecialAgentSkye: @zak_krack But they wont fire me because it would take too long to get someone else into the exact project (extension for watson). So im not getting fired LUL
georgecruece: does he have the machine to cook the vaccine
Usisuvach0: hear?
SpecialAgentSkye: @11plus4thinking TriHard 7 Rise up
Usisuvach0: it's everywhere
Usisuvach0: read about it
thejuror8: @Nussinov Yeah I know nothing about genomics, I mostly read ML papers these days
dj_vicio: @SpecialAgentSkye you work for IBM?
Usisuvach0: but the infection to humans is not from bats directly
Usisuvach0: it's from intermediate host
thejuror8: @georgecruece LUL don't be crazy
Usisuvach0: MERS was from camilla
zak_krack: what is spider beer?
Usisuvach0: SARS from civets
nic0latesla: i love this guy
Nussinov: @thejuror8 ML concepts are commonly used in genomics
SpecialAgentSkye: @dj_vicio yea. Its not fun at all. As much as it might sound like a nice workplace
zak_krack: Is that a default chromium link
Usisuvach0: this one they say it's from pangolin
thejuror8: Cmon Hotz just do [:-1] like a man
Usisuvach0: but they are not sure yet
yevheniiushtyk: Coronavirus are usually pretty harmless viruses right? When our nose gets runny etc, that's all coronaviruses as far as i know? Thats why they renamed it to sars cov?
thejuror8: @Nussinov That's cool
fizzword: what is jupyter?
Usisuvach0: but the first host is bat
brownyyyylocks: i made fried rice with bokchoy jalapenos and sesame seed oil
brownyyyylocks: it was amazing
logi6000: imma have to go it's been nice talking to you guys
JustAsGoodJo: easy way to run python code vs. using the terminal @fizzword
georgecruece: it is online python editing platform
zak_krack: yep @yevheniiushtyk this is the world's first pandemic coronavirus
Nussinov: @thejuror8 in fact most of the biosciences now use ML, given the 'big data' praxis
Juankinator: @fizzword python IDE
fizzword: oh, cool. thanks
SpecialAgentSkye: @brownyyyylocks You just made me hungry. I hope your next commit fails the CI pipeline 😡
KruptWorld: @fizzword its make developing for data easier and you can run lines of code instead of having to recompile it all
bananacat98: I have no idea what is going on but his typing sure is relaxing FortBush
dj_vicio: georgehotz researches/RE Corona while drinking bath soup
georgecruece: jupyter sucks
Juankinator: @georgecruece amen to that
KruptWorld: @Juankinator damn that a nice simple way to say it haha
1ntegral_: @fizzword you both code and text in markdown format it's used a lot in Data Science
dontusethiscode: @brownyyyylocks i made fresh pasta with bat and tomato sauce
georgecruece: total messy codes after certain time
yevheniiushtyk: I'm staying careful during this pandemic, since I don't have my 30% of lungs to be permanently damaged, on other side, USA is gonna get it bad I think
Juankinator: @KruptWorld haha you did explain it better
yevheniiushtyk: *don't want
zak_krack: i want to see the diff of those two strings
SpecialAgentSkye: Bath soup drink rice while researching geohotz /RE Corono
JustAsGoodJo: might have differences in residues
Danilok100: !uptime
Nussinov: @georgecruece messy brain
dongmuya: Is what Hotz working on have anything to do with what Folding@Home is advertising? Borrowing your idle GPU/CPU?
thejuror8: @Nussinov That's very exciting. I'm kinda hoping to get an opening in Bioinformatics using my soon to be solid background in ML
pistolpetepcp: this is the glycoprotien that binds to the ACE2 receptor?
almonte550: Let's do edit distance to it
brownyyyylocks: lets hope bitbucket goes down
thejuror8: @Nussinov It's a very interesting domain for sure
zak_krack: does anyone else keep trying to copy   paste things off of george's stream
KruptWorld: haha true
dontusethiscode: where is Alex @georgehotz
georgecruece: @nussinov i like codes are split into files in traditional IDE
brownyyyylocks: thats it im starting a cooking stream
thejuror8: @georgecruece If you try it you will see how practical it is with Python, it's a lot better
fizzword: @yevheniiushtyk as far as I know your lungs only get damaged if you start showing serious symptoms, which would only happen if you have a preexisting condition
georgecruece: pycharm is nice
Nussinov: @georgehotz you might want to try a multiple sequence alignment. there are web tools
thejuror8: @georgecruece Almost no reason to use something else
Maxmemix: Whats the goal here?
KruptWorld: @Maxmemix im trying to figure it out
thejuror8: @Maxmemix Having fun   learning I guess
Bo0sted05: yea what are you trying to do
360Plato: https://msa.biojs.net/ check this out
SpecialAgentSkye: If its made by jetbrains, you know its prolly top tier imo
georgecruece: @thejuror8 it is just good to do small tests in jupyter
ak0ya_: to understand I guess at this point
thejuror8: Lol guys this stream is just not going to be a 24 hours DSLAM coding session, just get on with that
ak0ya_: to formulate a problem?
yevheniiushtyk: @fizzword ah okay, still it's important not to be ignorant during this pandemic, made me mad how people labeled it as "oh it's just an flu" when it started
thejuror8: @georgecruece Yeah it's just very very practical
JustAsGoodJo: yeah sequence alignment allows for miss matches like indels and gives scores
KruptWorld: i think its to find what will bind to it and destroy it
nashesvobodnoye: I would be bored to sleep... Guess thats why i'm not George Hotz
yevheniiushtyk: bruh im hungry af over here and this mad b eating all the time
yevheniiushtyk: man
georgecruece: why do americans also eat rice ArgieB8
georgecruece: it is weird
yevheniiushtyk: don't we all ove rice
yevheniiushtyk: love
Waywoah: Why wouldn't we eat rice?
leesingods: Rice = best side
brownyyyylocks: side? bruh main dish
brittonx2: http://www.virology.ws/2020/02/13/furin-cleavage-site-in-the-sars-cov-2-coronavirus-glycoprotein/
georgecruece: i thought u ate hamburgers everyday :( :( :(
dj_vicio: it's not about the tools. It's about Methodology.
SpecialAgentSkye: @yevheniiushtyk People are still saying its just a flu because they dont understand how pandemic research and statistics work. Comparisons of #cases to deaths is fundamentally wrong, but thats their argument. Its #cured vs deaths that matters. Rest is a buffer for death or cured. (cured = beat the virus as you cant "cure" a virus)
JustAsGoodJo: tools give us high dimensional data that is inherently difficult for most people to find structure within
SpecialAgentSkye: People tend to live in their own narratives. Sad really.
mlgdotca: did he cure it yet
justdoityourself: It's all about the cleavage sites... simple LUL.
Lizardan: @mlgdotca he cured his hunger :)

JBirch10: ever thought to find a chemist/virologist to help understand what you are looking at??
georgecruece: is he reading a paper ArgieB8
skieth028: can anyone explain what is he doing? is he like trying to remake the virus? XD
gollosadstation: found anything yet?
sillybaboy: how are you gonna reverse engineer a virus just based off of sources you don't know can be trusted?
fafws321: How do you undersand those biological terms? Do you have a minor or smt???
T3chHS: Does george has biology background?
yevheniiushtyk: I love how my country (Czech Republic), has been handling this, compared to other EU countries I think we have it pretty good. They immediately started to take action, school were closed almost immediately, public gatherings, social distancing
thejuror8: @SpecialAgentSkye Cases is still very relevant if compared to the total available hospital beds, it's when cases exceed this total that death tolls skyrockets
KruptWorld: lol
SpecialAgentSkye: Yo you prolly wont see this, but i still think your rap talents BEAST @georgehotz LUL That light it up contest was sick to this day
brittonx2: http://www.virology.ws/2020/02/13/furin-cleavage-site-in-the-sars-cov-2-coronavirus-glycoprotein/
Nussinov: You don't need a biology background to be skeptical of a paper
pistolpetepcp: isolation_source = "fecal swab " LOL
georgecruece: @t3chhs yes he has doctor degree in biology
dj_vicio: he understand them because he's geohotz man! How dare you?!

thejuror8: @georgehotz Hey give us an example
georgecruece: u get corona. everybody get away now!
PeepRL: corona virus
Tomishima: woman
SpecialAgentSkye: @thejuror8 Correct, but looking solely on these numbers for a conclusion of the "deathlyness" of the virus is wrong is what im trying to say
leesingods: If you look for the Cure the virus has a defense mechanism which is why he is coughing...
PeepRL: whoops. coronga* virus
brownyyyylocks: we need AI Scientists
thejuror8: @SpecialAgentSkye That's fair

thejuror8: @georgehotz Hey give us an example of a scrambled interview question of yours please
vaskogomez87: @georgehotz yeah give us an example

Tomishima: funny but is true
DatBrownKid999: Hey george can you do my C homework for me?
brownyyyylocks: orange juice and bongo drum
theonlymonkas: richard feynman is cool
Juankinator: honestly i always saw biology as just a shit ton of stuff to memorize
Ghost_001: monkaS
Abnico: what sauce is in that rice
JBirch10: why not find a virologist who is already working on this to see if you are on to something??
jagger_rsw: @georgehotz feynman on this - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFIYKmos3-s - "Richard Feynman - Names Don't Constitute Knowledge"
JustAsGoodJo: @peter35_ i'm a computational biologist. there's mathematics in biology lol
Tomishima: wlaking wikipedia
pistolpetepcp: Yea it's like physics, you can say you slipped on water, but you need to ask why
11plus4thinking: feynman FeelsBadMan
Skriance: what about engineers

pedrovictortech: Yep we are listening from the speaker
thejuror8: KEKW TRUE
brownyyyylocks: yo my theory has always been geohot is feynman reincarnated
SpecialAgentSkye: @KruptWorld You need to realize he is not a biologist. Im pretty sure he couldnt tell you. He is a developer, winging biology using google, and the knowledgeable people in chat
JustAsGoodJo: i think people just like to sound smart
KruptWorld: oh thanks @SpecialAgentSkye
Nussinov: feynman wrote about his time doing biological research, some very interesting insights. they ring even more true now that google and online biological databases exist
mashafique: As someone who has a degree in Physics and Mathematics memorizing doesn't get you anywhere. If you don't understand what you're doing it doesn't matter. You can memorize all the equations and theorems you want but if you don't know how they work you're not gonna get anywhere meaningful.

360Plato: maybe not relatively
thejuror8: @georgehotz It just means that computational analysis of proteic binding is not perfect
u1337ochka: yo @georgehotz are you going to Joe Rogan for a podcast?
tehEGO: maybe interaction is the premise that they would be in that scenario
thejuror8: @georgehotz Probably very far from that actually
dj_vicio: cant read
ahahahaitslit: can't sees hit

Juankinator: joe rogan will just ask you about ai and the terminator scenario
tehEGO: maybe it would be better that papers like this should be refactored to as lamens as possible
Vindalis: george will be the first one to develop an autonomous vaccine for the coronavirus
360Plato: @dontusethiscode what would they even talk about JBP is zonked in rehab
leesingods: You could just go back to normal after the interview what would chage?
Lizardan: Rogan would be the worst podcast for someone like George. Rogan is a comedian.
AresRai: joe will ask about DMT and terminator
raystriker98: Joe Rogan is dumb af
mashafique: To me it just seems like you're just too nitpicky with words. At the end of the every field has a way of talking and if you haven't actually studied that field it doesn't make sense to expect ot understand the way that they are communicating. Also, since a lot of the stuff you loo k at is not aimed just for the average person. It's for people in the field.
Nussinov: @georgehotz I think what is being said is that - using the state of the art computational analyses, one could not reverse engineer the virus seen
PiroFloydian: this was legible the xkcd wasnt @georgehotz
KruptWorld: its maybe saying although its the current form is the most optimized for it its not the best one that can be made for interactions... like the predictive models found better ones?

thejuror8: Guys cmon, this paper is probably of very good quality. Very little people in this stream, including George, have the knowledge required to understand it, so let's say humble
Nussinov: @georgehotz there is loads of literature on synthetic biology and the generation of proteins with specific degrees of binding affinity
bufferovrflw: @georgehotz Any review on the papers?
abhinavneelam: prove the shortest distance between two points is the distance formula
bufferovrflw: *any reviews
chillguy269: Does it have an abstract of what the paper is actually trying to demonstrate?
AresRai: yea
ak0ya_: what exact question are you trying to answer with this paper? @georgehotz
mysterykiller1234: no.
mrhdr: explain
360Plato: its all approximates
dontusethiscode: no
raystriker98: these are peer reviewed?
AresRai: its very vague
Lizardan: @thejuror8 exactly. the wording is not for tech people
Nussinov: I see why you're skeptical but you do not have domain expertise
haroldakme: Why is the computer programmer trying decipher a medical paper
jagger_rsw: remind us :) why are we buying your subscriptions? is it something like if you take over the world you won't kill us (first) or sth else? :)

Ozonemaster: what do they even mean by optimized
Mariosavitch: written by the chinese
11plus4thinking: lab scenario what does that mean 🤔

Ozonemaster: there are so many things in nature "optimized"
skieth028: are you guys really serious? this is twitch.. hes not really revese engineering the coronavirus... LUL if he is on a lab the might believe it.. like LUL
KruptWorld: in before paper is debunked!
Ozonemaster: thats jus a retarded adjective
ak0ya_: that was produced in the lab
Nussinov: @georgehotz you do not need more evidence than what they referred to LUL it is more or less obvious
Lizardan: @georgehotz It would be awesome if you could invite an infectious disease doctor to your stream and help you with this.
thejuror8: @georgehotz It's very speculative but it's a bio paper, the format is very different from a mathcomp sci. paper of course
ak0ya_: it could still be evolved in the lab
mashafique: People in the field are aware of which lab methods and techniques are available so they would know what would be doable at this time
THX1342: there's no explanation of what the signature of a 'lab based virus' is
raystriker98: I guess bio papers allows for speculation
Mariosavitch: weird flex, but ok
Lizardan: Different from com-sci and math. yeah 4Head

Mariosavitch: it contextually makes sense
skieth028: @AresRai hmmm yummy LUL
dj_vicio: lack of details in the Corona paper because they dont know shit about the virus yet but yet they want to comply with something to filter out dumb vs smart ppl believing in their "facts".
tehEGO: its not a paper
PiroFloydian: @georgehotz fission said it, this is a letter to the editor not a paper
davedavidsonfromdavis: does anyone know what percent of bio papers can't be replicated??
Nussinov: @georgehotz its still subjective LUL you understand the domain-specific jargon better and are therefore more comfortable
tehEGO: no it says at the top its not a paper
pistolpetepcp: can we replicate the virus infection lol, i volunteer
shlver: @georgehotz you need to simulate the environment of inside of the human body, it's impossible to simulate the interactions or other cofactors in the human body. When they say computational analyses they are doing electrostatic interactions between the simple interactions of structure only.
Juankinator: maybe bio papers have stuff that is harder to replicate
ak0ya_: There are good papers
bigie: the ones that stack 10 refinement networks and don't publish code or trained models
ak0ya_: of course
AresRai: some bio papers are very good
Nussinov: this is a letter to the editor

Tomishima: just 5000 ppl global
dongmuya: nextstraing.com
Abnico: gonna start a biotech company
Tomishima: is the find ppl that understand this shit
shlver: @georgehotz the sequence doesn't exist in a vacuum, how the proteins fold depends on its environment and that environment is in the human body. We know coronavirus binds ACE2 because we can see viral load increasing, computational analyses is limited in scope and cannot take into account the cofactors and physiological factors that could contribute to the change in the structure of the glycoprotein and uptake of viral rna.
Abnico: next bull market biotech will be the new crypto

logi6000: @williamjennings1 do you have the money
pedrovictortech: @williamjennings1 depends on what you want to do
teslost: @shlver is not protein folding still one of the unsolved problems because of the computational complexity?
justdoityourself: @Jehhred do it because you love it
Juankinator: @Jehhred get people that know how to code well to review your code, or check source code from big projects that are well done

raystriker98: mutations are usually useless until that one mutation "evolves" it
yevheniiushtyk: like i have been fiddling with code for so long but I haven't made any significant progress, this stream really made me want to pursue coding more seriously and learn all the things
xPolarDreamz: @Lizardan reverse engineerring what
badmyt: this is ridiculous how fast it mutates, how should the vaccine stop it anyhow if it changes itself a thousand of times daily
myaocat: mutation - the changing of the structure of a gene, resulting in a variant form that may be transmitted to subsequent generations, caused by the alteration of single base units in DNA, or the deletion, insertion, or rearrangement of larger sections of genes or chromosomes.
tokumei64: mutation is just any change in the genetic code iiuc
KruptWorld: bro programming is just logic
Usisuvach0: L is the dangerous one
Nussinov: KruptWorld not really
Jewishrambo: if it mutates wouldn't it get weaker because it has had more transmission chains, but if its more lethal less mutation chance idk
dongmuya: L Mutated from S
Crypod: results on masks FailFish
Usisuvach0: S is the mild one
KruptWorld: learn logic and then you can translate that between languages
dongmuya: L is the newer one
Usisuvach0: no
KruptWorld: why not @Nussinov
Usisuvach0: L is the dangerous

Nussinov: @georgehotz you are misattributing the behaviour of "biologists" to the behaviour of novel science. mistakes are made in all fields, especially in the situation where the science is SEXY and must be published quickly. not all math or ML papers lead to worthwhile results either. while some papers provide significantly more information that others, science is accumulate

Snowlav: thisuserisdeleted bits still get flipped often
xPolarDreamz: i need some free energy

thisuserisdeleted: ain't nobody gonna flip my bits
l1ght5p33d: any study can be flawed and have all the p values you want
Snowlav: thisuserisdeleted u new to cs?
KruptWorld: @AleexM im trying to re-learn about it too. i heard about it when it came out on the ps3 and i would fold@home with it.
thisuserisdeleted: @Snowlav yes
Snowlav: ok makes sense then
thejuror8: The fact that p-values are misused does NOT mean that they should be banished altogether. They are still a great tool
thisuserisdeleted: im new how can i make sense
hellonearthis: Sounds like something from the tv show "Devs"
myaocat: https://reason.com/video/biohackers-are-on-a-secret-hunt-for-the-coronavirus-vaccine/
Snowlav: thisuserisdeleted u don't that's the point
myaocat: Is this real?
nikudino: its exponential, we need quantum
raystriker98: quantum computing levels of compute
dongmuya: Theres no P values in heaven
THX1342: @georgehotz did you check the mRNA vaccine video?
shlver: @georgehotz the structure changes depending on ph. the pka of certain amino acids determines their electroengativity
thisuserisdeleted: yes @Snowlav
Nussinov: @georgehotz are you a frequentist or bayesian thinker Kappa
McAze: disgusting
lemonboxed: you can compute for as long as you want , doesnt mean you will ever make a working simulation
pistolpetepcp: I have a big p-value
Michaeltth: HackerMan
Mariosavitch: Co-Author: George Hotz
thisuserisdeleted: so i guess i was right there are different strains going around
dj_vicio: seems legit
KruptWorld: @AleexM so what i know so far is that after the protein is shitted out in a straight line it just starts to 'fold' on it self. and we are running simulations to simulate that random folding on itself to get the right fold
thiefer20: George Shkreli

justdoityourself: p-values == wrath of khan protomatter
theonlymonkas: martin hotz

thisuserisdeleted: i m not gonna take the cure if it involves suppositories
lemonboxed: dna vaccines are stupid
swagomgswag: i would for money
l1ght5p33d: find set of all possible folds
Nussinov: just inject that plasmid right up into those cells Kreygasm
luigifrcruz: I don't think these guys have Class 4 Labs..
shlver: @georgehotz the structure changes depending on ph. the pka of certain amino acids determines their electronegativity. High temperature, excessive changes in pH causes differing changes to structure.
Nussinov: ill show you my f-pilus if you show me yours Kreygasm
myaocat: They are making it..(producing it), they are not testing it because it's cost a lot money

KruptWorld: wait @georgehotz, wouldnt simulating the physics between atoms enough to simulate proteins? or anything for that matter? do we really have to get quantium? i think quantium is just for collapsing the infinite amount of wave functions, if im not mistaken...
Mariosavitch: great movie
MorningScifi: It's literally SARS 2
lemonboxed: the protein doesnt respond to the immune system thats like down a different chain
lemonboxed: proteins just make stuff
theonlymonkas: !uptime
l1ght5p33d: need quantum because tunneling
AresRai: @hellonearthis its because it contain zinc   something else that allow zinc to go through cells, which slow the ATP process and slow reproduction of the virus according to a video
thisuserisdeleted: theres a lot of sars related diseases tho
Iknowyou123456789: what is your WPM? @georgehotz
luigifrcruz: I think the immune system is trying to bind with the spike protein to prevent it to bind with pulmonary cells.
l1ght5p33d: classical solution is not the same as quantum for small systems like optical tweezer
myaocat: @lemonboxed i read that protein inject to the body and try to make antibodies.. something like that
theonlymonkas: KappaRoss

edu4594: they used word...isn't even latex
myaocat: @hitmanhax probability is 50%

Nussinov: written like a narcissistic undergraduate Kappa
cankunwang: Every saw Jamal Murray's video?
barbadose: I actually don't think antibodies (B-cell response) are too important as a mechanism of defense against the virus, most viruses require a strong T-cell response
