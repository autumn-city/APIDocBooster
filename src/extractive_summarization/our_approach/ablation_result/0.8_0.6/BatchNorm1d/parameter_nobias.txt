As per the documentation we need to specify num_features parameter which is the input size of tensor. 
 So yeah, I here insert batch norm after the  linear layer, notice that there's a one D, it may be  confusing.  Why is there a one D? 
For both functions, the d1 parameter is the number of features, and equals dim C of the input tensor. 
It takes input of shape (N, *, I) and returns (N, *, O), where I stands for input dimension and O for output dim and * are any dimensions between.
