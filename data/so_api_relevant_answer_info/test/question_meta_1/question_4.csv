,Here is the official documentation for PyTorch's BatchNorm:,how does BatchNorm1d() method whithin the torch library work?,<python><pytorch><torch>,www.stackoverflow.com/questions/61193517,"I'm learning pytorch, I don;t know if this question is stupid but I can't find the official web for explaining nn.batchnorm1d. I'm wondering how torch.nn.BatchNorm1d(d1) work? I know that batch norm is about making mean and variance of a batch of example to be 0 and 1 respectively. I'm wondering if there is nn.batchnorm2d, if so, what does it do? what is the d1 parameter ?
