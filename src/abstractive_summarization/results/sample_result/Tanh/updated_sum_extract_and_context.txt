[Augmented API documentation]
------------------------
This API is <Tanh> in pytorch library.

[Function]: Applies the Hyperbolic Tangent (Tanh) function element-wise. Tanh is defined as: [function]

In neural network applications, the Tanh function serves as an activation function to convert the input value into a non-linear form and keeps it in the range of -1 to 1. It's a hyperbolic tangent that expands the range from -1 to 1, making it useful for problems that need to extend the limit from 1 to minus 1. The peculiarity of Tanh is that it is an exponential function in terms of Z and its derivative can be represented as 1 minus the square of the output. The graphical representation of Tanh indicates its range from minus 1 to 1, allowing it to handle negative values.

[Parameter]: Input:(∗), where ∗ means any number of dimensions. Output:(∗), same shape as the input.

Tanh only takes one argument, a tensor. If an error occurs, it's likely due to the incorrect argument type given, ensuring the input is in the correct format to avoid errors. 

[Notes]: None

Although Tanh is slower than ReLU for many examples, it produces more natural-looking fits for data using only linear inputs. Most times, Tanh converges faster and performs with better accuracy than the sigmoid and logistic function[^1^]. It's a good neuron unit that's bounded, easily differentiable, monotonic (good for convex optimization), and easy to handle. Despite this, the sigmoid and tanh functions tend to saturate, causing large values to snap to 1.0 and smaller values to snap to -1 or 0 for Tanh and sigmoid respectively[^1^]. It's interesting to note, though, that based on observation, Tanh and ReLU activation functions are more performant than sigmoid [^1^].
