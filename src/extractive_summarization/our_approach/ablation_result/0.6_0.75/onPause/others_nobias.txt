 And let's see what happens when config changes, how it affects the activity.  So, on configuration change, the Android first shuts down the activity by calling method in sequence, that is onPause, then onStop and then onDestroy. 
For instance, an activity can be visible but partially obscured by a dialog that has focus.  In that case, onPause() will be called, but not onStop(). When the dialog goes away, the activity's onResume() method will be called (but not onStart()).
On other hands, if some new Activity occurs and occupies the full screen so that your previously running activity is disappeared.  In this Case, your previously running activity is moved to Back Stack. Here, onPause() + onStop() are called.
For example, it is not uncommon to implement one with an Activity whose theme is set to that of a dialog.  In this case, displaying the dialog-as-an-Activity will cause the new Activity to be on the top of the stack, pausing what previously was there.
Then Activity A's state changes from paused to stopped state (which calls  onStop on Activity A) .  onStop is called because Activity B was full screen  non transparent activity. (If Activity B is non-full-sized or transparent then onStop is NOT called on Activity A)
