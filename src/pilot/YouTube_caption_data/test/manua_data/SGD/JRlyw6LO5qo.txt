thejuror8: that's x_i - log(sum(x_j)) tho
RichyK1: ArbitRandomUser1 Why wouldn't he just use his favorite IDE and run python there ? i.e vscode, vim etc..
thejuror8: what's with that expression
senpagax: @ArbitRandomUser1 just checked out zygote, that's crazy you can even differentiate functions with control flow
Kilkelly: the example on that page is confusing me DansGame
fabh2o: @richyk1 he can execute small code portion and keep result in memory instead of running the whole program each time
RichyK1: gotcha
Tyl3r44: just do cross entropy as function and another function for the derivative

peabu423: do you hide in the basement?
grekiki1234: mse is much easier to differentiate
Tyl3r44: write crossentropy first bro
ein_echter_depp: @foosballs just bring the derivative inside (if sum is finite this is trivial) if infinite then you have to ensure convergence
ArbitRandomUser1: why not use JAX ?
JdPaulBlart: just use the step function
ArbitRandomUser1: or autograd

bojandragic: tes
calcmath: hey george, what is your opinion on companies making dedicated large chips just for training neural networks?
not__awful: @aegrah , @bichid69 finished machine learning by andrew ng, are there some resources you would recommend?
vishnuvj8: Hey man!!
neehack: @georgehotz should I stream?
haizse: should i learn tensorflow or pytorch?
daMayor: neehack read his bio here
Crime_Stein: coding in the laundry room? lets go boys
almostquiet: musky laundry
Aegrah: @not__awful honestly I only learnt this stuff to write my master thesis, I didn't check interesting resources other than random google searches
caster64o: LETS CODE GEORGE WOOOOOOOOO
calcmath: wait you are cheating isee torch.nn being used
carlosdanker: ^
powerofpickle: Why is chat so quiet today
almostquiet: you have a woman that cooks for you george?
bojandragic: opa george boy z cko
not__awful: @aegrah I salute You
carlosdanker: daddy found mommy
dreamer_trinity333: *cant see these stupid people talking*
haizse: is that mrs hotz in the background?
powerofpickle: I didn't see any chat until I just refreshed
willarkitekt: A quiet chat is a good chat
bichid69: @not__awful deep learning book
Apoplect1c: no no no no it's all wrong
TusKaN_BaNaNas: @not__awful https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf and fast ai courses https://www.fast.ai/ might interest you
bojandragic: is fastai worth it?
caster64o: SeemsGood
bojandragic: just for fun
djceci: it seems there is a shit ton of math in ai if ya dont use some ready modules
not__awful: ahh Goodfellow, thank you @bichid69
Apoplect1c: The wall looks cold
calcmath: calculus = shit tonnes of math LOL
not__awful: @tuskan_bananas also thankful
djceci: ya calculus for now dude
TusKaN_BaNaNas: deep learning from foundations by fastai is decent you do similar things to what george is doing here
calcmath: dRelu = sign(x)
Apoplect1c: no
djceci: just wait for the complex math
Apoplect1c: x = x
dreamer_trinity333: @Apoplect1c the wall must keep all the heat beaming off his head from melting everything around him
grekiki1234: drelu =1 if x>0 else 0
Apoplect1c: yep
djceci: i see why you are happy though @calcmath :)
bojandragic: meth
jagger_rsw: jagger_rsw subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 7 month streak! Is it still the deal that subscribers will not be sent to gulags, when you take over the world?
calcmath: lol @djceci I am sorry i dont know your background, but neural net math is fairly simple if you knew calculus etc
powerofpickle: I highly recommend sympy if you haven't used it. It's like symbolab in a python library
louvadeus2: x' = 1
carlosdanker: ReLU is very simple func
dreamer_trinity333: *slurps drink*
otor0: yes that's part of why it works so well, the gradient flows right through
grizvok: grizvok subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 8 months, currently on a 1 month streak!
haizse: derivative of x is just 1
xrealyy: she is your thing actually wow
grekiki1234: drelu =1 if x>0 else 0
R31gnh: LUL
johhnythehobo: if cnn then fake=news
calcmath: backprop for relu is you take the dx coming backwards and zero out the entires that had negative pre activations
PrinceArthur: epic
ein_echter_depp: it must be hard to try and do deep learning when you dont understand math
powerofpickle: Yes relu is computationally simple, that is why it is used
calcmath: no its used because t works
powerofpickle: ^ that too
calcmath: it has less vanishing gradient issues
nicovzq: r u on the cloud George?
Apoplect1c: :)
ein_echter_depp: http://www.maeckes.nl/Signum%20functie%20GB.html
carlosdanker: cloud 9
Apoplect1c: potato muncher
Apoplect1c: WI know what to do
ein_echter_depp: ^^Derv of sign(x)
grekiki1234: drelu is good
Apoplect1c: She is a good chef
powerofpickle: squidward tortellini
haizse: damn a personal chef
ein_echter_depp: derv is 0, if x <=0, else 1
bichid69: RELU IS NOT A CONTINUOUS FUNCTION BRO, CAN'T BE DIFFERENTIATED
Zamytv21: Hey whatsupp big fan!!! @georgehotz
sendmeintothevoid: is this a new girl or the old girl
Apoplect1c: BRO NO DIFFERENTENTION
powerofpickle: nah its just undefined at 0
bichid69: YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE THE DERIV AT X=0
ein_echter_depp: it has a removable discontinuity
Apoplect1c: DIVIRI
Apoplect1c: BRO
ein_echter_depp: so you can just define the derv at 0
powerofpickle: ^
ein_echter_depp: define it to be zero
bojandragic: too much math unsubbin rn
bichid69: BRO YES EXACTLY DEFINE IT TO WHATEVER
grizvok: you arent subbed
Aegrah: BROO
ein_echter_depp: this way, left and right dervs match
Apoplect1c: Just remove DIVIRI and do X >= 0
bojandragic: :leko grin:
Apoplect1c: sry: X >= 1
Aegrah: JUST CHOOSE THE DERIV AT X=0 BROO
haizse: BROO
powerofpickle: why is this shocking
Apoplect1c: NO
bichid69: X>0 DERIV = X, X<=0 DERIV = 0
ein_echter_depp: yea it is not shocking at all
aadi_sam: @bojandragic yeah too much math and too little meth.
Apoplect1c: LUL after all that good comments he reads my crap first :p
grekiki1234: drelu is fine
thommy_exile: what pc do you have ??? @georgehotz
powerofpickle: bro pretty sure relu evolves into lucario
bojandragic: trash can mac mb
dreamer_trinity333: looks like a mac
haizse: pretty sure he uses a macbook
Bloodspark_: @powerofpickle lmao
Aegrah: but BRO
bichid69: torch does chain rule for you
Apoplect1c: the diviri bro
Apoplect1c: I just bought a new game but this is more entertaining
forthouearth: #Georgy4TwitchPartner
otor0: you have to zero out the entries where the input to the relu are < 0
Apoplect1c: ^
pyentropy: suup
bichid69: chain rule is basically y = g(f(x)), then dy/dx = dy/dg * dg/dx
thommy_exile: can someone explain what is he doing atm ?
dirtygarbageeater: george sick fedoras in the back my man
shieeeeeeeeet: @bichid69 what happened to CAPS BRO
bichid69: dgs "cancel"
Apoplect1c: Mr. Yamaku?
aadi_sam: @thommy_exile lunch
basen_: yan le cun
TusKaN_BaNaNas: Yann Lecun
bichid69: CHAIN RULE IS BASICALLY Y = G(F(X)), THEN DY/DX = DY/DG * DG/DX
carlosdanker: they won't Kappa @thommy_exile
St47ik: HeyGuys
krakendmp: krakendmp subscribed with Prime. They've subscribed for 4 months!
dirtygarbageeater: dirtygarbageeater subscribed at Tier 1.
bichid69: @shieeeeeeeeet HAPPY BRO?
Exclamation_mark_CODE: i did :)
paradox109: Yann Andr√© LeCun is a French computer scientist working primarily in the fields of machine learning, computer vision, mobile robotics, and computational neuroscience
fiendodto: hey i did :_
shieeeeeeeeet: @bichid69 don't mess up again
teayoflow: omg he bak
Apoplect1c: Alexey Ivakhnenko?
fiendodto: ::
bichid69: CHAIN RULE IS BASICALLY Y = G(F(X)), THEN DY/DX = DY/DG * DG/DX SO DGS "CANCEL" BRO
Aegrah: BRO
ellips0nspice: hey @georgehotz, what do you think about future development tools and nocode?
powerofpickle: BRO 1 + 1 = 2
thommy_exile: @georgehotz are you in a garage my man ?
Apoplect1c: but we told you
Apoplect1c: like 10 minutes ago
haizse: unlucky
TusKaN_BaNaNas: @Apoplect1c Yeah the controversy was partly around Yann Lecun and friends dont properly cite Alexey Ivakhnenko supposedly
senpagax: blocking chat has slowed learning rate but he'll get there eventually lol
powerofpickle: pretty sure sam harris invented ai
grekiki1234: mse is easier
Apoplect1c: @TusKaN_BaNaNas that's exactly how people get through school nowadays, rewrite rewrite rewrite
bichid69: CANT USE MSE FOR CLASSIFICATION BRO
grekiki1234: why not, one hot encoding
raisedbyphantom: long time no see geo
LoaexV2: Hello
ghhernandes: lol
bojandragic: he eatin doe
raisedbyphantom: he really made me search for these stupid chips
Aegrah: The funny thing is that this guy is actually right with all his comments bro KEKW
boy_milk: george is pretty cool but vitalik is cooler
raisedbyphantom: he is eating like it's delicious smh
carlosdanker: so right now we use torch.modules but try to remove them?
LoaexV2: are you in a basement?
senpagax: i want to see vitaliks full wardrobe
Bloodspark_: LUL
tubadota: @georgehotz the story about how you solved the Optimism solc compiler problem was epic
ein_echter_depp: dont you have a gf or a wife? how old are you? shouldnt you be spending time with your family instead of on twitch?
ellips0nspice: i waiting for a times when coding goes to the history, like writing a books. no one wants write books now. everyone plays fortnite
panpsychism_: lol, i literally built an MLP system for MNIST from scratch yesterday for school
panpsychism_: used sigmoid activation functions
shieeeeeeeeet: mathematic notation is still in the 19th century where people didn't have autocomplete IDEs to assist their thinking
carlosdanker: ein echter depp
failsonofbaconator: More people are writing books than ever before lol
panpsychism_: wild coincidence
ein_echter_depp: @carlosdanker yes?
ellips0nspice: gpt-3 write programs soon, what next?
carlosdanker: name checks out
ein_echter_depp: LOL
pyentropy: there should be a gist with derivatives of common activation and error functions
had3s_za: hi george, your videos have been very inspiring, thanks
atomichorse: Can somebody recap on what he is doing
gregzanchelli: building an mnist classifier from scratch
puji143: Hi buddy your streams are great
powerofpickle: he is coding and programming
teayoflow: nailed it
0xnan: hey George when will be published the episode with lex friedman?
0xnan: Fridman*
Vautry: this guy is hacking someone so hard right now
TusKaN_BaNaNas: gotta ask lex prob
gregzanchelli: @0xnan I think thats up to lex lol
bichid69: @0xnan can ppl stop asking that, he doesn't know
smurfd0: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40575841/numpy-calculate-the-derivative-of-the-softmax-function . that one and the last example had a link to a notebook for matrix
smurfd0: if you where doing calculations on matrxes
haizse: podcast probably this coming week or next week
caye237: Hellooo
ferdovvs: What are we doing today guys
ferdovvs: in 5 words
SHAVEYY_: wow
panpsychism_: mnist classifier from scratch
bankzed: bankzed subscribed at Tier 1. They've subscribed for 3 months! Love these streams, I hope this covers the spindrift and snacks.
bichid69: the biggest problem is gonna be that u have to do partial chain rule for every weight
ferdovvs: Thats awesome! Will you upload this to githuh? @georgehotz
ferdovvs: giothub*
ferdovvs: omg
panpsychism_: you got this
carlosdanker: lol
carlosdanker: we believe
fourier_transform__: what are you looking for?
Apoplect1c: Me? :)
boogieman002: is this code gonna be available somewhere so I can steal it?
bolleys: Whats good
bichid69: corona?
Kobayawaka: it's already in his github
Apoplect1c: Don't worry I am having my AI copy all of his work shown on the stream
bankzed: @bichid69 no, I think he drinks spindrift during strim
boogieman002: Thanks guys
fourier_transform__: @Apoplect1c no I was asking what was he trying to do I just tuned in
Apoplect1c: You have to reset 0 or make it local
Apoplect1c: I mean x
carlosdanker: mnist from scratch Kappa @fourier_transform__
Naasoupw: whats the time?
fourier_transform__: thought he was looking for how to derive with softmax
panpsychism_: ultimate goal is mnist classifier using only numpy library tho
ellips0nspice: future of digital wold is peoples like Geo. we will life in their codes, the matrix AI
panpsychism_: we will never upload consciousness
shieeeeeeeeet: @fourier_transform__ NN with numpy > optimize loss function using gradient descent > compute gradient of loss function using backprop > compute derivative of softmax
0xnan: george next project should be a little autodiff library:P karpathy has done a cool micro project about it...check his github https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd
Apoplect1c: reset x
powerofpickle: yeah I think andrew ng makes you do this in his ML class
fourier_transform__: dont forget to normalize your softmax output by subtracting the max of each example from each neuron or its gonna NaN
panpsychism_: most ML classes have an MNIST classifier assignment
panpsychism_: it's like the hello world of ML
fourier_transform__: and softmax derivative is simply prediction - target
panpsychism_: @georgehotz I thought you were doing it from scratch? (i.e. no libraries like pytorch)
ellips0nspice: @panpsychism_ never upload consciousnes, but AI codes everywhere and the codes controls everything
calcmath: i think he is using it to compare
carlosdanker: @panpsychism_ my guess is he's trying to remove them now
panpsychism_: @ellips0nspice fair enough. that's probably true
mannekchin: WHO IS THIS GUY? PogChamp
carlosdanker: replace with manual functions
panpsychism_: and okay that makes sense
carlosdanker: so basically we're demystifying NNs
SteveATZ: few years ago i liked your song on spotify and from time to time it comes up in shuffle, still like it xD
senpagax: deMNISTying NNs
panpsychism_: opening the black box as it were
carlosdanker: nice
panpsychism_: lol
angrywhopper: what's mnist
angrywhopper: il google lol
panpsychism_: handwritten digit dataset
haizse: does he use chromium?
panpsychism_: i think he uses googled chromium
angrywhopper: : )
SHAVEYY_: @haizse yes
meister1337: at least it stands there in the left corner
bankzed: the prefix de would imply he is taking out MNIST out of NN, tho? LuL
meister1337: :)
anirudhcheruvu2000: hello
ellips0nspice: @panpsychism_ yeah, cold codes control our lives, and codes made with devs who think their own things and no one understand what codes does. gpt-3 has closed source and developed by closed-things peoples like Geo
haizse: what is the benefit of using chromium?
teayoflow: @haizse no spyware
dyjabeu: no botnet
ellips0nspice: I thinke we are need better debug tools for understand AI better
fourier_transform__: chromium is open source I believe
haizse: oh i just use duckduckgo
carlosdanker: chromium or firefox bros?
miloeu: firefox
unf4mili4r: chromium
aadi_sam: @Firefox
unf4mili4r: firefox eats too much ram
PorkySoda: PorkySoda subscribed with Prime.
carlosdanker: @unf4mili4r yep
panpsychism_: i use chrome cause on firefox you can't set new tab page to a local html file
aadi_sam: What about stuff made with WebKit?
panpsychism_: and i use a custom new tab page i built myself
ellips0nspice: firefox was broken on my mac, linux and win some times ago. i moved to chrome/opera
ellips0nspice: something wrong with mozilla
ellips0nspice: mozilla fire vr team
haizse: i used brave on linux
teayoflow: brave, edge, chrome, are all build from chromium
carlosdanker: i suspect brave to mine my shit but can't prove it
powerofpickle: idk much about pytorch but you can probably just swap the np.arrays with tensors and get a speedup
Aegrah: any reasons why to use chromium over chrome besides its open source nature?
senpagax: lol edge, they just gave up making their own browser
haizse: cause regular google chrome is cringe
aadi_sam: @aegrah maybe memory efficiency
Keyeh: microsoft will rebase Windows to linux soon LUL
carlosdanker: ^ stonks
FargioFarmani: George, do you want to play a game of chess? @georgehotz https://lichess.org/RmJUg3LU
bankzed: samps or simps?
teayoflow: If yall understood what happens to your data...
miloeu: @unf4mili4r unused ram = wasted ram
unf4mili4r: hahah
powerofpickle: git checkout windows-nt && git rebase linux && git branch -d ms-dos
bankzed: that's like saying unused money is wasted money....
haizse: if you really cared about your data then you would not use the internet
miloeu: very much true for money aswell
aadi_sam: @miloeu is that Gary explains reference?
unf4mili4r: @miloeu wasted ram = missing ram for other programs
miloeu: never heard of them so probably not
powerofpickle: just dedotate more wam
lubashq: I mean it's ok to have unused RAM, as long as it doesn't permanently sit there doing nothing
unf4mili4r: true, might just need to download more ram
carlosdanker: ALL RAM WILL BE USED EVENTUALLY
teayoflow: people don't respect their own data, it's valuable
miloeu: every ram cell gotta be used otherwise they get lazy and fat
zangerxx: when will the interview with lex get published ?
powerofpickle: downloadmoreram.com
lubashq: @miloeu ram workout?
miloeu: yep
aadi_sam: @teayoflow it's valuable because of ads. we don't value ads so don't value our data either. lol
SHAVEYY_: @miloeu is that why memory leaks exist?
jjccccccj: did he get interviewed by lex again?
miloeu: @SHAVEYY_ no
SHAVEYY_: damn
aadi_sam: @jjccccccj no. This time he interviewed Lex.
haizse: ram will approach infinity
carlosdanker: lol
zangerxx: of
madmocro: Brother @georgehotz Can you take my calculus test this monday???
zangerxx: they did 2nd podcast
zangerxx: with lex
bankzed: btw, congratulations on 5 years with ,.ai
powerofpickle: Yeah should be in the next George Hotz podcast episode
madmocro: I'll gift a sub
teayoflow: Right now it's ads, but your browsing history, photos, habits, messages are being achieved
Zepcon7: What time is it where he is?
miloeu: is he in the office currently?
willarkitekt: Where is he?
Zepcon7: Nevermind its in Terminal
angrywhopper: 1:25 pm ?
hofergabriel: he went into the matrix
jjccccccj: jjccccccj subscribed with Prime.
willarkitekt: Netherlands ?
carlosdanker: @teayoflow guess what twitch's doing right now
teayoflow: do you trust a company to keep that data secure for the rest of your life?
willarkitekt: its like 01:10 in the matrics
aadi_sam: @teayoflow who cares man? doomers don't even care about life.
powerofpickle: George should move to Austin with Lex Elon and Rogan
haizse: texas is the place to be now
Keyeh: KKona
hofergabriel: why won't george do JRE?
RecklessInTx: KKona
jjccccccj: When is it going to be published? I started following Lex thanks to the George podcast

sliddjur: when should one use jupyther books ?
myaocat: @sliddjur if you want to feel how to work like academic but not really Kappa
aadi_sam: @sliddjur after being fed up with Jupyter books
tensorspac3: (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))

djceci: somebody knows if you can debug in jupyter?
djceci: like step into
djceci: and breakpoints
carlosdanker: in combo with vs code I think @djceci
tensorspac3: I mean, jupyter is kinda built that you can check every line
dt0v: Hey man! Big fan! keep it up!
Keyeh: imagine thinking a computer can learn LUL
carlosdanker: and break points you do every line
haizse: reject humanity embrace monke
bubblesnot: Welcome back to twitch George
djceci: yeah but is another thing debug line by line
Maatrice: how long will it take me to follow what he is doing, I know the basics of Python but Im learning more and more
tensorspac3: what kind of classifier is Goerge building
afterworktech: afterworktech subscribed at Tier 1.
KremBanan: wheres the vim
devoloution1: @tensorspac3 mnist
tensorspac3: log loss?
tensorspac3: mnist is the dataset no?
devoloution1: yes
Schrutt: herman miller... such expansive ergo chairs...
dadasikkk: @Maatrice, try to follow what he's doing, then try to do it by yourself
boneitis: buy a posture corrector and wear it when you bang out code
TheyTalkAboutMyWunTaps: @Maatrice It's not a question of time but experience, you'll still be able to follow most of this if you focus hard enough on the logic part rather than the syntax. I think it's safe to say that the more you code, the more this becomes sorta like a language you can follow through.
tensorspac3: @Maatrice he's not doing anything complicated language wise
Schrutt: @tensorspac3 right
painrikudolol: I am watching but can't understand anything he does
afterworktech: keep the hype train alive!
haizse: a lot of it is just math
bubblesnot: Are you back on twitch full time or YouTube?
Maatrice: Yeah language wise its okay I guess, I guess I should ask instead what he actually is doing
afterworktech: Choo Chooo HypeCherry
b0ngo: noise Pog
TheyTalkAboutMyWunTaps: @Maatrice It's sorta high level mathematics. It's alright if you actually can't follow this because most of us here neither do. It's more about the workflow and the approaches taken by him to solve the problem that's interesting.
TheyTalkAboutMyWunTaps: @Maatrice Again, it's all subjective.
1xelerate: George live? a surprise to be sure
Maatrice: Okay, thanks ;)
TheyTalkAboutMyWunTaps: @Maatrice You're welcome!
NicosPops: yo
TheyTalkAboutMyWunTaps: Yo NicosPops, welcome!
CitizenCinco: whats a good project for embedded NN?
brickeyy: monkaS
NicosPops: What's going on here in layman's terms?
frankmikael: what we coding?
Maatrice: He is coding our reality
CitizenCinco: @NicosPops it looks like he is making a neural netowrk
NicosPops: Thanks
ellips0nspice: training dev is easiest than gamedev now
alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxx: Mister george have you ever taken an iq test?
Honorwar: henlo
norflin221: his iq is higher then any test can test
frankmikael: This is mesmarizing, but i dont understand anything. is that wierd?
Maatrice: You're not alone
alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxx: @norflin221 doubt that
masters8: These comments LUL
norflin221: @alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxx what is your iq?
carlosdanker: did anyone here make good experiences with NN for stock/crypto trading?
CitizenCinco: @frankmikael not really. i dont understand much either. but to data scientist and ML engineers, id bet they say this is standard textbook material
leq1t3: this is going to be on youtube right?
alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxx: @norflin221 I've never taken a test
GooberFN: @alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxx his iq is 110, tested on stream
grekiki1234: testing what highlight does
fiendodto: george is 110?
frankmikael: Yeah, I'm sitting here like "he is hacking fed reserve"
Ziv0: LUL
haizse: i just ate 10 big macs
Maatrice: He should build a posture-reminder that zaps him every 3 minutes
fiendodto: why does it cost 7 million to send a message in sub mode
shanumbra: tf he is doing?
smurfd0: usually its posted to youtube a day or so later
devoloution1: PogChamp
alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxx: @GooberFN really? im gullible don't lie to me :(
tahiraslam8k: On which channel
St47ik: PogChamp
frankmikael: YES, we progress, right?
CitizenCinco: @shanumbra making a neural network but from scratch and not a popular framework most ppl use (tensorflow)
ellips0nspice: who is familiar with hn/reddit, i need a post about the new os?
kektobiologist: how was lunch? describe taste
fukurowlz: @shanumbra training an ia to make prediction based on dataframes
GooberFN: @alexxxxxxxxxxxxxxx No, not really. I have no clue lol. hes probably around 160 tbh
gooberguy6: what is ur optimizer like? SGD w/ momentum?
fiendodto: u know 160 is genius level right
norflin221: i have only 115
smurfd0: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwgKmJM4ZJQRJ-U5NjvR2dg
CitizenCinco: @gooberguy6 i think he said sgd
frankmikael: @georgehotz you usually code in python?
tahiraslam8k: @smurfd0 Thank you man
tahiraslam8k: @CitizenCinco depends on what he is doing
gooberguy6: I think the pytorch SGD has momentum builtin so that could be the diff
