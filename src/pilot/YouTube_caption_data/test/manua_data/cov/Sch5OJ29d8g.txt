So I'm happy to introduce
Olga Troyanskaya,
our first scientific keynote.
Olga went to college
at the University of Richmond.
She was in Russia until she was 16.
She went to the University of Richmond,
I remember.
So let me jump a little bit.
She then came to Stanford
and worked in my lab.
I'll get to that in a second.
But I remember very well her letters.
The people at the University of Richmond
were falling all over themselves about how
this young Russian girl at the time,
the young woman, just blew them all away.
And it was kind of, you know, one of these
great, easy decisions to accept her.
She came to Stanford
in biomedical informatics
and joined my lab.
We'll talk about that in a second.
Did her Ph.D and then, I believe,
went directly to a faculty position
at Princeton in Computer Science
and the Institute for Genomics
in the intervening 18 or so years.
She has also become
had an appointment
at the Simons Institute, and so she has
is both at Simons
and at Princeton, where she does
great work, some of which we will hear
about in a moment.
So my first memory of Ulga meeting her.
So of course, I remember reading
her application was at the a retreat.
We had a retreat in the fall and that's
where we met all the first year students.
And I don't know if she remembers this,
but we found ourselves
dancing the cha cha together.
She's a very good dancer.
And I don't remember who came up to who.
I'm really hoping it was the new student
coming to the faculty.
So that's what I'm going to go with
and said, let's dance the cha cha.
And so I remember thinking, Wow,
OK, here's a first year student,
and she's dancing the cha cha with
me, and she was very good.
She joined my lab.
She worked with also with David Botstein,
so she had two advisors, which is always,
of course, a pleasure for the student.
And David was in
the was a is a yeast geneticist
and an enthusiast
about informatics and computing,
and I was an actual informatics
and computer person.
And between the two of us, we basically
just watched Olga do her thing.
There wasn't a lot of advising,
there was a lot of watching.
And she did great work on Bayesian methods
for data integration
and at the time, looking at yeast protein
protein interactions.
But during that time, she did something
very valuable for both of us.
She wrote a paper about imputing
missing data in expression
data sets, and I have been aware of this
for many years.
This is my number one sided patient paper,
something like 4000 citations in Google,
and I just checked.
It's also your number one.
I said, Wouldn't it be cool
if it's my number one?
But it's not even her number one.
She has like 1,000,000 better.
But both of us have.
So we're we're linked
forever with this paper.
Data scientist information,
my number one paper is about
how to make up fake data, right?
That's the bottom line and that's
what imputation is, and my number one
contribution is how to trick
everybody and make up fake data.
Thank you very much for that citation.
She is the fourth Ph.D.
graduate from my lab, and I'm compulsive
enough that I keep track of this.
And so I have 34 graduates
and she was number four.
So it's with great pleasure
that we welcome Olga to PSB
and give her the traditional PSB lay.
And take it away, Olga, thank you.
Thank you so much for us, and thank you
to all the organizers for inviting me.
OK, great.
I'm sorry, I will keep my mask on,
although I have multiple people stationed
throughout the room to immediately
alert me
if it's not clear
so you two can alert me and I will adjust
, but it's really a great pleasure to be
here.
It's a great pleasure
to be here in person.
I don't know if I can beat Ross's
incredible introduction, but I'll try
and I'm going to talk today
about decoding the genome
to uncover
the molecular basis of human disease.
So really, I think for this audience,
I really don't have to sell this vision.
But I think
perhaps the most fundamental question
in biomedicine is really being able
to connect the genomes
to phenotypes, right,
including all of the environment,
et cetera.
So true molecular
understanding of human disease really
requires us to fully map
specific variants,
both within genes and outside genes
right to their biochemical
and then phenotypic effects
in the context of specific environment.
And we have to do it
through understanding their effects
on cell type and tissue
specific molecular circuits.
Now, if we can actually truly do that
right,
what we really hope to do is
that we would be able to live in a world
where our diagnosis, treatment
and even drug development
would be able to be done
through predictive models, right?
And eventually even mechanistic,
potentially
predictive models of human disease.
Now that would allow us to really study
both,
you know, look at personalized medicine
as well as actually study
fundamental biological processes
right from development
to evolution in this context, right?
So how do we get there?
How can we actually make this world
a reality?
And I think, you know, in this conference,
that's really what we're thinking about,
and this is my view of how we can go
essentially from the simplified
formula of data
model equals true predictive knowledge
in the context of
precision medicine
truly based on our personalized genomes.
And I think what we really need to do
to develop these predictive models is
we need to be able to look at molecular,
cellular and organismal systems, right?
So across scales,
and we need to be able to integrate
across these rebels of resolution
to really go all the way
from molecular biology and the genomes
all the way to organismal physiology.
I will not get there in this talk.
Hopefully, you you realize this,
but I do want to show you what I think
are the steps that we need to take
and give you some,
you know, really vignettes of projects
that my group has been working with,
together with incredible collaborators
from all over the U.S.
and the world in trying to address
every one of those steps.
And I think as a community,
many of you are working
at different points in this continuum,
and I'm really hoping that,
you know, in a decade
when we're here for PSB, oh gosh, 20.
31, is that right? 2032. There we go.
Perhaps we can actually start
really thinking about integrating across
these skills
in a true way in a predictive model.
So I think the first thing
that we really need to do
is we need to be able to predict
with high precision
affect of any variant in the genome,
be it in the genes
or regulatory variants
outside of the genes, right?
In a specific context.
And of course, we need to be able
to predict the biochemical level effects,
right, the epigenetic effects
and all the way to phenotypic effects.
Then we need to be able
to start modeling perturbations,
be that molecular perturbations, rates
or genetic perturbations,
environmental perturbations, right?
How would the effect of a particular drug
manifest itself in a particular cell
type in a particular genomic context?
We then
need to be able to integrate all of this
information and models
that cross the various scales, right,
so we might have an amazing model
for particular cell type.
But can we transfer this information?
Let's say if it's, you know, proximal
epithelial tubular sense of the kidney,
can we then understand what it means
for the entire kidney?
In a particular
environmental context again,
and then finally, we really need
to be able to integrate all of these
different measurements and scale,
so dynamic snapshot data, etc.
and really predict
have unified predictive models.
So I want to give you some vignettes
of how we're thinking about this in
the first one is really just this
fundamental ability to decode the genomes.
So far, the vast
majority of disease
genetics has really focused on genes.
So here I am showing it as these
four exons the tip of the iceberg, right?
And so there's a reason for this, right,
both in terms of that
that's easier to study, but
also those mutations do tend to be by far
the more powerful in terms of their impact
on directly on the phenotype.
But in reality, this
is a much more complex picture, right?
So protein coding genes
account for less than 2% of the genome,
and the rest of the 98%
are in a large part
responsible for regulation,
both transcriptional regulation regulating
when those genes are expressed
and pulls transcriptional regulation.
Right.
So for example, RNA splicing,
transport stability, et cetera, right?
So there's an incredibly nice.
This is not news
for any of you, obviously,
but I really want to emphasize 98%, right,
that we've been largely ignoring
because it is really hard to study.
And so the reason
that it's so hard to study
is that the search space here
is just incredibly vast, right?
As computational people.
This is not surprising to us,
and I know some of you
in the audience work
exactly on these problems.
We're talking about
98% of 3 billion letters.
And of course, this combinatorial issues,
right?
And some of these variants
have manifest only in a particular genomic
background, et cetera.
So what we need is to be able
to have an equivalent
of the genetic code that we have
that tells us in any molecular biology
of the cell molecular biology
or genetics textbook,
it tells us how do variants affect
the encoding for amino acids, right?
We need the
equivalent of that
for the regulatory code, basically.
And this is not easy, the key challenge
that is that
even if all of these individuals
have the same exact disease,
the underlying variants
that may predispose them for this disease
might be completely different.
And again, we're in the search space of
90% of the 3 billion letters,
and it might be
a combination of those variants
that's actually causing different effects.
So essentially, our supervised
the traditional statistical approaches
are going to fail,
even if we deeply sequence
and deeply phenotype whole populations.
Right.
I would have an hour to almost
see if we sequence and deeply phenotype.
The whole world.
We're still no not going to get
with statistical significance
every single rarer variant,
because some of them also might be
embryonic
lethal in the vast majority of context.
But pop up in
just the right genomic context and still
have effects on a disease.
So what we
need is essentially this regulatory
code, right, where in the coding variant
we know we can look up and this
pretty little map what the effect will be
of switching this g for an A or T.
And you know, of course,
I'm slightly oversimplifying.
There's a huge and very interesting
question of studying missense mutation
for the vast majority of these mutations,
we do have at least some understanding
of what it would affect.
And there is other programs and approaches
that are have been really powerful
in looking at, for example,
how a particular mutation
affects the three dimensional structure
of proteins, et cetera.
In fact, I've learned about some of them
in my day at Brussels Group.
But we need something where we can take
any non-coding variant, right?
Even one that has never been encountered
in any study
and be able to predict how it would affect
the epigenetic structure.
Right. So and then expression, right?
We want to be able to say this
and to see change in this location
on the genome in the middle of nowhere
on chromosome seven
is going to reduce expression
of this protein.
Right?
And then we want to be able
to have Athena Typekit prediction.
And it is actually going
to be not just functional
in that it affects this protein,
but it also is pathogenic
because some of these variants
would be completely nonfunctional, right?
You can change this T,
and it will have zero effect to anything.
Some of them might actually change binding
on a particular transcription factor,
but be benign, right?
Maybe, you know, effects means that
I have curly hair but has straight hair,
but others you don't have straight hair
you have.
OK, doesn't have hair. All right.
But, you
know, others might actually predict
that we have higher predisposition.
Paul Summers,
and that's what we need to be able to do.
And it turns out that deep learners
machine learning with deep learning
is actually quite powerful
for this specific problem.
So deep learners
can actually accurately predict
impact of these regulatory variants,
both of the transcriptional level.
So I'll tell you a little bit more
about our specific program,
which is called the deep sea
and at the post transcriptional level.
So in our case, it's
the Sikh weaver method
that can predict effects of variance for,
you know, anything from splicing
to RNA stability in critically.
These models do not need
to learn on any mutational data.
So I know I'm over emphasizing this,
but this is really critical in that
we need to be able to predict any variant
with single nucleotide resolution.
And as soon as you start learning on
mutational data, you're basically learning
only common variants that you actually
can find enough times in your cohort.
So just to
give you an intuition of how this works,
so we use convolutional neural networks.
There's actually other approaches
like Transformers that may actually become
even more powerful for this.
But I'll tell you,
the intuition is very similar.
Right.
So the first point why CNN's are useful
is the hierarchical structure, right?
The hierarchical structure of science
allows us to capture
the context information on DNA. Right.
So the learner slides along the genome.
We don't use
any variant information to learn.
So we use just one genome.
We use the reference genome.
But honestly,
you can use any human genome.
And then we use a large number
of regulatory sequences.
So basically cheap seek databases, right?
So transcription
factor information, histone marks
and DNA hypersensitivity information.
And of course, what's really important
is that genome doesn't
actually match
any of those experiments, right?
And the experiments could be tissue
and cell type specific.
So you can actually learn these models in
a tissue and cell type specific context.
But it's well,
it's actually philosophically interesting.
It's an unsupervised approach
with respect to variance.
But you can argue that it's somewhat
supervised along the genome.
So the model slides along the genome,
right?
And it's seen what is really allowing
you to learn is that as it's sliding along
the genome, it's seen many examples
of that transcription factor binding site
or what sequence is really telling it
to have a particular histone mark.
Right.
So even though the genome doesn't
match any of the functional readouts
that you have?
Along, you know, when you see enough
examples of those learners
are able to capture what in the sequence
is actually underlying those features.
And of course, for that,
the hierarchical structure
is very important
because as we know in DNA,
the context is quite important
how these features are related
next to each other.
Of course, that brings us to the
interaction of sequence features, right?
We know that some transcription factor
binding information is going to be in
how the histone marks
are arranged around that area.
Right.
And that's the sort of information
that this model is learning.
In fact,
it would be great to dig under the hood
and figure out what exactly learned,
because it's really learning the biology
and the signaling beyond what we can often
know from our knowledge of regulatory,
epigenetics and genetics.
And finally,
we set this up as a multiplex prediction.
So really, the output layer shares
all the inputs.
So we get even more power
because of course, for some cell types
and tissues, we have a lot more data.
And for others, we have less.
And therefore the model is able
to use the information
for those tissues and cell types
for which there is a lot of information
to improve its predictions
if it's relevant, of course, for the
rarer cell types and tissues.
So it turns out this actually works
quite well.
I'm very happy if you guys have questions
to show your graphs
and tell you why we think it works
quite well.
I will just show you it's been very widely
used by many studies.
My very favorite of everything,
just from phylogenetic polygenic disease
risk to cancer, I think somewhere.
Blood pressure.
My favorite one is this eyebrow
thickness study.
I hope, you know,
I do actually find this kind of fun.
But in any case, Alzheimer's, et cetera.
And, you know, as you can see,
there are quite widely used
in what we're actually pushing
now on the technological front
is really being able to both make this,
you know, hierarchical architecture
development, both make it more systematic
and also more,
you know, really democratic.
So right now,
the way that architecture is developed
is basically somebody like my graduate
student to one of your postdocs
essentially comes up with the parameters
and then we run optimizations
and we try to make the parameters
perform better.
And eventually you end up in the model
and you decide, you know, exactly
what the model might look like.
So Frank Zhang,
who is actually on the market,
who is really an amazing postdoc
in my group,
he actually has developed an approach
called AMBER for automatic design
of these neural network architecture.
So he optimized the neural network
architecture search approach for biology.
And it turns out that actually
the architectures that Amber can learn
are as accurate or more accurate than
the ones that are human expert designed.
But, of course, more systematically
designed automatically by the system
and actually quite fast as well.
So you can see, for example, how much you
can search in a reasonably fast approach.
So I won't get into
too much on where it is published,
but I just wanted to
tell you that it's out there.
So what I
do want to tell you about is,
so how can we use it?
So what we were really interested in doing
is now that hopefully have convinced you
that this is valuable and can be accurate.
And of course, there is now
a huge number of deep learning approaches
for these problems.
Can we actually use it to study a hard,
challenging disease question that hasn't
been able to be answered before?
And indeed,
so one of the large open questions
was the role of
if there is a role of non-coding
de novo non-coding regulatory variants
actually in any complex human disease.
So that was a huge open question.
And by de novo non-coding regulatory
variants, I mean, variants that are not,
you know, not affecting your genes
but affecting the regulation, right?
So transcriptional, both transcriptional
and de novo
just means that it's genetic,
but your parents don't have them, right?
So it's something that it's not inherited.
It's something that you have in your DNA,
but your parents didn't.
And it was a huge, you know,
there were a lot of signs
that the regulatory variants might affect
things in complex human disease.
But really,
there was none of the approaches
that people have tried to prove
that this was happening.
We're working, and the way you actually
prove it in quantitative genetics
is that you literally
look at patients with the disease.
You sequence them, you look at patients
without the disease, you sequence them,
you control as much as possible.
I mean, ideally twin studies,
we have siblings,
but you know, even just patients.
And then you want to say, Well,
I have a significant enrichment
of the variants of the type
that I'm trying to associate with disease
in my disease
individuals versus my controls.
And that's precisely
what people were trying to do in autism,
I mean, or in a number of complex
human diseases, and they couldn't find
enough of a statistical significance
because of course, again,
3 billion letters
or 98% of the revealing is huge search
the basis of very hard
to get statistical significance.
And autism is, of course,
an important disease in and of itself.
It's highly prevalent,
but it's also a case study
for whether this could be proven anywhere.
And in fact,
right before our paper actually came out,
there was a paper that came out in signs
on the same exact cohort
that I'll show you in a second
looking at these, this exact setup.
And in fact, they were smarter than that.
They actually said, Well,
what if we just didn't?
Don't just look at all the variants
that are regulatory, but we overlap.
For example, seek
information will only take the variants
that are inside sneak peeks,
or we only take variants
that are close to known autism genes
or will only take variants
that are in promoters
or will only take variants
that are close to conserved genes
that are more likely to be disease.
So that's what each of those dots is.
You can see that
this is if you look at all the variants,
these all these dots are all the many ways
that they've tried to select
functional variants, and not a single
one of them gets even close to
significance.
Once you control
for multiple hypothesis testing.
And so what we wanted to do
is flip this on its side and say, well,
we have these models,
we have deep sea and seek weaver.
And they don't do anything about autism,
but they know how to predict
which variants are likely to be functional
and disease associated.
Right?
So what if we just see,
instead of counting
how many variants a child
with autism has versus in this case,
this is a very well-controlled cohort.
It's a what's called a quack design.
So we have four bands
the kids with autism,
and we have whole genome sequencing
also for their unaffected siblings
and for the father and the mother.
So we can actually control and say,
Well, is there not just an enrichment
in the number of variants in the pro band
versus the sibling ?
And it turns out
there is no significant enrichment.
So the red bars, how many on average,
the regulatory mutations
we see in the children with autism
and red versus their unaffected siblings
in green,
you can see it's basically the same.
There's no significant difference.
But what if the kids with autism,
their mutations are worse, right?
They're more disruptive.
And since I'm talking about it,
you can probably tell
what the answer is going to
be. So it turns out indeed,
at or even the whole genome level, right?
Without subsiding to anything,
we see a significant difference
in how disruptive the regulatory
variants are predicted to be by our deep
learners, both at the scriptural level
and same thing as both transcriptional.
And you see that this difference actually
is just a significant.
But the difference does increase
quantitatively as you look at genes
that are more likely to be disease,
you know, variants close to genes
that are more likely to be disease
associated.
So loss of function and tolerance,
as well as genes that are
have either a known link
or a predicted link to autism.
So this was the first proof
that indeed noncoding de novo variance,
regulatory variance are
in fact playing a causal role in complex
human disease, in this case in autism.
And since then, we actually have done this
in collaboration with others
looking at congenital heart disease,
and we're working on this and cancer
and the congenital heart disease.
We saw basically the same story
that indeed regulatory variants
do have a significant impact in.
Oops!
There we go.
And we actually have experimentally shown
that a number of these variants
with high predicted impact do indeed
impact do indeed drive expression
and a differential way
between the l'oeil for the sibling versus
the Probyn.
So this is, you know, here we're actually,
of course, this is in tissue culture.
This is not in humans, right?
But this is looking at the dizzy value,
you know, the single letter change
between the autism child child with autism
and their unaffected sibling.
And just watching that one
single nucleotide
causes differential expression
in this particular essay.
And in fact, 94% of the variance
that we tested
did show us this significant difference.
So these would be very interesting
candidates for future studies, perhaps
in mouse, et cetera.
Now on the
transcript, this was,
of course, transcripts
on the pulse transcriptional level,
our collaborator Bob Darnell's group,
but Rockefeller actually looked
at specifically
and is deep
broadband specific variant in SMAC one.
So smack one is a very important Syrian
three kinase
that's highly conserved,
so clearly is important
has never before the study
been associated with autism in any way.
We found that indeed, as predicted
by SIG, we were thus.
Particular variant would cause an as deep
been so autism specific reduction
in the long isoform of smack one.
And that's, you know,
you can see this in the genes,
but you also can see this in the bar
graph.
What's perhaps even more important is here
we can actually connect things
all the way to phenotype.
I'll just be completely honest,
it's very hard to take things
all the way to phenotype
a because regulatory variants,
each separate variant actually,
of course, has less of an impact
on both epigenetics and phenotype.
It's good for us because we all carry
a lot of variants around
that are regulatory right again,
98% of 3 billion letters.
So we don't want them
to be highly impactful.
But as a group, we actually have shown,
you know, with some assumptions,
we can show that the impact of these
regulatory variants is actually quite
comparable
to the impact of de novo coding variants,
and they're actually at the post
transcriptional level
in the next study
that I'll tell you about.
In fact, we show that there are even
at least in mental health diseases
there actually even higher impact
than the coding variants
for inherited variants there.
But here we can actually take it
all the way to phenotype.
There's
actually enough of a statistical power
in that we found that low band IQ,
so low IQ,
specifically in autistic
kids, is significantly associated
with high impact of dysregulation.
At this post, transcriptional regulatory
level might support just the kids
if they have a higher rate of hits
at the post transcriptional level,
like this variant,
that is a significant association
with their IQ.
So that takes us to the next level, right?
So we've talked about decoding of genomes,
but can we actually think further going
all the way from these genomic impacts
to thinking about them as perturbations?
And I'm going to really go a little bit
more deeply into the dysregulation
of the target site level
for any binding proteins?
So so far, I've just talked about post
transcriptional impact
and waved my hands at it.
But what I actually really mean
is thinking about RNA binding proteins,
which unless you study RNA,
you might not have thought
about very deeply,
but they're incredibly important.
They regulate every aspect of our name
metabolism.
So splicing transport stability,
anything right?
Of course, they're even going
to be extremely important in the brain
where you, as you can imagine,
just because of the structure
of neurons as cells, for example,
transport is incredibly important.
If you need to get something to the axon.
So our
BP is regulate all of our metabolism,
and they've been previously associated
very strongly with many different mental
health diseases at the level of variants
that impact the actual
RNA binding protein, right?
So variants that hit upon our body,
for example, as one famous one
you might have heard about
are involved in intellectual disability.
They've been associated with autism,
et cetera.
What I'm talking about is not that right.
So that means that you can have a hit
on one of those RNA binding proteins
through hundred nucleotides, et cetera.
But of course,
there's the entire rest of the genome.
And what?
You could actually have a target site,
so you might actually have a perfectly
functional RNA binding protein,
but you might have mutations in where it's
supposed to bind
right at the target sites.
And so now you're perfectly functional.
I'll just use it from Part
B, as the example
is no longer going to bind there.
So add
those regulatory variants also important,
and that's the question
that we want to ask.
So we have those non-coding variants.
Can we estimate
how are they going to affect
the ability of our NI binding protein
to bind and regulate that Armani?
And then is that associated
with a psychiatric disorder?
And this is
work of Chris Burke,
who is really an incredible scientist
in my group and really conceived
this entire project and led it.
And again, in collaboration with Bob Daw,
now at Rockefeller.
So what Chris is doing is
he is going to use his sick river
model, right, that's specific.
So he has a number of models.
200 some models, each of them trained
for particular RNA binding protein.
Right.
So these are deep learners
like I just showed you trained
for both transcriptional effect
prediction.
Each model
a specific warning by the trained on
in vivo data these clip essays,
which actually is important.
So what he is going to do
is he is going to take, you know,
the original oleo from the reference
genome versus the mutational deal.
And now we're going
to look at hereditary mutations.
So we're looking at givas data, right?
And for each of those snips,
we're going to predict the probability
of RNA of the RNA binding protein
binding to the reference
illegal versus alternative ilil.
And the difference between
these two basically gives us the estimate
of how disruptive that variant is.
Right.
So it's actually once you have the deep
learning, it's actually a pretty simple
calculation.
And of course,
then all you have to do is
figure out if there's a significant
statistical association
between the pathogenic impact
that's just coming
from the given studies directly right.
And the estimated are BP dysregulation,
which is coming from the deep learner.
And so in this, this is exactly
what we're looking at, right?
So just focus on one graph
we're looking at on the x axis
is the pathogenic impact
coming directly from G ones.
We're looking at a psychiatric disorder,
consortia, drugs.
So there's five diseases added
ADHD, autism, bipolar, major
depression, schizophrenia
and on the y axis
is the estimated impact
of dysregulation from the deep learner.
And what we're looking for is for each
dot, here is one of those models
the one RB P.
So we're looking other any dots above the
false discovery rate of point 05.
And the first thing that you can see
is that for every one of those diseases,
they're actually quite a few dots.
So quite a number of our piece
have a significant association
between dysregulation of those are
BP functions at the level of target site
dysregulation, right?
So again, the proteins are totally fine,
but they just can't bind
where they're supposed to
and psychiatric disorder risk.
And what was actually,
I have to say, Chris.
So Chris trained for his postdoc with Bob
Darnell and even did all of these clips,
which are incredibly painful experiments
to like really hard experiments to do so .
He, you know, I asked him afterwards.
I was blown away by this particular fact
that when he compares this,
I don't have the graph in the talk.
But when he actually compares
the extent of this impact,
what the regulatory level,
to the extent of all the coding variance.
It's significantly larger
than non-coding, in fact,
than the coding variance in this case.
And I told him I was like,
Chris, this is incredible.
Like, do you agree?
Like, were you surprised?
And he was like,
No, I kind of expected it.
So I guess people in the RNA world
actually aren't that surprised,
but I think this is really pointing out
that we really need to be looking at both.
Coding doesn't
mean we shouldn't be looking at coding.
We just need to be looking at coding
and regulatory variance if we really want
to interpret heritability
and impact of genetics and human disease.
And you know, the second point, of course,
is you can see how broad this is.
This is across all of these different
diseases, mental health diseases.
The next sort
of question that I think you probably
are thinking about, or at least
I really thought was critical is that
brings us to a question of two worlds.
So hopefully have convinced you
of regulatory variants are important.
But the next fundamental questions,
if they're important.
We have two worlds in one world,
they're important,
but they impact different pathways
in a different way than coding variants.
And then in my very official capacity,
I will tell you we're kind of screwed
right because we need to develop totally
different treatment options, right?
Like we really need
to figure this out from scratch.
I mean, we could do it, but
it would be really hard world to live in.
Or there's another world which is
still hard, but a lot better for us.
And that's the world
where those regulatory variants
are affecting the same types of pathways
as the coding variants,
so the risk is converged.
And I think a priori, we don't know.
So I still don't know hardcore
what the answer is generally.
But I can tell you that we've looked
at this in the context of autism,
and we've looked
at this in the context of this study
across mental health disorders.
And so far, it's very encouraging.
In both cases,
we do see the convergence of risk.
And so I'll show you actually examples.
So for example, here is one
RNA binding protein étudie to.
And indeed, you know, this is
showing that this model is significantly
associated with pathogenic dysregulation
in this target, sites of this protein
are significantly associated
with pathogenic risk for inherited
variants and ADHD, bipolar
and schizophrenia.
And in fact, if you look actually
at the protein sequence,
there's a huge number of documented
mutations affecting the coding
region of the protein that are linking
an outlook.
Boards are here
that are linking it all the way
to a number of developmental
and intellectual disorders.
And we see this.
I'm just showing you one example, but
we see this for large number of proteins.
And in the autism case, we actually have
a quantitative proof is too strong
of a world, a quantitative demonstration
of this being significant.
So I'm very hopeful
that while it's not going to be easy
figuring out both the coding
and the regulatory risk and of course,
then integrating all of these together
in the specific
genomic and environmental context,
at least it's very likely
that the risk is going to have a effect
on the same pathways
or at least similar pathways.
So that will make it a lot easier
in terms of both figuring out what's going
on, understanding
how it affects cell type and tissue
specific and organ physiological networks,
and also hopefully developing drugs
and being able to repurpose drugs.
So next, I really want you to
think about thinking across time
and scale, right?
So of course, all of this isn't happening
and it's, you know,
separately just in the genome
at this molecular level.
All of this is happening
in the longitudinal context
that's happening across scales of having
that genetic impact is going all the way
to the physiological and clinical impact.
And that brings me to a story
that I've,
sadly is still very relevant to us.
I was kind of hoping by now
it would be less relevant,
but it is still very relevant
and that's COVID 19.
So my lab in the past,
as probably many of you in the past
couple of years has focused on a lot
on looking at the COVID data.
And one of the questions
we've been very interested in looking at,
together with a wonderful collaborator
we have at Mount Sinai, is towards cell
phone and a huge group
on this
project is understanding
sex differences in COVID 19.
So, you know, this is very, actually very,
it turns out very timely.
Quite recently,
there was another article on this.
And you've probably heard that
men are a much higher risk of adverse
outcomes for COVID 19 if you haven't.
Now you have.
But it is.
It's a very well documented fact.
I have not discovered it right.
What is complicated
is there's a huge number of hypotheses,
and the hypotheses are based on
a lot of right like so women do have
somewhat different immune response
to infection in general
and during COVID.
one big hypothesis is androgens, right?
Like,
I mean, there's even a doctor in Brazil
that that probably
I mean, the androgen is actually
a very reasonable hypothesis
that the doctor in Brazil is, you know,
I wouldn't follow, but you know
who was trying to prescribe patients
and treating patients with prostate
cancer medications for COVID.
There's all sorts of you know,
then there's like the obvious hypothesis
of maybe it's just a side effect
that men have higher rates
of cardiovascular disease in general,
like die earlier.
So maybe it's just that it's very hard
to control for when you have aging
severe COVID cases.
So all sorts of things.
And we wanted to study this and we have
this really pretty amazing cohort.
So what we're studying
is a group of marines
that are training the training
to become marines on Parris Island.
So this is thousands of marines
basically in this, it's as controlled.
I mean, I I like to say it's
pretty much a controlled environment
as you get with human large scale
human studies.
There are literally on this island.
There's nothing else on this island
but their training ground.
They're completely controlled, right?
They're all in the same way training.
There's very strict COVID protocols.
They're PCR tested weekly
and the ones who volunteer
for our studies also,
we have their blood weekly
so we can look at the molecular level
of RNA and protein with all link.
And we have
a pretty large group
that we have this information for.
So that means that we know exactly
when they test positive for COVID
and we can track them right
and we know which RNA.
So we have longitudinal RNA dahlia
matching their pre
infection during and post infection.
So I'm not going to use the post infection
in this particular story,
but it does give us this very controlled
cohort with molecular measurements.
And of course, they also have
clinical information across all of this.
Both self-reported symptoms,
as well as nurse measure temperature.
So we have a very controlled measure
as well,
and we have a pretty large numbers.
Of course, it is sex biased rate.
There's a lot more males,
but still we have 3000 males
and about 3300 females.
The even prior to on
the corner was pretty depressing
the rate at which they were infected.
So about a third of the males
and more than half of the females
had gotten infected
in the time that we looked at the study.
And so we have plenty of data
that we can look at,
and the question that we want to ask is,
can we find molecular predictors
prior to the infection
that could tell us what is happening?
And this cohort is actually pretty unique.
In addition to longitudinal part in that,
they're very controlled, right?
These guys are all fit.
They're all pretty much the same age
or the same age group.
They all get non-severe.
I'm an extremely mild COVID No.
one and landed in the hospital.
So this is young adult,
very well controlled cohort.
So it takes out a lot of these cool
variants that we're worried about in
our typical population.
And the first thing that we actually see
is that on the systematic level, white
females have higher rates
of every single symptom significantly,
and it's not just that they complain too
much, it's really like, you know, the the
that's I mean, all the guys immediately
my husband's
first hypothesis anyway.
But you know, they
if you look at the temperature,
which is nurse measured,
we see the same thing.
It's quite clearly real.
But what we see is that there are viral
loads are lower.
And this might be confusing,
but city value, if you haven't looked at
this data is inversely proportional
to viral load rate.
So higher KTI significantly higher city
and women mean significantly lower volume.
So they have less virus in them,
but higher symptoms for the clinicians.
Probably this is
starting to make sense. And
what we do see is
the specific pathway
that we're really started immediately
focusing on is that the females show
stronger molecular response to infection,
so they have higher interferon
stimulated genes.
Iodine is significantly higher level
than males.
And again, this is consistent
with looked very carefully.
We actually have sequences of the viruses
that they're infected with.
So we actually did look also at the fact
whether this is just different strains
and there is no bias for the strains
and sort of all the obvious things, right?
And we also find some sex specific immune
splicing regulation
as well between men and women.
So it does seem that during infection
and prior to infection, this is important.
The women actually have the stronger
ESG levels and response.
So since we have this longitudinal data
encompassing
pre and during infection samples,
we can actually use causal mediation
to understand
whether there are pre infection
sex differences
that might actually be explaining
these clinical, molecular and clinical
outcomes that we see during infection,
and indeed we do see that.
So we actually see that
there's significant differences
between IIS specific types of boys genes
that are present in women
during infection.
There are significantly explaining
what's happening at the molecular level
during infection.
Did I say this
month, sorry, prior to infection
that will explain what is happening
during infection
and that's linked to the symptoms
throughout infection?
I should say specifically
to the viral load,
what's happening,
what we think is happening
just for full disclosure, this
so this is all statistically significant.
This is borderline significant,
but we think what's happening
with viral load and that is consistent.
What is seen in the past during infection
and other diseases is that women,
basically because they are sort of
immune systems, are pretty hyped up.
They were just able to clear the virus
faster, right?
So that causes more severe symptoms,
but lower viral load.
Right. And that's actually consistent.
But the key thing is that prior
to the study, there was no way to link
the pre infection.
What's happening
pre to what's happening during infection?
And the important part
is, of course, is this something
that's just specific
to this young adult population?
And it turns out we can actually just
look at these same ideas in other studies
right before COVID
and look at what's happening in studies
not related to infection, just,
you know, different cohorts
where there's expression data
for older, more diverse populations.
And we actually replicated in two other
very large scale studies prior to COVID,
not related to any infections that women
do have a significantly higher expression
level of these ages than men do.
Even for this general population,
that's not young or fit.
So that's been really interesting,
and that's really allowed us to
like be able to have this cohort
that's really longitudinal
has really enabled us
to look at the molecular level
and at the level of really being able
to have some causality
of what is happening
pre infection to predict the outcome.
And finally, of course, how am I doing?
Oh, good, perfect.
All right, so finally, I want to really
think about how we can,
you know, we're in from a distance.
So I'm telling you all these stories
and of course, those methods.
But I sort of do want to include my,
I guess,
a little bit of a philosophical note.
So I'm a big believer
that the world has changed, right?
It used to be at least, you know, Russell
said that my advisor was David Boston.
He's like one of the greats of genetics.
And so, you know, you would have
your new study, you would go to David
and you sort of use David
as one big encyclopedia of right.
And David would have some opinion
based on 17 papers
that he's read throughout his life.
And you know, who knows what else?
And you know, you would go to your most
the smartest colleague or like,
biggest, you know, biologist,
and then they would figure it out, right?
I think the world has changed.
It's not just about how much we know,
it's really
about how much the data knows, right?
Because there's so much information
that's in the public data
that we haven't
actually written a paper about, right?
That is not obvious
from even the best analysis
until you look across
a huge number of datasets.
So I think it used to be that every study
we had to put in the context
of prior literature,
I think now we really need
to put every new analysis
in the context of prior data.
Right.
And so that we've been thinking about
that a lot and we really
try to use
these functional networks
as one of the ways to be able
to put every new analysis
in the context of this prior data.
So we basically have been
thinking a lot of how can we take a huge
number of thousands of,
you know, basically every gene
expression dataset ever published,
as well as physical interaction data,
you know, other, you know, basically
the kitchen sink, anything that tells us
when proteins are expressed, how
they're regulated, how they're interacting
and build tissue
and cell type specific circuits.
And in this case,
they're not mechanistically results.
So they're not trying to be pathways
right there.
You know, for us computational people,
they're fully connected weighted graphs
that really just represent
the functional context specific.
So in this case, tissue and cell type.
But you can imagine context being disease
or context being developmental stage
or context being a particular condition.
Summary of the entirety of data.
And now you can actually interpret
every new study in the context of what's
sitting there.
So the way that we do this is,
as Russ mentioned,
we still use Bayesian approaches.
Although I think that it doesn't have to
be Bayesian, it is just what has worked
well for us.
It's a semi supervised,
regular regular is Bayesian classifier.
What we do is, you know,
we have these thousands of this is,
of course, picture of microarrays.
So probably from those of you,
you don't even know what this is.
But you know our Nasik pretend
like it's RNA seq.
I just have a I like the picture.
It's pretty funny
when we're talking with the students
and they're like, Oh, what is this anyway?
And you know, we have physical interaction
data, transcription factor
by sites, et cetera.
What we need to do is
we need to be able to identify
how useful is each of those datasets
to a particular question.
So if you're trying to study, let's say
I'm going to soon talk about
a particular cell type in the brain
or a particular cell type in the kidney.
There are some data sets
in this collection
that are incredibly useful
for that information, right?
They might not actually be coming
from that cell type, right?
For example, kidneys and neurons
actually have some of the same pathways.
Certain types of cells in the kidneys
have same pathways activated, right?
Some data on this collection
are just garbage.
They're not going to be useful
for anything.
And then some of them are amazing
data sets,
but they're completely irrelevant to that
particular kidney cell type, for example.
So what you need to do, what we're using
these Bayesian classifiers
for is to essentially weigh
each of the data sets
based on how relevant and accurate
it is for that particular cell type.
And so
the way it weighs, that is
by looking at the evidence
in a given dataset and using a gold
standard of what we really want
is cell type specific interactions, right?
So we want which two proteins,
which parts of a canonical pathway
like, let's say, a clinic is regulating
its target are actually happening
in the particular cell type,
your study that doesn't quite exist.
So we use
what I think is the next best thing.
We overlay cell type or tissue
specific expression in that,
let's say cell type two, the pathway.
And we make an assumption
that if both the kinase and its target
are expressed in that cell type,
and we know that that's the target
of that kinase,
probably that relationship is happening.
Most of such relationships
are happening in that cell type.
So that's the goal things, right?
Like the positives and then the negatives
are really just unrelated genes.
So, you know, obviously we don't.
Negatives are famously not studied
in biology and not published in biology.
So again, next best thing we take.
Shares of genes
that have been studied for something else
but have never been found together, right,
so either that kinase is not
and not its target rate
or it is a kind in its target,
but they're not expressed in that tissue.
one of them is expressed
that the one isn't right.
You see where.
And so the data set that's informative
for that cell type will be the one
where those two distributions
are very far from each other.
And if those two distributions
fully overlap,
that that data set is useless
for that particular question.
Right.
And so that means that when you are trying
to identify probabilities,
so that gives you a weight.
Right.
So basically, it's the same way
we should really ideally do elections
in this country, right?
Like you only get to vote proportionately
to how good you are at understanding
that. Yeah, that's never going to work.
But you know, in this case,
we are doing. Yes.
five. Perfect.
So we're going to
get each of those weights
and then we're going to get a probability
for every pair of jeans i
j for the entire genome, right?
Every possible pair, we're going
to integrate all of the information.
Let's say how these genes are correlated,
how whether they're physically interacting
in some study weighted
by the weight of,
you know, the confidence value, the
the weight that the dataset
got from this process.
And so, you know, then
there is a semi supervised version of this
that actually allows you to do
even better by using predicted
probabilities of interactions
in this process,
but I'm not going to go into it
unless you guys want to.
And furthermore,
we can do this across different organisms.
And so then you can actually use
these networks also to transfer knowledge
in a fully molecularly based,
data driven way, not just a
semantic way across organism.
All right, so
does this work, we've evaluated
this computationally, experimentally
out of the wazoo, across
different organisms.
I'll just show you one example
where we're looked at Ironman
beta, which is a very important cytokine.
Our collaborators were interested
in looking
specifically at cardiovascular disease,
so we looked specifically at blood vessel
networks, right?
So this is top 20 interactions
of all one beta predicted by this network.
The network knows nothing
about cardiovascular disease, right?
It's trained
purely on this giant collection of data
without knowing what
the labels for each dataset are anything.
And it turns out
when our collaborators tested this,
so at the first time point
for simulated stimulation of Ironman beta
18 out of 20 of these network
neighbors are significantly upregulated,
and in fact, the other two
are actually known into vectors,
but just not transcriptional control.
So we are predicting things correctly,
but perhaps more importantly,
we're predicting this
in a lineage specific manner.
So actually, if you look at our predicted
networks that are not so blood vessel
network is by far the most specific
and accurate for this test .
When you look at our other
cardiovascular system related celltex
and tissues, there are sort of the next
most accurate group.
And then if you look at the global network
or tissues that are not related
to cardiovascular system, they're not even
close to the accuracy of these, right?
Like so same exact data.
The only thing we're changing
is these gold standards
that I told you about,
and you can get very different networks.
And just very briefly
way that we can use these rights,
so we've used this to actually again
understand in the COVID 19 context,
why is it that patients with
diabetes are so much higher
risk of COVID 19,
worse outcomes of COVID 19?
And in fact, specifically,
if we look at the,
you know, we could look at diabetic kidney
disease patients and diabetic patients
and why is it that they're so vulnerable?
So I think all of you know at this point
that,
you know, ACE2
is the receptor in our cells
that's responsible for SARS-CoV-2
being able to get into the human cell.
So we had data from our collaborators
Matthias Crustless Group
in Michigan and others looking at patients
with diabetic kidney disease
and cell specific
RNA seq data for their kidneys.
Now what is really important is
and this is on here.
This was done before there was COVID,
right, so no SARS-CoV-2, no nothing.
This is literally what your kidneys
look like, and in this case,
you know, we actually use this data
to identify the specific cell type
that was ACE2
plus expressing that was responsible
for SARS-CoV-2
being able to get into the kidneys, right?
So if we look just at that cell type,
what did the kidneys of these patients
look like?
So it's better for those of you
who are no kidney biologist.
So it's
there are pretexts,
the deep tax,
and now we're projecting them onto
the networks, the kidney specific tissue
specific networks
that I've just told you about that.
No, nothing again about this.
And then on the left,
we have information of east2west signature
same cell
type from patients in the hospital
that don't have diabetes
but have severe COVID.
And so we're filtering
those cells from there.
You are in the same pretext
and we're looking at the expression
of that same cell type
in those patients and again
projecting it onto the kidney network.
And what we see
is actually the same module.
Basically, you can see that
all this viral stuff interferon right,
like inflammation in these decayed ACE2
plus B techs
who are not actually going through
any infection.
So essentially, the hypothesis
that this really show and we see that
same module here in the patients
that have severe COVID in the hospital
that don't have diabetes.
So essentially hypothesis
is that the beta x ACE2
plus P-TECH cells like the specific cells
that are responsible for ACE2 for the
SARS-CoV-2, getting
into the cells in our kidneys
are actually primed in diabetic patients.
They look sort of like infected
cells from COVID,
so they're primed for the viral entry.
And that may actually explain why
these patients are so vulnerable to COVID.
This was actually very important
because this was a year ago
when everyone was wondering
whether we should take all of the patients
that are hypertensive off
of ACE2 inhibitors, right?
And so this in another paper at the time
or two like really early papers
that showed that no, no, no,
it has nothing to do with that.
It's really something
about the state of the cells
that's inherent
and not about the hypertension medication.
And so, you know,
you can actually do all of these analysis
in our human based
human beings, though they all.
So you can look at all of these networks,
you can actually,
you know, for computational folks here,
of course,
you guys can actually download
any of these networks.
You do your own analysis, but you can also
do all these visualization.
You can do these functional module
discovery that I just showed recently,
as well as actually
look at the predicted impacts
of transcription
and post transcriptional variants.
You can upload your own variants
that will make your predictions
and allow you to download them
and also our open
source deep learning libraries
for biological sequences.
Well, is open source, so we'll be very
happy for people to use it.
And finally, I don't actually do anything
useful anymore,
like I'm just go around and give talks
and enjoy hanging out with everyone.
But it's really my amazing group
that's done all the work.
I think throughout.
I've acknowledged people who did the work,
but this is the entire group.
I don't think I had a chance
to acknowledge
the incredible human based team.
So Aaron Wong is really the project leader
of that human based project,
really the one who makes it all happen
in his group of software engineers.
And thank you very much.
I'd love to have some questions.
specific networks
that are really fascinating.
Just give us a summary of like
how different
are selling specific networks like to,
I think, 80% of the same or 20% the same.
So your
Because like for lazy people like me,
I would prefer,
I would prefer to assume
that they're all the same.
Your work has shown clearly that they're
not, you know, I want some rules of thumb
for how different
these tissue specific networks are.
It's a really good question,
and I don't have a percent
because of course, like, you know,
percent is not as relevant because a
huge fraction of them are very low.
You know,
everything has a connection, right?
It's a fully connected way to grab.
The vast
majority of connections are at very low.
They're basically not happening.
And of course, it depends on
how we have actually looked quite a bit,
and you can literally
reconstruct the sort of tissue hierarchies
out of just network similarities.
So they are pretty different
if you take very different cell types.
And yet you do find similarities.
If you look at cell types that are either
simple, like, for example,
if you look at epithelial cells
across different organs, there's a lot of
similarities, but you do see differences.
And then, of course, different lung
cells, for example,
will also have similarities,
but also some differences.
We do find that,
you know, just like in that study
where you know, the blood,
the blood network, right?
That wasn't one of the checks
we actually do.
It's a really good question.
We really try to look at do we find cell
type and tissue specific signal, right?
Because you can just run
the same analysis? Exactly.
So we'll do right.
So one of the,
you know, we do all of these, you know,
and this is actually, I think, important
for the students, right?
As post docs as you're thinking about,
this is right.
Like in addition to all the standard
evaluations, we're obsessive right,
and you have to be careful.
And obviously the stem of machine
learning,
careful of like, hold out not just cross
validations, et cetera, et cetera.
We always do
sort of complimentary evaluations, right?
Something that we didn't train for at all.
So for this, the obvious one is
can you predict disease genes, right?
Like so we will always do that.
And then that next question is like,
are disease genes for diseases
that are happening in that tissue?
You know, that's complicated.
But you know, at least on the gut
check, are they?
Is your network for like if you're
looking at diabetic kidney disease,
your kidney networks
better be more accurate than your,
I don't know, brain,
the liver that works right?
And if you're not getting an ideal,
if you know
the cell type, that would be even better,
right? Is that cell type.
So that's a really good checks
and we do do that and they are different.
I know I'm not giving you a percentage
of the kind of thing I was wondering.
He'll
say about UCSD great talk, as always.
So I'm intrigued by the idea of the cell
type specific genetic networks
in autism specifically.
And so one thing that we found
really remarkable in our latest
preprint was the which.
The last figure is not in the preprint
yet, but it's the cell type specificity
of exome protein coding variants in autism
compared to non-coding variants from G.
And what we found was that
is that there's a huge cell
type specificity
to all the protein coding variants
that they're highly enriched in excitatory
and inhibitory neurons.
But Zawya is associations
when tied to individual genes.
Very little cell type specificity at all,
which might make sense
in the sense that that protein coding
gene protein coding variants and probably
UTR variants are tied to the gene
to the gene level and the cell type
specificity of the gene matters
for UTR and protein coding variants.
But when you're tied to an enhancer,
it doesn't matter what's going on
at the gene level, it matters
what's going on at the enhancer.
And so I wonder, have you looked
at the difference between your RNA?
Seek cell type specificity data
and your attack?
Seek enhancer data?
And do you see a difference
between the cell type
specificity patterns at the regulatory
element versus the gene?
Yeah, that's a really good question.
And I love you guys work, by the way.
But yes, so not exactly that study,
but we have looked so actually,
I have a slightly different well,
let me answer,
and then I'll give you a hypothesis, bec
I wonder if it's a difference
between common versus rare or right like.
So what we do see,
I don't have like cell type specificity
all the way to that resolution,
but we have looked at, you know,
because we have those models,
we you know, what I'm showing you
is actually all the all, you know,
I said we have cell therapies
and of several, but honestly,
like, it's such a hard game,
as you know, in the regulatory variants
to get enough power that then
we integrate all of this and those,
you know, the graphs
that I showed for test
my actually all of these models
giving you one score .
Mm hmm.
But then you can actually go back to the,
you know, you can.
Without all the tissue culture
and just look at the tissue
specific models, right like that
are actually where it was trained
on the data from postmortem
actual tissue samples.
And then you can map where you see
the biggest difference
between the pro bands and siblings.
And it turns out there,
and I don't want to misquote,
but basically, I think all but
one are like all the top ones are brain
and embryonic, right?
So you do see it,
that's at the variant level or that's
so that's the, you know,
your you're looking at each variant
and then integrating across
all the variants like basically just the
where you have the biggest difference
between just regulate
broadband versus sibling dysregulation.
Mm hmm.
And there you do see a, you know, it's
definitely the brain.
But of course, that's not cell type
specific.
It's just, you know, sort of whatever.
They basically
the resolution is as nonspecific.
I think there were ten different
like brain, various regions of the brain
and embryonic goes up.
And we do see also a similar pattern
in our BP data as well.
So, you know, I wonder,
I wonder
if some of it is like common vertebrate
like because it may be
the common variants are indeed
like sort of these more broader
and but I don't know for sure.
Or it may just be that
we don't have quite enough data
or they're not they're not the regulating
at the level of the individual genome.
Oh yeah.
Exactly.
Regulating at yes, overall,
things like that could totally be it.
Exactly, exactly.
Oh, God. Hi.
Hi, nice talk, as always, thanks.
I'm Clay Mars for the rest of the people.
Don't know who I am this I.
We're very interested in seeing Weaver
and it,
as you know, I'm very interested in RNA
binding proteins in general
and and a lot of the proteins
that are coming up as the things that are
both on your slides and your paper,
as the major factors are like
not some of them are sequence specific,
but their core members
of the splicing machinery.
And there's things like UPF one,
which is like
not even sequence specific,
but mark splicing boundaries.
I'm wondering if have you tried training?
Seek Weaver using like also annotations
is some of your outputs as well.
It like perhaps some of these aren't
being produced, just surrogates
for first basic
like splice sites and through.
Yeah, that's a really good point.
We do find
I mean, one is we do actually find
a number of these, you know, the ones
I highlight are sort of the better study
because I want to be able to
then compare them right,
like to something
like the coding variant effects.
And so that selects for them.
We do find quite a few that are actually
quite sequence specific and
ones that are not just affecting splicing,
but affecting other parts of the RNA
metabolism.
We've looked at a number of different
like in addition to clip,
looking at other types of data.
And it, you know, basically
it's a trade off, right?
Like we ended up deciding to just
limited to clip because the accuracy
when we compare to in vivo
seem to be lower.
But that said,
I think in the long run,
we probably will have to make it
more broader and just decide
that we're going to be very careful
in how we evaluate and be able to include,
like more of this information, right?
But, you know, we haven't looked at it
recently in the beginning when we did,
of course,
did actually pretty careful study
of how we can look
at different types of data.
And it did look like
just limiting it to clip
give you a lot more accuracy
if you define accuracy as like in vivo
ability to predict in vivo outcomes.
So, you know,
that's why we made the decision,
but I don't know
if it's a hard and fast decision
long term.
Thanks a lot.
Well, let's thank Olga for a great.
