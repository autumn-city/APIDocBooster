Hello everyone.
Welcome to the episode 51 of SoLeadSaturday the guest we
have today.
Dr.
Ganapathi Pulipaka
He is a chief AI HPC scientist with over 20-plus years of
sap experience in project management of application development
technology integration of Business Systems design and architecture
9 plus years of experience in deep learning machine learning
data science by torch Python tensorflow, and our he has extensive
experience in This systems design management consulting project
planning and management in successfully delivering those
by collaborative program results by partnering with client
for sap and artificial intelligence with 31 projects.
Wow.
This is amazing.
He as so many years of work experience.
So it would be it would be going to be a very insightful
talk. So I'll just welcomed him and welcome doctor then particular
Baca very happy to have you on the show and we appreciate
all your time and consideration.
Sounds great.
Yeah, thanks for inviting me and having on your podcast.
Thank you so much.
Pleasure is all mine.
So moving towards our first section which is common to everybody
about the passion and the interest.
So how did you find your interest in the data science field
big data and AI what steps did you take to pursue that passion?
So I would like to begin, you know, that grass roots of Where
it All Began.
So actually when I was 16 years old the first time I actually
started as something of a CPU a computer on my own.
So I just wanted to see if I can assemble on my own like
wheat or burn to shop or anything.
Then I got all of the components and actually built and assembled
a computer and when I did there so since now the computer
so I started working on programming languages like C C++
visual C++, you know, apparently the same time going to school
and also for sharing all my programming language as worked
at the time and so as I started doing that I found some starting
opportunities and at the deja actually I saw there was a
requirement that the Air Force Academy actually looking for
implementation of of C++ programming language for their air
traffic controller.
So I went and personally and I spoke to them in this is there
are happy for me to do the project for make Urological Department
terms of understanding the different weather conditions that
they can decide whether plane takes off or which Runway is
going to land on, you know, all of its other so I did the
project and implemented for the Air Force Academy and they
were there have been using it for me.
You're some big news.
And after that there is another company which is electricity
being a mixer board actually and so they wanted to implement
a project to measure the consumption of utility and mirrors.
We're reading on the energy and stuff like that.
So I implemented all this type is typical methods for them
quantitative and qualitative methods and I've shown like
business the meter reading.
Or the customer can actually measure the utilization and
actually also compare the neighborhood where your people
are how they are considering works as how this person is
consuming applying different types of statistical methods.
And so actually the electricity board is still using the
product as of today and we were my first price so then I
really got interested into the data side of it because there's
a lot of stuff that can be accomplished because majority
of the stuff.
Everything is all about data.
So this one is standard working on a lot of projects and
I started implementing lot of products for various businesses
that they're mentioning about the business industry.
So I work for like chemicals industry.
I work for like Aerospace and utility energy and Life Sciences
Health Care good entertainment.
And one of the largest entertainment gleams in Los Angeles
at work with so there are lots of data that actually terrified
data on the business Warehouse inside for performing the
analytics. That was the largest positive work done that on
the side of the business warehousing and then I started running
lot of business analytics and getting the outputs and also
apply. Algorithms and I'm living around that you do projects
as of today.
Sometimes my profile may not be up to date.
I don't keep updating all time.
So and ever since I worked on all of this price then almost
a decade ago.
I also started into a data analytics side of it and like,
you know how degree and a specialization of running and business
analytics and the data.
Analytics for example like Tableau or Quicksilver, you know
and also Microsoft to power bi number of bi analytics tools
that I started picking up when I was when I joined it agree
with California University and our wine is almost a decade
ago, and then I implemented all this products and all of
these tools every possible analytics tools out.
Barry happened and then again, there was also some machine
learning and statistics.
I picked up from the leader of virtually a doctor of computer
science program where I was especially G more on the big
data. She'll any analytic side of it.
And then I did a postdoc with superhero Technical University
where I have actually implemented.
Of projects and especially on the high performance Computing
and how a specialization in high-performance Computing with
deep learning and I my dissertation is on the entire topic
and I don't know whether I am still debating if I should
publish it as a book or I should publish it in the research
paper, but that's like, you know, a large-scale visitation.
I have written a lot of research Publications already have
come forward to accept it.
For example, like a CM Which is popular research publication
and IEEE, you know and Springer nature link also contacted
me and and publish here.
I still don't have permanent publishes a book or I'm gonna
publish it as paperback the same time work a couple of books
right now and the books are the first book is about more
on the mathematics of that machine learning, right?
We could Implement our linear algebra or calculus applications
and how the Raging the python and or pie charts are tensorflow.
How can we go and implement this project and that's what
I'm currently working on a book and there's another vocals
on working for another Glacier, which is actually on the
reinforcement learning algorithms.
And so that's about the advanced systems of Robotics.
And how do we Implement reinforcement learning and that's
mainly I'm quite Arch already have completed few chapters.
I completed the chapter the first book but I still have a
complete all chapters and you know refining and fine-tuning
before I can publish and so those are my products in the
pipeline. Well, so you also busy activate the way I'm understanding
it. So you are trying to get it the knowledge from everywhere
and then you are sharing it as well.
So your books or through your work and the Six, so thank
you so much for everything around 400 research papers back
in the past.
And so these papers covered a wide range of topics.
I would he be able T.
And then you have the eggs is you have your several Frameworks
and a lot of applications covering a wide range of topics
including machine learning or other deep learning algorithm
natural language processing and also bio-inspired machine
and generally called and Robotics and considering that the
poster was the toughest player.
They have to be completely, you know, coming up with Innovative
Graphics every grief.
But I have to write not be the same as the other paper because
I'm especially also the most important thing is plagiarism
because you know, it's invited a lot of people probably lot
of Articles these days of the disc.
I mean, I literally take some of the articles that I paste
them into some of the plagiarism tools like, you know turning
there's a plagiarism academic tool so you can find out so
how will you pay somebody Zydeco that is going to show especially
tags the content like this is copied and pasted for even
their reworded it by copying you from particular research
paper newspaper article or Nu is going to show that up.
So that's the thing about goes back is like you can have
even a single word that is, you know, copy from somewhere
has to be completely original and completely authentic and
that's the only way the bigger is going to be even accepted
by the University.
Thank you so much.
Actually the way you are talking it shows your passion towards
the film.
So thank you so much for being my guest as well moving towards
our next question.
Next section is more about questions from the audience.
So I have shortlisted couple of questions for you.
The first question is, you know, what are the major challenges
when it comes to Big Data handling at organization level?
And what would be good Big Data strategy?
So Isabel depends on how much data company wants to handle
because It is primarily the company in our if they have like,
you know large-scale data than they are looking at several
Frameworks, like, you know, the conventional a most of the
people the rage Apache Hadoop, which is most popular tool
where it's leverage for the storage of people can sure large
volumes of data and Apache Hadoop and then they can process
it by applying different data mining algorithms like the
insides. That particular data and some of the other companies
like Jesus talking about utilities and energy companies,
you know, they need a lot of data in real time and they would
need streaming in genes that basically can capture the data
from different places and they, you know, get that data into
the data warehousing and then sometimes they have some iot
sensors and the inertial manufacturing plants because I work
for a client like that process all of this.
Tarun, I would instances and processes into Apache Hadoop
through up.
Watch this Parker Apache Flink.
Number of streaming engines are available out there you had
map are as its own data platform again when we are getting
the data, right?
So it's not always like we need to extract the data same
data over and over again.
We need to be able to go for that change capture because
you know, there is a data that came here.
8 and they give me feel retrieving the data.
We don't want to achieve the same data I came because it's
going to double up the whole wallet.
So we need to find a change between what has been transmitted
yesterday versus what is transmitted this morning.
Let's admit already unit from electricity or somewhere.
We are getting the data sources from so there is a data change
capture tool called division that actually captures the data
and then puts it into any of these.
- oh range units and there's also several other techniques
to do this because instead of putting in Apache Hadoop, which
may not be faster because it's a disk based system so we
can go to some of that fing memory Computing platforms.
So like for example sap has henna which is a high-performance
Appliance analytical tool that process is directed a Guinness
Book of World Records for handling largest Big Data.
Analytics where it has prizes like we're talking about life
better by itself.
Here are not like something like terabytes of data.
And again, if you are you have several other tools for that
purpose, like for example, yo Hazel cash.
You also have great gain, which is a in memory Computing
platform. So all of these buttons what they do is they keep
all the data on the memory keeping it on the disc because
we're getting the Beautiful the disc you have to make a round
diamond shape and then you're here to keep going.
You know, a lot of is feeling jeans you have noise feeling
genes to extract the data from these data sources and get
the theory to your data warehousing location.
So it's gonna be very complicated for extracting all of this
data, you know with any technique so it all depends on how
the company wants to do it, but they want to go for our in-memory
Computing platform or they're going to go for, you know,
any Apache Hadoop or this way.
Tools are they can also add some trimming engines if they
can in their data in real time or is something like the back
study really depends on the process.
Like, you know, people may have e-commerce applications running
on the web and then they need to process and website crashes
because you know, it all depends on the architecture that
needs to be designed is Julie depending on the business design
and the business requirement.
So that's when we can basically bring in all these necessary
tools that Come up with their big data strategy that works,
you know because not all the times, you know one size doesn't
fit all the case.
You take the approach that you implement or the data strategy
for one company that we go for implementing it for another
time being all this may not be the same because it will scale
the company understand that scalability of the server's infrastructure
how much data they need in terms of processing it and then
we need to come up with a creative strategy for Thank you
so much and next question is around, you know types of data
actually. So what is metadata Master data and transaction
data? So the modernity is basically the data surrounding.
How do we Define the attributes of this data, right?
So for example, like, you know, somebody is designing a scale
designed for multiple tables or views or you know, what they
need to do is first I need to define the metadata.
The metadata is primarily the way how you know, just think
about the universe.
So everything we see is metadata, which is like the actual
data. Like, you know, all of these galaxies that are populated
into the universe and you don't have a specific time and
space space time continuum and similarly when we are creating
a deal with you to know what type of data are you collecting
area connecting a vendor information or finding a dress or
something. So what does it mean in terms of defining the
attributes of the data that has been character feel is going
to be Stringfield was very floating point is going to be
integer into your car.
Five in all of their we can Define in the table and then
that becomes the metadata and then we start actually implementing
it we need to have the master data.
The master a is kind of like, you know, the Lynch pin that
holds the data together where we needed mandatorily to perform
any business transaction.
Like as I mentioned that I can render were talking about
a customer we're talking about the material product.
This is all master data and then there is always a lot of
Master data.
Our names that's required because we can just you know to
push some data and then just delivery because it needs to
be going I've used to be you know, in a way that helps actually
do I get the master data ready for the business organization?
And then we also have something called transaction your A
game transaction data is where you have maximum number of
transactions generated on a specific day.
For example, like if you have a Black Friday that you can
expect, you know, almost the translates in general.
Throughout the year in happen in a single day and if Black
Friday, so that's part is a transactional data.
So I was talking about the entertainment company.
So the manufacturer this Blu-ray discs and the manufacturer
the DVDs and stuff like that.
So when this third and you know, I'm a particular of Black
Friday just go crazy, you know, like millions of millions
of them looks like crashes and all that stuff can happen
in it.
Seeing deal our and you know, he knew downscale abilities
or when we are building a cloud computing platforms.
Are you doing you know scale with immense on do see how much
data we can accommodate is more better than to be prevent
development the reactivities on customers going to the website
and crashing the whole thing and then put a, you know, some
notice. Oh, no, we are all down.
And you know, we're going to be back in an hour after maintenance
or something.
That's not really good because you can scale and understand
and you know, we can can speed up any discs and the clusters
of cloud computing if you need to scale it up more and that's
what Amazon does because it stateful Computing.
It doesn't have any servers for us.
Like we're not storing the data physically and any servers
is everything in the cloud and also we can just process all
of the data, you know, most efficiently.
So that's how the transactional data needs to be designed
when they want to build a transaction.
They need to decide how we're going to put it in a cloud
computing platform for I'm just put it on some sort of database
or like, you know, if it's a healthcare industry.
They have a lot of complaints in terms of like, you know,
electronic data repairs.
They need to keep their compliance and they can just you
know, put the data out of there like, you know, people are
busy Park on planes is a very specific regulation of Health
Care industry.
So the electronic data records of the patients are being
protected so that you know, they're not being shared with
others in the whales can access So we need to put some security
regulations for such type of electronic data package.
So that the healthcare did of a person reminds more safer
than you know, putting it out there.
So there's a lot of cyber security rules provided by HIPAA
which are basically the government rules.
So that we can process it for that right industry at the
right time with the right scale.
Thank you so much for sharing and I'm sure that audience
would have benefited with the answers.
Thank you so much moving towards our next section is a more
like a fun segment.
So I'm going to give you three words and you have to tell
what comes to your mind immediately.
So are you ready?
Okay.
Yes, so the first word is passion.
When it comes to Fashion machine learning is my passion,
especially dealing with high performance Computing.
And as I mentioned also the in-memory Computing it can be
applied to a I not only for the big there and watching our
group and Apache Flynn can purchase part.
So basically you're going to apply this to like this is also
great Hardware like neuromorphic Hardware, you know, and
you know Marvin are there actually started all the way with
The transistors memory service capacitors and resistors and
more all the way and so that the data resides in the you
know, your Market hardware and then there is a specific neural
network that are defined particle spiking neural network.
So the spiking neural networks is exactly where you know,
we can steal the data with neuromorphic Hardware.
So that's my passion because I'm also writing a lot of water
and how we can implement it for supercomputing.
And how we can include in Blooming for nuclear fusion and
how we can Implement for a plasma turbulence, which is the
energy that we have in the wall is very limited because we
experience lot of outages where we don't get, you know, specific
electricity even people need so it's the reason that's why
people actually started moving towards nuclear fusion.
Is it something that we can you must get RS and actually
can extract energy from the way the Sun Prairie?
Is that you know helium and then builds a nuclear fusion
process. So that uses so much of energy so that can we, you
know rebuild that concept and can we think that for the Earth
where we can produce unlimited energy with nuclear fusion.
So a lot of supercomputing companies like Lawrence Livermore
laboratory is Sandia National Laboratories number of national
research libraries are implementing this nuclear fusion.
projects whether one of our news is because especially on
the heat generated, you know, just like almost extreme temperature
reaches almost like that center of the Sun that you can just
have it so they put something like like, you know, sometimes
some type of fixture so that that holds of the heat so that
you won't break down and into the laps and there's also like
a bomb simulation that people have started as soon as they
start getting you don't have Roots because earlier what is
to happen was, you know, before the invention of the computer
networks people use to buy, you know, bombard the islands
and just you know, and I highlighted and through just to
see and they said how when you give warmth explodes so and
there's still some of the nation's do that, but coming to
the supercomputer Davis's we got the supercomputers so you
can actually now do a bomb simulation in a Super computer
so we know the projectile of all the tragic story of all
of these explosions are simulations of particle physics are
occurring so that we can measure it and we can understand
we derived actually bombard.
This is all possible to supercomputing and high performance
Computing, you know couple with in memory Computing and neuromorphic
Hardware as well as spiking neural networks.
I believe that's where my passion is and you will More about
in my upcoming books out implement this type of applications.
Well, so I can see clearly your passion actually because
you're not you're like Unstoppable when it comes to your
passion. So thank you so much.
The second word is for you is more like research.
Yeah research again.
It's a very tough because especially researching is something
we can have something that's never produced.
It's completely unpublished manuscript that you know, people
are the come up with because they need to understand and
come with original ideas that are not being produced by any
other personal researcher for the record and make our practical
enough project throughout the world.
So I'm very interested in the research and you know, I mean,
I You know a lots and lots of research papers.
So maybe it's not that I only write.
I also read a lot of inspectors to understand how the researchers
have been moving towards the next generation of AI applications
and one of the type of applications are they implementing
is it supervised learning is it unsupervised are semi white
and semi-supervised learning are they implementing reinforcement
learning? What type of machine learning algorithm starting
point? How is it being more efficient?
Because again, they apply A lot of hyper parameter optimization
to tune the neural networks so that you know, if they're
applying path backpropagation.
Are they applying the forward propagation?
How do you get all of these weights are updated?
How do we activate the new network functions?
Especially when we start playing like, you know, there's
a lot of like Adam and you know, so different types of optimizers
are available so we can Implement is optimism measure.
Benchmark each of them and understand you know how that's
when we can publish Alyssa saying, okay, so we actually have
run this algorithm multiple hardware systems and we have
undergone multiple optimizers of neural networks, and we
can compare and see what's the best to go with the let's
this very interesting side of flurries that year.
Thank you so much.
I'm the next word for you is academic experience.
Yeah, I believe the economic experience is very important
because a lot of people Oh, you know, you know they implement
the projects like, you know women in the presidency in the
real world is not so different from work academic researchers
come up with their own thoughts and ideas how they implement
it because sometimes is very surprising that practical people
machine learning researchers implementing the projects actually
even their combat and that chick with the products that have
been implemented by economic commission.
So it's not you know, they come up with several consoles
because they and it's also you know so much of research,
you know that you can Implement and then you can come up
with for example MIT research perform so much of research
on it and recently the crowdsource reinforcement learning
algorithm for measuring the traffic and how do our we optimize
the traffic with reinforcement learning to build this in
JavaScript front-end and the The traffic roads like you know
on a multi-link freeway.
There are cars that are giving hardly get around because
there's still space and most of the time we see traffic conditions.
So, you know, I think the abilities the best issue of Open
Source and Outsource and crowdsource this type of product
so that everybody can participate in because 24,000 people
have participated on this and it is produced ninety six point
six million hyper parameters and their 512 Peter some simulation
will have the traffic is that I feel like you're the CEO
researcher possibly could not create a final 12 years of
our reinforcement learning traffic situations of last that
you need all of the people to collaborate together and you
know come over and work as a team and then you know understand
the different types of algorithms that they can Implement.
So I believe that this is only possible, you know, when people
are more connected to work.
Academics because people have the Practical projects are
scattered and don't have a lot of network.
I mean they do have some networks on LinkedIn but there is
more different application framework by people on the economic
side actually connect on the research side these products
and researchers and I kind of excited People working on the
project. Yeah, they're just so much for sharing the importance
of you know, academic research projects as well.
So thank you and moving towards our next question.
Next section is about career and work.
So you are an author of books which includes the future of
data science and pattern Computing Big Data appliances for
in-memory Computing a real-world research guide for corporations
to tame and Wrangle their data Big Data appliances for in-memory
Computing a real-world research guide for corporations to
tame and Render their data, would you like to share more
about it?
And don't like, you know, are you are applying to have the
free giveaway also, so that would be great.
Actually if you give some insights you already gave a couple
of that would be grateful just summarizes or basically this
book is about all the big data strategy is right.
Not only the Big Data strategy is the corporation's can adopt
but also like, you know, there are like, you know a number
of products 1950s onwards there are like 60 projects that
have been implemented.
And you know the book takes, you know, all of this products
and fix that deep dialect.
We are looking at Human Genome Project.
For example, how do they gather the data?
Whether tools that the bridge for the Human Genome Project
because back in the day there was no in-memory Computing
for the Human Genome Project literally like almost more than
a decade to understand and decode that Jenna right because
they did not understand how the genome works and how what
is it comprised of?
How are you know people can understand and analyze different
diseases what data tell us about it, you know clinical trials,
you know, various aspects of Life Sciences industry.
And if you're going for again Aerospace, you know that a
lot of you know, preventive maintenance and englishy of machine
learning and we did a tool that can be implemented from it
also provides those projects insights how people have a computer
and Aerospace sighs I like the talking about like Lockheed
Martin projects from Aerospace or we talked about US Air
Force you can find all of those projects how they are implemented
and all of these, you know projects and how they can actually
be leveraged for any other, you know, Airline Industries
because very important for Airlines to have this type of
geospatial applications that they know that you know when
a plane crashes for example, they don't want to discover
the to you know, decoding some box that they find and then
they're going to you know discover what's happening with
this gradual something that we can prevent so talks about
implementing all those Technologies and software and implemented
for a actual Aerospace customer at probably remember it's
about putting all these sensors in the Shell sensors, you
know, there's another company that has been successfully
implementing on a Bus IBM so they put like ten thousand sensors
on the wings of planes and the turbo engines actually so
they get the readings of the murine all of atmospheric conditions.
So instead of basically, you know deciding liver, for example,
the ground station has some kind of weather that tells them
okay. I'm going to get a you know storm and then so they
would understand but sometimes they can tell that there's
a storm.
Upcoming to get some of the catastrophic is that people encounter?
They don't know that they're giving you a storm because the
satellite doesn't tell them.
Well, they don't work this sensors to actually pick up these
data are really brightly on the fly in real time the capture
the data and get that into that sensors and they know that
and then also proposes a pig detouring plan.
Okay getting into the sun.
You can actually detour and get around it and you know, you
can You're not getting to the sun it also and then they wired
the turbulence altogether.
So these type of products are something where you can find
those and also regarding about the brain initiative again,
there's a lot of you know research that has been conducted
on the brain from 1950s is a lot of movement understood sir,
you know, like people are known that there are 87 billion.
Neurons in the human brain.
So how do we need seven billion neurons operate and how do
they communicate the neural Pathways and all the transmit
the data to synopsis and others in options get the inputs
and them fathers and produce the output for a person to make
a decision.
Because this is all about the predictive with so how you
know, the brain process and produce that output of a Predictive
Analytics is the same way on ones that machine to operate
the business Brain Project initiative, especially on the
data side of the machine learning that has been funded with
billion dollars.
They want to decode the brain understand how the neural Pathways
work. And how do they communicate and how can No, we actually
replicate that in a machine rather than you know, University
of UK and actually implemented as super Computing project
called Spinnaker and that's built with all processors with
580,000 pores of palm.
And so they're so again the talking about the brain the brain
has around 20 volts of electricity.
That's it.
Alec takes to process 87 billion neurons to get the output
of all of the dishes we can get so simultaneous and it's
so you know, so you can slow the University of New K.
So basically on the 580,000, you know course of processing
they're doing they want to seem that all the break but they're
working with this brain project.
And so they want to know how do we actually get this?
Be called different understandings of their brightness under
home supercomputer that built just for the purposes of brain.
So so these are the type of products you can find, you know
in my past work and also you can find in upcoming books more
products and packaging look like a plasma turbulence nuclear
fission National Security are weapons project like, you know,
unique URL special type of protein on the track that's going
next year.
Neighborhood would be carrying a lot of nuclear weapons.
Just yeah you struggling there.
But how do you contain all those nuclear weapons safely?
So that was not going to have problems.
So that's when you know machine learning is applying the
supercomputing and come up with a strategy of how to transfer
these nuclear weapons from you know, one place to another
for that.
So a lot of the price we found in the upcoming book and the
other products I spoke about are already in my existing book
without a big deal.
We'll be out in two men.
They are we run analytics and get the tools and dashboard
and you know, analyze the genomic set of in bioinformatics
Beckman about quantum chemistry quantum physics or talking
about certain project that the particle physics where you
know, we always know there's a standard physics model that
provides one of the particles like vodka electrons neutrons
or will happen.
What different types Love, you know, he wants measurements.
But again the tarp, there is another particle called the
most on which is actually, you know, something they think
it exists but it was always kept as any question mark on
the standard physics more the sun, which is in anywhere has
conducted this product on the particle physics.
They want to accelerate and cool.
I do know particles with particles like billions of particles
to see if Is a way you can find this post and so ultimately
they found this particle University really at a particular
scale then the so that's when the market is both on the standard
physics model.
So those are the you know type of projects and the particle
physics side that are very exciting.
Some of the spacecraft ever launched on Mars were run through
that reinforcement kind of Mesa has lat a lot of spacecraft
on to Mars as you know, right and moving towards our next
question is another area of your interest which is iot as
well. So would you like to share more insights around a I
am I TI OTS internet of things and how a I enabled iot creates
intelligent machines.
So iot is a very powerful concept Riser was talking about
is very very good in the Aerospace industry being I'll give
you a project of I would be helped.
I'll talk about a couple of Rights project that actually
was a prototype.
So basically, you know, every infrastructure right in the
world goes through aging because all the intersection gets
deteriorated for a period of time and if you can, you know,
the told the infrastructure for example We talking about
a bridge right so there was a recent bridge in Minnesota
that actually while are you know number of cars were traveling.
I collapsed bridge collapse and 13 people died on it the
cars. I don't know actual people over a number of cars.
So when this happened so what was the reason because they
did not know that the bridge cannot, you know whole, you
know, basically the sir.
Surface of the fridge is deteriorating because of number
of vehicles going through it.
And you know, they've been traveling under the bridge for
so many years and decades ago almost like 1900.
So how do we know that this bridge is going to collapse?
So the way we know that this fridge is going to collapse
has basically, you know, there was an invention that is a
company that invented.
You know, again, this is in Minnesota the sort of company
as internal sensor, which is only like $20 and so all people
have been doing that just put that sensor under the fridge
and it's so lightweight chip and you can just put it on the
bridge and the port like number of the sensors on the bridge
and when they put this sensors under breath what it does
is it actually measures the structural Integrity of the fridge,
so You know, how was it?
You know, it was before versus how it is now so they can
measure up and you know, there is some change that is occurring
in a if you actually try to start transmitting some signals
whether copy another Bridges, you know, kind of getting into
some sort of problem so they can take care of the bridge
and you know, they can actually come get some preventative
measure. So there are a lot of techniques to rebuild a bridge
or you know to structure it in a way.
It's not going to pull out.
So again, it's all the constants or less because it doesn't
require any batteries wire or any other type of fuel or anything
like that.
It's just operates on the light.
So just gets the light just the sunlight and it just stewardship
and events even in the night with the same life and then
we start the game.
It's connected to your cloud computing platform.
It's all the data in real time.
And you know, people will go into that and they actually
can analyze to see of the structure indicates to good sir.
But again, this is not implemented at that national scale.
But I think this is something very recommendable because
that would save a lot of lives people.
So this is a very good I were to project that has been implemented
by a company and the other file Turnpike and what is something
that I implemented again for Aerospace customer and this
product is actually have been quoted.
I've done as your cloud computing platform.
So again, if you are in a plane, you know the lot of panels
that are they did you have a floor panels and you have door
panels and your pals on the ceiling.
So this is our you know, the arrow pointing towards the structural
Integrity of the languages.
You can put any confidence obviously because even the plane
is supposed to carry so many passages.
So there are restrictions in terms of the weight how much
it can carry probably it is actually to, you know, put the
eyewitness insertion of panels so that the measure the structural
Integrity of the plane, so this Palace again We have it's
very hard to know when people have to do preventive maintenance
because there's sometimes run for years sometimes the time
for a couple of years.
If you don't know how long we will need this particular panels
to be there, you know how long it needs to be here.
So in order for people to know that so, you know the way
people usually go conventional is people go there, you know
the check.
Okay, the Palace of can think of Amazon good, although I
think I feel a little bit fluffy.
So let's not give you kind of And you know put him over there
and that's what we want to do.
So that's something you should do it because somebody staff
comes in from the plane things that have this panel is, you
know, not good today and the other guy says no, I think you
can hold that.
I don't think there is any power because there's no so there's
no other like a body sensor for right so they cannot measure
that so that's why we started implementing front.
Airplane can get stronger people are waiting for three hours.
You don't know when the plane is going to pick up.
It just has a mechanical problem.
We notice is the problem is the problem of the panel or door
panel or ceiling panel or whatever it is.
We gotta take attention and then to get the blame for it.
So now implementing a I wish I would've machine learning
so basically implementing the sensors in the I would lie.
There is a fractal geometry.
There's a specific brand.
Each of the mathematics called fractal geometry to the fractal
geometry is reveal the surface of any Metals where it does
is it basically understand that acoustic emission coming
from the surface of that and it measures the hollowness of
the structural Integrity of the inductor l so it transfers
the data if there is some acoustic emission because this
is a standard acoustic emission that is defined for a structural
Integrity of the panel.
Instead of parameter and if the motor coasting and he sent
them, you know, it's deteriorating.
So we don't have to get somebody to run through the get the
passengers travelling in the airport and all that so you
can just decide just by you know that I wouldn't necessarily
looking very good and we'll just put a that's it but this
is a product, you know Implement different customer and Aerospace
industry. Yeah.
So thank you so much and moving towards one more important.
Milestone I came across in your career profile which were
like, you know, you were CEO of deep Singularity LLC would
like to share more about that experience.
So the back in the day, you know, I was working for a different
company and then there was a transition video for me to buy
another company.
So that's when I started this company.
Mainly I wanted it to be more like, you know, there is a
press that is attached to it is a great company called.
High-performance Institute of Technology.
So that is actually press arm of give Singularity LLC.
So that is for publishing all the books in the book that
you were talking about earlier the big data plans this very
American University actually came from the first publication
of high performance Institute of Technology.
So that's where so basically the objective of this companies
to promote and you know, bring a various of Machining and
bring awareness of the I also encourage all the youth generation
so that they can participate they can contribute all of their
work and if they want to publish their books articles published,
so that is the purpose of the mission and objective quality,
whether they should bring awareness of machine learning and
you know for all the people so that they can start Working
on many times I start having different implementation plans.
So that's why I keep feeling water of stuff on machine learning.
So I want people to understand it and some people who are
interested can start working towards people's thank you so
much and our next text section is more about tips and advice
to the spire and so any tips and advice to the people who
are planning to get into this Ai and machine learning space
and trying to grow in this world.
So it is very good question that you asked so primarily what
I would say is that the fundamentals of machine learning
operate on mathematics.
So if somebody wants to implement a machine learning algorithm
requisite is that they need to have the molecular to the
audience that you're at least 35% of mathematics background
for them to understand how to implement this algorithm works.
So for example, like you are you example like if you're taking
a look at the backpropagation our particular character forward
propagation, it completely works on the calculus and you're
very very radios and differentiating either the update of
the weights of the neural networks and how we can correct
the errors and it's like the mind the brain have something
called plasticity to the plasticity the nature of the brain
is somebody, you know, making large calculation and the making
error obviously sometimes of reindeer on really go back and
correct their through the plasticity.
So this isn't the Neuroscience the same thing has been implemented
in a I called back propagation, but when it went on your
own network computes, a mix of Terror just goes back to the
same concept of plasticity and it just goes and fixes the
problem that is again pure math.
For example, like refer, you know, Gregory's Taylor series,
so Very very was a mathematician biking the page 16 68 and
he has defined this infinite sums of terms with a function.
We find for example has a function a of a is something where
we want to calculate infinite sums again.
It's it's infinitely differentiable.
So you can't do the first derivative, but you have the second
data we do you do and so on.
So when you accumulate all of this and then you can calculate
in the function connector Infinity where n equal to 0 so
it is the factorial for each decorator and exponential increase.
If you have you know, a is the actual parameter, we are calculating
this function for her to know that differentiation, so The
sort of this is very fundamental to understand these edible
concerts for you know in to see as the investors who like
to get into that state of science field.
So it's very important and critical for them to you know,
because it's not like, you know, a lot of programmers you
need to make sure that a lot of methamphetamine issues getting
to machine learning and we are establishing.
She'll try to get into the strategy is decided six aspect
is again something where people can you know, Apply for example,
I kind of want to know what is the log probability?
Why won't my episode of generations of reinforcement learning
so they can apply the strategy but it's important like especially
the concepts of back propagation or forward propagation to
do not work on status with the work on calories math.
There's very important to have that kind of a grown and understanding
correctly or they can do some take up some courses in calculate
so that they can understand how to implement this machine
and Because not always that uses the determine the outcome
of a predictable of the building.
You don't want to flip a coin, you know, there's going to
be a day of that statistic.
So I know I'm a probability of that coming years ahead.
I know the probability of that coming in but it doesn't tell
me you know, how do I measure the project kind of this?
I'm going into the air which is bad.
So I think it's very important.
A lot of people think statistic is sufficient to getting
the machine learning a statistician Bill sufficient billion
depends if the person's purely statistician probably never
needed magic hug because there's nothing to program and there's
nothing to run on the neural network.
So literally, you know, there is no necessity of crap.
So you don't leave bills what the machine and you can generic
wants to be You're deflecting you doing differently, then
you can have some math background to implement.
All of these objects are there is more theoretical explanation
of point of other statistics world where we can just implement
the actual programs Yep.
This is this was very insightful.
Actually Anna.
Hope that you know, all the other parents out there can find
it useful as well when they're trying to get into this field
moving towards the end of the show, which is more about the
leadership so our last segment Is like, you know one question
around leadership, so you are truly reading your passion.
So what is your leadership style and any specific leader
that you always follow or admire life?
so basically what I would like to tell is like, you know,
the you know, that first part leadership is actually is,
you know is not, you know, trying to you know, you don't
tell people, you know, you need to follow so it's something
where you know, the people have a passion to follow a leader
because you know, the understand why this person needs to
be Father it's depending on their passion their understanding
of Interest.
So you don't force the people into your journey asking him
to follow you as a leader.
So you just you know, the people just find the interest in
something they give inspired with what the leadership is
out of also Inspire the people in a way that you know, people
find something where they definitely want to follow the leader
because they think you know, this layer has something special.
Obviously there have something Innovative to offer and this
 has something you know, somebody, you know, you need
your inspiration from the field working machine learning.
I think that as a matter so so we just invite the people
into a journey of leadership.
You don't force people into the journey because that's not
the state actually great to hear that.
So, thank you so much for sharing and being my guest on the
SoLeadSaturday show.
It was completely privilege, and it was great listening to
you. As I am also like not like expert in this fiekd I am
also learning.
So it was very knowledgeable and insightful and hope audience.
You will also enjoy this episode and as I always say until
we meet happy leading, let's lead together stay safe.
Bye for now.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate the opportunity for being the part of your part
time. Thank you very much.
Thank you so much.
