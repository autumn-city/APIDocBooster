Then we will go on here again, it will receive receive the  hidden state and the cell state from the previous time step, the current time step input, output something and so forth. So that's how the LSTM cell class works.
An LSTM cell consists of three gates-- the input, forget, and output, as well as a cell state.
LSTMCell is an object (which happens to be a layer too) used by the LSTM layer that contains the calculation logic for one step.
Alghout it seems, because of its name, that LSTMCell is a single cell, it is actually an object that manages all the units/cells as we may think.
Basically you want to use one LSTMCell for each layer, and you should be careful on how to go from input to output, layer by layer taking into account the hidden states.
