 And inside the SQLiteOpenHelper class, I will be putting a database-- I will be creating that whole structure.  There will be onCreate, there will be onUpgrade, insert query will be there, and update, delete-- all those queries will be there inside one class.  That will be the subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper class. 
If old version is 3 and new version is 4, it will just run the upgrade logic for 3 to 4 
 In the onCreate method, you should add code that creates your database tables and if you like, you can also add code to add data. 
 So I'll move the cursor into the onCreate method. 
 I'll call the onCreate method.
