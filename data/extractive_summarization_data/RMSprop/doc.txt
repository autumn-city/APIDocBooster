Implements RMSprop algorithm.
For further details regarding the algorithm we refer to lecture notes by G. Hinton. and centered version Generating Sequences With Recurrent Neural Networks.
The implementation here takes the square root of the gradient average before adding epsilon (note that TensorFlow interchanges these two operations).
The effective learning rate is thus \gamma/(\sqrt{v} + \epsilon)γ/(v +ϵ) where \gammaγ is the scheduled learning rate and vv is the weighted moving average of the squared gradient.
