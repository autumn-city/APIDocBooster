 That means, it tries to make the learning rate inversely proportional to a sane cumulated history. 
RMsprop keeps the exponentialy decaying average of squared gradients. 
RMSprop uses a momentum-like exponential decay to the gradient history.  Gradients in extreme past have less influence. It modiﬁes AdaGrad optimizer to perform better in the non-convex setting by changing the gradient accumulation into an exponentially weighted moving average.
 So, that is the problem with the Adagrad  algorithm and in case of RMSProp instead   of using this cumulative or acumulative sum of  squared gradients the RMSProp takes exponentially   decaying average of the squared gradient.  And, it  does not consider the extreme past histories while   accumulating the sum of square gradient.  And, as  a result of this the algorithm converges rapidly,   once it reaches once your vector reaches  locally convex ball short of surface that .  And,   what you can do is we can assume this point once  it reaches that locally convex error surface,   that as if your Adagrad algorithm is initialized  at that point within that locally convex ball. 
 So, the algorithm  that we will talk about is what is RMSProp   which tries to address this problem  of Adagrad algorithm that is vanishing   learning rate as the time increases  as the number of iteration proceeds.  So, what is this RMSProp algorithm does  is instead of taking the accumulative sum   of squares of the gradients of the sum of the  squares of the past and gradients or this past   gradient starts from time t equal to 0.
