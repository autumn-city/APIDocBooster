 Now you see we've got it onCreate and an onUpgrade method. 
 And again, pass the control back to onCreate, because in onCreate, there will be a new table created for you. 
 In the onCreate method, you should add code that creates your database tables and if you like, you can also add code to add data. 
 I'll call the onCreate method. 
For what it's worth, it's also a bad idea to catch exceptions in onCreate().  If the method returns successfully (doesn't throw), the framework thinks the database was created successfully.
