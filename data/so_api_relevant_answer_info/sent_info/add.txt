You can undo git add before commit with
(to undo my entire initial add), only to get this (not so) helpful message:
git add .
git status
... lots of crap scrolls by ...
=> Damn, I didn't want to add all of that.
google "undo git add"
=> find Stack Overflow - yay
Didn't work though, because while add .
Next time I'm going to use -n to do a dry run and see what will be added:
Use rm --cached only for new files accidentally added.
will "un-add" everything you've added from your current directory recursively
Just type git reset it will revert back and it is like you never typed git add .
To clarify: git add moves changes from the current working directory to the staging area (index).
git add is just an easier-to-type alias for git stage
Pity there is no git unstage nor git unadd commands.
I found this great little post that actually adds the Git command (well, an alias) for git unadd: see [git unadd (hyper-link)] for details or..
An addition to the accepted answer, if your mistakenly-added file was huge, you'll probably notice that, even after removing it from the index with 'git reset', it still seems to occupy space in the .git directory.
So, which is the real undo of git add?
git add cannot be undone - safely, in general.
Let's recall first what git add <file> actually does:
If <file> was not previously tracked, git add adds it to the cache, with its current content.
If <file> was already tracked, git add saves the current content (snapshot, version) to the cache.
In Git, this action is still called add, (not mere update it), because two different versions (snapshots) of a file are regarded as two different items: hence, we are indeed adding a new item to the cache, to be eventually committed later.
I mistakenly added files using the command...
This is in general preferable, because it works in both scenarios: it also does the undo when we wrongly added a version of an already tracked item.
If our misguided git add overwrote a previous staged uncommitted version, we can't recover it.
Of course, this is not very critical if we just follow the usual lazy workflow of doing 'git add' only for adding new files (case 1), and we update new contents via the commit, git commit -a command.
If you create a tiny initial commit just for the sake of having one, after that you can git add -A and git reset as many times as you want in order to get everything right.
Use git add -i to remove just-added files from your upcoming commit.
Adding the file you didn't want:
Going into interactive add to undo your add (the commands typed at git here are "r" (revert), "1" (first entry in the list revert shows), 'return' to drop out of revert mode, and "q" (quit):
to add parts of files.
Changed a file and used git add ., or git add <file>.
The reason is that git add has two meanings:
adding a new file to the staging area, then undo with git rm --cached file.
adding a modified file to the staging area, then undo with git reset HEAD file.
Choose option 3 to un add files.
In my case I often want to add more than one file, and with interactive mode you can use numbers like this to add files.
I created a new file and added it to Git.
To undo git add, use:
Suppose I add the file accidentally, git add newFile.txt:
Now I want to undo this add, before commit, git reset newFile.txt:
git add myfile.txt # This will add your file into the to-be-committed list
Undo a file which has already been added is quite easy using Git.
For resetting myfile.txt, which have already been added, use:
For all added files:
Git's ability to craft commits exactly like you want means that you sometimes need to undo changes to the changes you staged with git add.
I found it easy to just do git add .
to add all files inside the subfolders and then git reset the few files that I did not want to add.
It is tedious to git reset one-by-one but still easier to just git add .
You want to add all folders and files but not fig1.png, and not SubFolderX, and not file60.py and the list keeps growing ...
Say, git_add.sh:
Then add all the paths to all folders and files you want to git reset preceded by git reset -- .
You can easily copy-paste the paths into the script git_add.sh as your list of files grows.
The git_add.sh script should look like this:
Then do source git_add.sh to run it.
If you have lots of files and folders that you always retain in your local git repository but you don't want git to track changes when you do git add ., say video and data files, you must learn how to use .gitignore.
Example -
Suppose you have added Home.js, ListItem.js, Update.js by mistake
[ (hyper-link)]
and want to undo/reset =>
Directories are added automatically
  when adding files inside them.
That
  is, directories never have to be added
  to the repository, and are not tracked
  on their own.
You can say "git add <dir>" and it
  will add files in there.
When you add a .gitignore file, if you are going to put any amount of content in it (that you want Git to ignore) you might want to add a single line with just an asterisk * to make sure you don't add the ignored content accidentally.
In other words, you need to add the .gitignore file to the index before you can tell Git to ignore it (and everything else in the empty directory).
The problem with using placeholder files is that you need to create them, and delete them, if they are not necessary anymore (because later on there were added sub-directories or files.
As mentioned it's not possible to add empty directories, but here is a one liner that adds empty .gitignore files to all directories.
It will add README files to all directories that are empty so those directories would be then added to the index.
Maybe adding an empty directory seems like it would be the path of least resistance because you have scripts that expect that directory to exist (maybe because it is a target for generated binaries).
You can ignore all of your generated files by adding the following to your root .gitignore:
Create an empty file called .gitkeep in the directory, and add that.
Add it to the index using a plumbing command and the empty tree [SHA-1 (hyper-link)]:
[code snippet]
Type the command and then enter the second line.
related to the above, some projects won't work without some folders (which is often a hint of a poorly designed project, but it's a frequent real-world scenario and maybe there could be, say, permission problems to be addressed).
Separation of concerns is always a good thing, and you can still add a .gitignore to ignore unwanted files.
Add a submodule to any repository (git submodule add path_to_repo)
This will add a folder and a file .submodules.
There's no way to get Git to track directories, so the only solution is to add a placeholder file within the directory that you want Git to track.
Another idea would be to add a README file explaining what the directory will be used for.
Adding one more option to the fray.
Assuming you would like to add a directory to git that, for all purposes related to git, should remain empty and never have it's contents tracked, a .gitignore as suggested numerous times here, will do the trick.
Now, if you want a way to do this at the command line, in one fell swoop, while inside the directory you want to add, you can execute:
Name the script whatever you whish, and either add it somewhere in your include path, or reference it directly:
With this, you can either execute it from within the directory you wish to add, or reference the directory as it's first and only parameter:
Then you add a broken symbolic link to this directory (but on any other case than the described use case above, please use a README with an explanation):
To ignore files in this directory, you can add it in your root .gitignore:
To add the ignored file, use a parameter to force it:
You could add something like a README file in there.
If your app depends on the folders being there (though empty), you can simply add a .gitignore file to the folder in question, and use it to accomplish two goals:
Tell Git there's a file in the folder, which makes Git add it to the repo.
You can stuff this file into every empty folder you want added to the repository.
If you want to add a folder that will house a lot of transient data in multiple semantic directories, then one approach is to add something like this to your root .gitignore...
You can fill up all of these directories with xml/images files or whatever and add more directories under /app/data/ over time as the storage needs for your app develop (with the README.md files serving to burn in a description of what each storage directory is for exactly).
It will allow you to create and remove .gitkeep files recursively, and it will also allow you to add messages to them for your peers to understand why those directories are important.
An easy way to do this is by adding a .gitkeep file to the directory you wish to (currently) keep empty.
See this [SOF answer (hyper-link)] for further info - which also explains why some people find the competing convention of adding a .gitignore file (as stated in many answers here) confusing.
Just adding a PowerShell version here.
Add a empty .gitkeep file in there
Rather than hacking a fake submodule into GIT, just add an empty real one.
To add an empty directory to you GIT repo:
Unfortunately I have not found any way to force which commit ID is used during checkout, so you'll have to manually check that the reference commit ID is e84d7b81f0033399e325b8037ed2b801a5c994e0 using git submodule status after adding the repo.
Among these files, some I want to add to git repository and some not.
Then I think maybe I can add this directory only and then deal with the seperate files.
So I google "git add directory only".
In my situation, I found I can just add one file in the new directory that I am sure I want to add it to git.
Just add a readme or a .gitignore and then delete it, not from terminal, from the github website, that will give a empty repository
Just add empty (with no content) .gitignore file in the empty directory you want to track.
If the key doesn't exist, it's added and points to that value.
To add multiple keys simultaneously, use [dict.update() (hyper-link)]:
For adding a single key, the accepted answer has less computational overhead.
If you want to add a dictionary within a dictionary you can do it this way.
Example: Add a new entry to your dictionary & sub dictionary
NOTE: Python requires that you first add a sub
before adding entries.
[This popular question (hyper-link)] addresses functional methods of merging dictionaries a and b.
To add or modify a single element, the b dictionary would contain only that one element...
Here's an example of how one might use the __setitem__ method to add a key-value pair to a dict, and a demonstration of the poor performance of using it:
Let's pretend you want to live in the immutable world and do not want to modify the original but want to create a new dict that is the result of adding a new key to the original.
There will be times when you don't want to modify the original (you only want the result of adding to the original).
If you're not joining two dictionaries, but adding new key-value pairs to a dictionary, then using the subscript notation seems like the best way.
However, if you'd like to add, for example, thousands of new key-value pairs, you should consider using the update() method.
Then you can add the new key and value.
I think it would also be useful to point out Python's [collections (hyper-link)] module that consists of many useful dictionary subclasses and wrappers that simplify the addition and modification of data types in a dictionary, specifically [defaultdict (hyper-link)]:
This operation therefore does two things: it adds a new key to a dictionary (as per question), and assigns the value if the key doesn't yet exist.
Without the use of defaultdict, the amount of code to add a new element would be much greater and perhaps looks something like:
Adding an element automatically initialises the list.
Add a dictionary (key,value) class.
This will add a new key: value pair in the your_dict dictionary with key = someKey and value = somevalue
To add a new key:
git add -A stages all changes
git add .
git add -u stages modifications and deletions, without new files
git add -A is equivalent to  git add .
; git add -u.
The important point about git add .
is that it looks at the working tree and adds all those paths to the staged changes if they are either changed or are new and not ignored, it does not stage any 'rm' actions.
git add -u looks at all the already tracked files and stages the changes to those files if they are different or if they have been removed.
It does not add any new files, it only stages changes to already tracked files.
git add -A is a handy shortcut for doing both of those.
You can test the differences out with something like this (note that for Git version 2.x your output for git add .
With [Git 2.0, git add -A is default: git add .
equals git add -A .
git add <path> is the same as "git add -A <path>" now, so that
  "git add dir/" will notice paths you removed from the directory and
  record the removal.
In older versions of Git, "git add <path>" ignored removals.
You can say "git add --ignore-removal <path>" to
  add only added or modified paths in <path>, if you really want to.
git add -A is like git add :/ ([add everything from top git repo folder (hyper-link)]).
Note that git 2.7 (Nov. 2015) will allow you to add a folder named ":"!
Note that [starting git 2.0 (Q1 or Q2 2014) (hyper-link)], when talking about git add .
in the other git add commands as well.
"git add -A ."
is equivalent to "git add .
; git add -u ."
for git add -A and git add -u)
Because git add -A or git add -u would operate (starting git 2.0 only) on the entire working tree, and not just on the current path.
Because there will be no mechanism to make "git add -u" behave as if "git add -u .
", it is important for those who are used to "git add -u" (without pathspec) updating the index only for paths in the current subdirectory to start training their fingers to explicitly say "git add -u ."
git add -A is equivalent to git add --all
git add -u is equivalent to git add --update
git add -u and git add -A in a subdirectory without paths on the command line operate on the entire tree.
git add .
and git add -A .
add new/modified/deleted files in the current directory
git add --ignore-removal .
adds new/modified files in the current directory
git add -u .
adds modified/deleted files in the current directory
Without the dot, add all files in the project regardless of the current directory.
I hope this may add some more clarity.
Important background knowledge about how Git 'adds':
Empty folders are never added by Git.
(A workaround is to add a blank file, possibly invisible, to the tracked files.)
-u = --update = subset to tracked files => Add = No; Change = Yes; Delete = Yes.
=> if the item is recognized, git add -A will find it and add it.
However, in v2.0, the operation can be limited to the current path: just add the explicit dot suffix (which is also valid in Git 1.9 or earlier);
git add -A .
git add -u .
Ensure any hunks/files to be added are accounted for in git status.
If any items are missing, due to invisible files/folders, add them separately.
From the top level of the repository, "git add -A"  to add all items.
git add .
equals git add -A .
adds files to index only from current and children folders.
git add -A adds files to index from all folders in working tree.
If you are located directly at the working directory, then git add -A and git add .
If you are in any subdirectory of the working directory, git add -A will add all files from the entire working directory, and git add .
will add files from your current directory.
The -A option adds, modifies, and removes index entries to match the working tree.
is added that limits the scope of the update to the directory you are currently in, as per the [Git documentation (hyper-link)]
One thing that I would add is that if the --interactive or -p mode is used then git add will behave as if the update (-u) flag was used and not add new files.
Both git add .
and git add -A will stage all new, modified and deleted files in the newer versions of Git.
The difference is that git add -A stages files in "higher, current and subdirectories" that belong to your working Git repository.
But doing a git add .
If your current working directory is /my-repo, and you do rm rootfile.txt, then cd subfolder, followed by git add ., then it will not stage the deleted file.
But doing git add -A will certainly stage this change no matter where you perform the command from.
Or, hey, here's another option:  just don't add "use strict" to any of your legacy code, it's probably safer that way, honestly.
DEFINITELY DO NOT add "use strict" to any modules you do not own or maintain, like third party modules.
When adding "use strict";, the following cases will throw a SyntaxError before the script is executing:
ECMAScript 5 adds a list of reserved words.
"use strict" is widely needed to be used in ECMA5, in ECMA6 it's part of JavaScript by default, so it doesn't need to be added if you're using ES6.
That means additional checks need to be done.
In addition, we can write more optimized code.
This is done by adding the below line of code in your JS file.
Additional tip: To maintain code quality using strict mode, you don't need to write this over and again especially if you have multiple .js file.
You should check the [ADD (hyper-link)] and [COPY (hyper-link)] documentation for a more detailed description of their behaviors, but in a nutshell, the major difference is that ADD can do more than COPY:
ADD allows <src> to be a URL
Referring to comments below, the ADD [documentation (hyper-link)] states that:
Note that the [Best practices for writing Dockerfiles (hyper-link)] suggests using COPY where the magic of ADD is not required.
Same as 'ADD', but without the tar and remote URL handling.
Because image size matters, using ADD to fetch packages from remote URLs is strongly discouraged; you should use curl or wget instead.
That way you can delete the files you no longer need after they've been extracted and you won't have to add another layer in your image.
For other items (files, directories) that do not require ADD’s tar auto-extraction capability, you should always use COPY.
ADD or COPY
Although ADD and COPY are functionally similar, generally speaking, COPY is preferred.
That’s because it’s more transparent than ADD.
COPY only supports the basic copying of local files into the container, while ADD has some features (like local-only tar extraction and remote URL support) that are not immediately obvious.
Consequently, the best use for ADD is local tar file auto-extraction into the image, as in ADD rootfs.tar.xz /.
If you want to add a xx.tar.gz to a /usr/local in container, unzip it, and then remove the useless compressed package.
For ADD:
ADD supports local-only tar extraction.
Besides it, COPY will use three layers, but ADD only uses one layer.
From Docker docs:
[https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#add-or-copy (hyper-link)]
"Although ADD and COPY are functionally similar, generally speaking, COPY is preferred.

ADD and COPY are not stackable because they run in a standalone container and subsequent commands on those files that execute in additional containers will multiply the image size:
When I compared the docker image size created using ADD it was 180MB bigger than the one created using COPY, tar -xzf *.tar.gz and rm *.tar.gz
This means that although ADD removes the tar file, it is still kept somewhere.
ADD copies a file/directory from your host to your image, but can also fetch remote URLs, extract TAR files, etc...
Use ADD for downloading remote resources, extracting TAR files, etc..
Source: [https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/docker-tip-2-the-difference-between-copy-and-add-in-a-dockerile (hyper-link)]:
COPY and ADD are both Dockerfile instructions that serve similar purposes.
ADD lets you do that too, but it also supports 2 other sources.
A valid use case for ADD is when you want to extract a local tar file into a specific directory in your Docker image.
When creating a Dockerfile, there are two commands that you can use to copy files/directories into it – ADD and COPY.
Let’s start by noting that the ADD command is older than COPY.
Since the launch of the Docker platform, the ADD instruction has been part of its list of commands.
The basic syntax for the ADD command is:
If the source is a directory, ADD copies everything inside of it (including file system metadata).
For instance, if the file is locally available and you want to add it to the directory of an image, you type:
ADD can also copy files from a URL.
An additional feature is that it copies compressed files, automatically extracting the content in the given destination.
Due to some functionality issues, Docker had to introduce an additional command for duplicating content – COPY.
Unlike its closely related ADD command, COPY only has only one assigned function.
Considering the circumstances in which the COPY command was introduced, it is evident that keeping ADD was a matter of necessity.
Docker released an official document outlining best practices for writing Dockerfiles, which explicitly advises against using the ADD command.
Docker’s official documentation notes that COPY should always be the go-to instruction as it is more transparent than ADD.
The Docker team also strongly discourages using ADD to download and copy a package from a URL.
By doing so, you avoid creating an additional image layer and save space.
But you used ADD, then Docker will take care of everything for you and only one intermediate image will be created.
ADD and COPY both have same functionality of copying files and directories from source to destination but ADD has extra of file extraction and URL file extraction functionality.
The best practice is to use COPY in only copy operation only avoid ADD is many areas.
The link will explain it with some simple examples [difference between COPY and ADD in dockerfile (hyper-link)]
ADD instruction copies files or folders from a local or remote source and adds them to the container's file system.
ADD instruction unpacks local .tar files to the destination image directory.
COPY copies files from the working directory and adds them to the container's file system.
For instruction <src> <dest>, if <src> is a tar compression file and <dest>doesn't end with a trailing slash:
ADD consider <dest> as a directory and unpack <src> to it.
Beware when the column you are adding has a NOT NULL constraint, yet does not have a DEFAULT constraint (value).
When adding a nullable column, WITH VALUES will ensure that the specific DEFAULT value is applied to existing rows:
And furthermore, if you want to add the same column (if it does not exists) to all tables in database, then use:
In SQL Server 2008-R2, I go to the design mode - in a test database - and add my two columns using the designer and made the settings with the GUI, and then the infamous Right-Click gives the option "Generate Change Script"!
Alternatively, you can add a default without having to explicitly name the constraint:
To add a column to an existing database table with a default value, we can use:
Here is another way to add a column to an existing database table with a default value.
A much more thorough SQL script to add a column with a default value is below including checking if the column exists before adding it also checkin the constraint and dropping it if there is one.
These are two ways to add a column to an existing database table with a default value.
If you want to add multiple columns you can do it this way for example:
SQL Server + Alter Table + Add Column + Default Value uniqueidentifier
SQL Server + Alter Table + Add Column + Default Value uniqueidentifier...
Add a column to the table (or click on the column you want to update if
it already exists)
Add a new column to a table:
From this query you can add a column of datatype integer with default value 0.
Add one column to it:
The table is created and a column is added to an existing table with a default value.
This has a lot of answers, but I feel the need to add this extended method.
This seems a lot longer, but it is extremely useful if you're adding a NOT NULL field to a table with millions of rows in an active database.
What this will do is add the column as a nullable field and with the default value, update all fields to the default value (or you can assign more meaningful values), and finally it will change the column to be NOT NULL.
The reason for this is if you update a large scale table and add a new not null field it has to write to every single row and hereby will lock out the entire table as it adds the column and then writes all the values.
This method will add the nullable column which operates a lot faster by itself, then fills the data before setting the not null status.
Additionally, if you have a table in the area of billions of rows it may be worth batching the update like so:
FIRST YOU HAVE TO ALTER TABLE WITH ADD a FIELD
If you want to add constraints then:
This will add a new column into the Table.
For example, to add a new column [Column1] of data type int with default value = 1 into an existing table [Table1] , you can use below query:
ALTER table dataset.tablename
ADD column_current_ind integer DEFAULT 0
IGNORE pertains to how the ALTER statement will deal with duplicate value in the column that has newly added constraint UNIQUE.
what column or index you are adding, dropping or modifying, or what constraints you are applying on the column.
You can also add images with simple HTML tags:
Then direct reference to the address of the image file .
Create an issue regarding adding images
Add the image by drag and drop or by file chooser
Now add !
Alternatively you can use some image hosting site like imgur and get it's url and add it in your README.md file or you can use some static file hosting too.
An external CDN like imgur adds another tool to the chain.
Commit your image (image.png) in a folder (myFolder) and add the following line in your README.md:
Afterwards add them via git add command.
Also you can upload the image first then visit the location in your projects github page and navigate through until you find the image then press the download button and then copy-paste the url from the browser's address bar.
Just add an <img> tag to your README.md with relative src to your repository.
I am just extending or adding an example to the already accepted answer.
Consider using a table if adding multiple screenshots and want to align them using tabular data for improved accessibility as shown here:
If your markdown parser supports it you could also add the role="presentation" WIA-ARIA attribute to the TABLE element and omit the th tags.
there might be an issue occur of spacing so make sure if there is any space b/w two words of path or in image name add-> %20.
| col 1      | col 2      |

Add image in your repository from upload file option then in README file
Copy the url from the browser address bar, that is your "image_url" to be used in above referred syntax.
For images hosted in your own github repository you can use relative path in addition to the above url format
!
Step by step process,
First create a folder ( name your folder ) and add the image/images that you want to upload in Readme.md file.
( you can also add the image/images in any existing folder of your project. )
After adding image, you can see preview of changes in the, "Preview Changes" tab.you will find your image here.
For adding multiple images, you can do it like this,
If it contain spaces then you need to add %20 for each space between the file name.
Example - Commit your image.png in a folder (myFolder) and add the following line in your README.md:
DaRKoN_ [suggests (hyper-link)] appending to the tbody rather than adding content after the last tr.
This gets around the issue of having no rows, but still isn't bulletproof as you could theoretically have multiple tbody elements and the row would get added to each of them.
You can use this great [jQuery add table row (hyper-link)] function.
You can add anything to your table like this:
Therefore, this plays nicer with nested tables, if you don't want the nested table to be changed, but instead add to the overall table.
For the best solution posted here, if there's a nested table on the last row, the new row will be added to the nested table instead of the main table.
I found this [AddRow plugin (hyper-link)] quite useful for managing table rows.
Though, Luke's [solution (hyper-link)] would be the best fit if you just need to add a new row.
will add a new row to the first TBODY of the table, without depending of any THEAD or TFOOT present.
Adding a row uses counter+1 identifier, and the current value is maintained in the data attribute.
As i have also got a way too add row at last or any specific place so i think i should also share this:
and then use below code to add your row:
To add a good example on the topic, here is working solution if you need to add a row at specific position.
The extra row is added after the 5th row, or at the end of the table if there are less then 5 rows.
Refer Datatables fnAddData [Datatables API (hyper-link)]
If you want to add row before the <tr> first child.
If you want to add row after the <tr> last child.
for combine this way with jQuery, only add new plugin similar this to jQuery:
Add tabe row using JQuery:
if you want to add row after last of table's row child, you can try this
if you want to add row 1st of table's row child, you can try this
The answers above are very helpful, but when student refer this link to add data from form they often require a sample.
To add a new row at the last of current row, you can use like this
Also you can add inner data as like
When You Click on Add row button then one more row Added.
Then you can use a back-end language to add your data to the table.
And now add new Origin using gitbash
git remote add origin (Copy HTTP URL from your project repository in bit bucket)
done
Click "Add" to add a remote repository path to the repository.
Click 'OK' to add the remote path.
The new remote path should be added on the repository now.
If you need to edit an already added remote path, just click the 'Edit' button.
Put a script file $HOME/.ssh/agent to let it runs ssh-add using [expect (hyper-link)] as below:
To add more upstreams:
git remote add newplace <url>
An alternative approach is to rename the 'old' origin (in the example below I name it simply old-origin) and adding a new one.
An important reason is to add one and only one variable as the "Root" of your namespace...
Sometimes I have to add new functions to do new branding-specific things.
The name of the function is not added to the scope in which the expression appears; the name is in scope within the function itself:
I'm adding my own answer just because everyone else has covered the hoisting part thoroughly.
[Greg's Answer (hyper-link)] is good enough, but I still would like to add something to it that I learned just now watching [Douglas Crockford's (hyper-link)] videos.
The following works because function add() is scoped to the nearest block:
The following does not work because the variable is called before a function value is assigned to the variable add.
Note that explicitly assigning add = undefined is superfluous because simply doing var add; is the exact same as var add=undefined.
The following does not work because var add= begins an expression and causes the following function add() to be an expression instead of a block.
As function add() is an expression here, it has no surrounding block, so it is only visible to itself.
Normal var add=function(){}
Normal function add(){}
Arrow Function with var add=function()
Arrow Function With function add()
Providing a name for your function expression quite effectively addresses all these drawbacks, and has no tangible downsides.
I just wanted to add in this 2019 a little app to search for all files in a dir and be able to open them by doubleclicking on the name of the file in the list.
That has consequences related to another keyword in the question: "add them into a list":

In pre Python 2.2 versions, sequences (iterables) were mostly represented by lists (tuples, sets, ...)
In Python 2.2, the concept of generator ([[Python.Wiki]: Generators (hyper-link)]) - courtesy of [[Python 3]: The yield statement (hyper-link)]) - was introduced.
[[man7]: OPENDIR(3) (hyper-link)] / [[man7]: READDIR(3) (hyper-link)] / [[man7]: CLOSEDIR(3) (hyper-link)] via [[Python 3]: ctypes - A foreign function library for Python (hyper-link)] (POSIX specific)

[ctypes (hyper-link)] is a foreign function library for Python.
os.listdir and os.scandir use opendir / readdir / closedir ([[MS.Docs]: FindFirstFileW function (hyper-link)] / [[MS.Docs]: FindNextFileW function (hyper-link)] / [[MS.Docs]: FindClose function (hyper-link)]) (via [[GitHub]: python/cpython - (master) cpython/Modules/posixmodule.c (hyper-link)])
For production, error handling should be added as well
I will thus add a solution for a subset of the problem: quite often, we only want to check whether a file matches a start string and an end string, without going into subdirectories.
This solution could be easily generalized with regular expressions (and you might want to add a pattern argument, if you do not want your patterns to always stick to the start or end of the filename).
additional desc params for Ege Özcan code
I add new functionality to objects like this:
The main addition here will be to walk down the object tree and determine the value of the last leaf, you have to specify, as well as any intermediary leaf.
It's good not to add a framework for every simple piece of logic, but relying on well tested utility frameworks can speed up development and reduce the amount of bugs.
I would like to add that localeCompare supports two parameters: language and additional [rules  (hyper-link)]
There are two ways to add new properties to an object:
In that case, the preferred way to add a field to an Object is to just assign to it, like so:
You can either add it this way:
In case you have multiple anonymous Object literals inside an Object and want to add another Object containing key/value pairs, do this:
will add Object {name="Peanuts", value="12"} to the Comicbook Object
According to Property Accessors defined in ECMA-262([http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-262.pdf (hyper-link)], P67), there are two ways you can do to add properties to a exists object.
Adding by obj['key'] or obj.key are all solid pure JavaScript answers.
However both of LoDash and Underscore libraries do provide many additional convenient functions when working with Objects and Arrays in general.
The second object will overwrite or add to the base object.
The second object will overwrite or add to the base object.
The second object contains defaults that will be added to base object if they don't exist.
In addition, it may be worthwhile mentioning jQuery.extend, it functions similar to _.merge and may be a better option if you already are using jQuery.
The second object will overwrite or add to the base object.
The second object will overwrite or add to the base object.
Either obj['key3'] = value3 or obj.key3 = value3 will add the new pair to the obj.
However, I know jQuery was not mentioned, but if you're using it, you can add the object through $.extend(obj,{key3: 'value3'}).
And it also allows recursive adds/modifications with $.extend(true,object1,object2);:
And we want to add prop2 : 2 to this object, these are the most convenient options:
However, the dot operator is not capable of adding dynamic keys to an object, which can be very useful in some cases.
supported by most of browsers, and it checks if object key available or not you want to add, if available it overides existing key value and it not available it add key with value
With the previous syntax you can now use the spread syntax {...foo, ...bar} to add a new object without mutating your old value:
We can add a key/value pair to a JavaScript object in many ways...
CASE - 1 : Expanding an object
Using this we can add multiple key: value to the object at the same time.
The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.
You can add property in an object like this
Using setDate() to add a date wont solve your problem, try adding some days to a Feb month, if you try to add new days to it, it wont result in what you expected.
That is why I use setTime() when I need to add days.
Also, one can add/sub any offset for years, months, days etc.
Just spent ages trying to work out what the deal was with the year not adding when following the lead examples below.
If you want to just simply add n days to the date you have you are best to just go:
The only time this answer works is when the date that you are adding days to happens to have the current year and month.
Reference: [http://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/add/ (hyper-link)]
Meaning if you add a number of days that cross DST, the displayed time (hour) will change to reflect that.
What we do here is convert days to milliseconds and add this value to the value provided by getTime.
Very simple code to add days in date in java script.
By the way, this is generic solution for adding seconds or minutes or days whatever you want.
Add 17 days to today
This way, if one day Javascript implements a native addDays method, you won't break anything.
Let's assume you store the number of days to add in a variable called days_to_add.
With Date.now() you get the actual unix timestamp as milliseconds and then you add as many milliseconds as you want to add days to.
Here is the way that use to add days, months, and years for a particular date in Javascript.
the simplest answer is, assuming the need is to add 1 day to the current date:
Create a variable to save the number of day(s) to add to the date (you can skip this variable and use directly the value in the third line)
The key is to get UTC Time and then use milliseconds to do the addition to bypass those side effects.
It's like [push (hyper-link)], except it adds elements to the beginning of the array instead of the end.
unshift/push - add an element to the beginning/end of an array
To add an item to the beginning, you want to use splice:
The unshift/push add an item to the existed array from begin/end and shift/pop remove an item from the beginning/end of an array.
But there are few ways to add items to an array without a mutation.
the result is a new array, to add to the end of array use below code:
To add to begin of original array use below code:
With the above way, you add to the beginning/end of an array without a mutation.
you can first reverse array and then add elem to array then reverse back it.
I found this happened in a brand new repository after I Git added only a directory.
As soon as I added a file (e.g.
This happens when you have added your file, forgot to commit and pushing.
First I removed all the files in the current directory and created README added it.
Added some more.
Missing or skipping git add .
For me I had to make sure the public key is properly configured on the server (appended in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys) and in [GitHub (hyper-link)]/[Bitbucket (hyper-link)] (added to my SSH keys on GitHub or Bitbucket) - they need to match.
git add .
First, git add .
In my case the issue, occuring on Windows, seemed to have something to do with us adding a prefix like feature\ to branch names.
However, you have to add at least SOMETHING to commit, so I just created an empty text file, git add .
"Add" the files;
I got this problem while adding an empty directory.
Just add an initial commit.
git add .
And, then, after adding the origin (or whatever name you give to your remote) push the branch:
Make sure you've added first, and then commit/ push:
Then all I did was add my email and name globally and then committed again:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOURusername/YOURrepo.git
While copy pasting the suggested line of codes above, I was not waiting for my processor to actually finish the add .
The proof of this is when I typed git status usually I get green fonts for the files added.
As if it was not added at all.
I typed git add .
and waited for the files to finish being added.
You probably forgot the command "git add ."
I did: git fetch && git checkout 'add remote branch name here' and it solved my problem.
Sometimes the problem occurs when you don't stage your changes, so to do this you need to run the following git command:
git add your_file_name.extension or git add .
to add all changes.
After you started git, then continue with git add.
If you've added the changes by running git add command(i.e git add .
git add .
git remote add origin <remote repository URL past here from the github repository> then type git remote -v
To send to your github repo first ensure that your username and email has been added:
That means adding and committing new commits will be done on 'main' branch, even if the Git client still consider master as the default branch.
For me, I had changed the branch name from add-status-conditions to add-status-condition and failed to notice the missing s at the end.
Renamed the branch correctly and did git push origin add-status-conditions -f.
git init
git add .
But as you can see my mistake was not using the git add .
My solution is to use git add .
Use [element.classList.add (hyper-link)] to add a class:
Add a space plus the name of your new class to the className property of the element.
Assuming you're doing more than just adding this one class (eg, you've got asynchronous requests and so on going on as well), I'd recommend a library like [Prototype (hyper-link)] or [jQuery (hyper-link)].
So let's say you've got jQuery on your page now, you could use code like this to add a class name to an element (on load, in this case):

YAHOO.util.Dom.addClass('div1','className');
From there you can easily derive the javascript necessary to add a new class... just append a space followed by the new class to the element's className property.
The easiest way to do this without any framework is to use [element.classList.add (hyper-link)] method.
I prefer not having to add any empty space and duplicate entry handling myself (which is required when using the document.className approach).
You can use the classList.add OR classList.remove method to add/remove a class from a element.
The above code will add(and NOT replace) a class "anyclass" to nameElem.
To add, remove or check element classes in a simple way:
To add just use
Another approach to add the class to element using pure JavaScript
For adding class:
Cross Compatible
In the following example we add a classname to the <body> element.
[jsPerf Test Case: Adding a Class (hyper-link)]
In first example we get our element's id and add e.g.
In second example we get element's class name and add 1 more.
To add a class to an element, without removing/affecting existing values, append a space and the new classname, like so:
Below code extends many answers above and improves them by avoiding adding duplicate classes.
If you have multiple classes where you want to add new class, you can use it like this
I too think that the fastest way is to use Element.prototype.classList as in es5: document.querySelector(".my.super-class").classList.add('new-class')
but in ie8 there is no such thing as Element.prototype.classList, anyway you can polyfill it with this snippet (fell free to edit and improve it):
First approach helped in adding the class when second approach didn't work.
I also did the same thing for the second children of a specific div in my DOM as you can see in the code where I used $('#deals-index > div:eq(0) > div:eq(1)').addClass('doubleheaderredesign');.
[Exceptional C++ (hyper-link)] (Herb Sutter)  Presented as a set of puzzles, this has one of the best and thorough discussions of the proper resource management and exception safety in C++ through Resource Acquisition is Initialization (RAII) in addition to in-depth coverage of a variety of other topics including the pimpl idiom, name lookup, good class design, and the C++ memory model.

Of course you can add jars to that folder.
If you need these jars for compilation, check this related question: [Can I add jars to maven 2 build classpath without installing them?
You can add local dependencies directly (as mentioned in [build maven project with propriatery libraries included (hyper-link)]) like this:
The last but not least thing to do is to add the JAR file to local repository using -DlocalRepositoryPath switch like so:
It's useful when a provider doesn't have a public repository and you need to add lots of libraries  manually.
Just add a local repo inside your <project> of your pom.xml:
Add the following lines in your pom.xml file
[code snippet]
Add your own local JAR in POM file and use that in maven build.
Then add it to the POM like this:
First, add the path (where you store the local .jars) as a property.
Then, under plugins add a plugin to install the jars when compiling.
Finally, in dependencies, you can add the jars
Now when you mvn install or mvn test local jars will be added automatically.
In Apache Maven 3.5.4, I had to add double quotation.
Add a standard Maven repository directory called repo for the group com.example and version 1.0:
add repo in your pom file:
add the dependency in your pom:
Make sure to edit the file path based on your actual file path (recommended is to place these external non-maven jars inside some folder, let's say lib, and place this lib folder inside your project so as to use project-specific relative path and avoid adding system specific absolute path.
There is no proper way to add multiple jar libraries from the folder using Maven.
However for my particular case, I had a lib folder with more than 100 proprietary jar files which I had to add somehow.
add the dependency as like as the libraries on a maven repository.
I just added the existing framework folder manually into the project navigator.
(optional) Drag and drop the added
framework to the "Frameworks" group.
Right-click on the project folder you wish to add the framework to.
Select 'Add Files to "YourProjectName"'
Select "Add"
Click on + Button and add your Frameworks
Follow below 5 steps to add framework in your project.
(optional) Drag and drop the added
framework to the "Frameworks" group.
In your local clone of your forked repository, you can add the original GitHub repository as a "remote".
Before you can sync, you need to add a remote that points to the upstream repository.
Add the parent as a remote repository, git remote add upstream <repo-location>
Since November 2013 there has been an unofficial feature request open with GitHub to ask them to add a very simple and intuitive method to keep a local fork in sync with upstream:
Note: Since the feature request is unofficial it is also advisable to contact support@github.com to add your support for a feature like this to be implemented.
Add the "upstream" to your cloned repository ("origin"):
[code snippet]
You can, however, ask support@github.com to add your vote for that.
In the first case where you haven't committed anything to the branch on your fork it is safe to push forcefully (Add the -f switch; i.e.
Use this if you dont want to add another remote endpoint to your project, as other solutions posted here.
Android Studio now has learned to work with GitHub fork repositories (you don't even have to add "upstream" remote repository by console command).
I would like to add on to [@krlmlr's (hyper-link)] [answer (hyper-link)].
You may think that Base64's padding = character may be bad for URL's param value, however it seems not - see this discussion: [http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-bugs-list/2007-February/037195.html (hyper-link)] .
However you shouldn't put encoded data without param name because encoded string with padding will be interpreted as param key with empty value.
If I understand the question correctly, you simply want to "undo" the git add that was done for that file.
This command is basically the reverse of git add -p: it will only remove the selected changes from the staging area.
I find it extremely useful in "unadding" something that I added by mistake.
If you have a modification in filename.txt , you added it to stage by mistake and you want to remove the file from staging but you don't want to lose the changes.
git add .
git add path/to/file1 path/to/file2
you simply want to "undo" the git add that was done for that file.
I can highly recommend [this (hyper-link)] post explaining the differences between git revert, git restore and git reset and also additional parameters for git restore.
As indicated in the comments and by @Alexander, currently the best method to add the values of a Series as a new column of a DataFrame could be using [assign (hyper-link)]:
This is the simple way of adding a new column: df['e'] = e
Let me just add that, just like for [hum3 (hyper-link)], .loc didn't solve the SettingWithCopyWarning and I had to resort to df.insert().
I would like to add a new column, 'e', to the existing data frame and do not change anything in the data frame.
As of Pandas 0.16.0, you can also use [assign (hyper-link)], which assigns new columns to a DataFrame and returns a new object (a copy) with all the original columns in addition to the new ones.
If you get the SettingWithCopyWarning, an easy fix is to copy the DataFrame you are trying to add a column to.
To add a new column, 'e', to the existing data frame
I was looking for a general way of adding a column of numpy.nans to a dataframe without getting the dumb SettingWithCopyWarning.
For example, this dataframe can have a column added to it by simply using the [] accessor
If the column you are trying to add is a series variable then just :
Therefore, if you want to add the column e at the end of a data frame called df, you can use:
this is a special case of adding a new column to a pandas dataframe.
Here, I am adding a new feature/column based on an existing column data of the dataframe.
so, let our dataFrame has columns 'feature_1', 'feature_2', 'probability_score' and we have to add a new_column 'predicted_class' based on data in column 'probability_score'.
Whenever you add a Series object as new column to an existing DF, you need to make sure that they both have the same index.
Then add it to the DF
ssh-add and ssh (assuming you are using the openssh implementations) require an environment variable to know how to talk to the ssh agent.
If you started the agent in a different command prompt window to the one you're using now, or if you started it incorrectly, neither ssh-add nor ssh will see that environment variable set (because the environment variable is set locally to the command prompt it's set in).
Add a file called .bashrc to your home folder.
If it isn't, include a full path after the ssh-add command.
Add to or create file ~/.ssh/config with the contents
[code snippet]
In the original tutorial the ForwardAgent param is Yes, but it's a typo.
Update: A better solution on Mac is to add your key to the Mac OS Keychain:
Then use ssh-add as you normally would.
and then do ssh-add.
You might need to start ssh-agent before you run the ssh-add command:
[ssh-add complains: Could not open a connection to your authentication agent (hyper-link)]
Also, whenever I use ssh-add, I always add private keys to it.
3) Right now, you can run the following command : ssh-add -l
This will set the environment variables that are needed for ssh-add to work.
on running the command while generating and adding SSH key: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.
One thing I came across was that eval did not work for me using Cygwin, what worked for me was ssh-agent ssh-add id_rsa.
Just add this to /etc/profile.d/ssh-helper.sh:
The ssh-add does not work from command line with this type of agent
You need to add the private key via pageant UI window which you can get by doublicking the Pageant icon in the taskbar (once it is started).
Before you add the key to Pageant you need to convert it to PPK format.
The idea of this problem is that ssh-add needs SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID environment variables to be set with current ssh-agent sock file path and pid number.
Now when environment variables (SSH_AUTH_SOCK and SSH_AGENT_PID) are set for current console session run your ssh-add command and it will not fail again to connect ssh agent.
If you using Cygwin terminal with BASH, add the following to $HOME/.bashrc file.
This only starts ssh-agent once in the first Bash terminal and adds the keys to ssh-agent.
DONT FORGET to add your correct keys in "ssh-add" command.
I was having trouble with PoSH and the Start-SshAgent / Add-SshKey commands, so I whipped up a quick script that might help some folks out.
This is intended to be added to your PowerShell profile which you can edit by executing notepad $PROFILE
Added ssh key generated in step 2 to ssh agent
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
For bash built into Windows 10, I added this to .bash_profile:
Add the below function to your Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
For this to work you need to have ssh-add and ssh-agent in your path environment variable.
I had created my ssh keys in /root/.ssh folder, So even when I ran ssh-add as root, it couldn't do its work and keep saying
Note: For accessing your repository on git add your git password when you are creating ssh keys with ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your git email here".
For window users, I found cmd eval `ssh-agent -s` didn't work, but using git bash worked a treat eval `ssh-agent -s`; ssh-add KEY_LOCATION, and making sure the windows service "OpenSSH Key Management" wasn't disabled
You need neither ssh-agent nor ssh-add when you use a passwordless private key, see [Add private key to ssh-agent in docker file (hyper-link)].
If you cherry pick what to commit using git add --patch (or git add -p), --staged will return what is staged.
This shows what has been added to the index and staged for a commit.
If you have more than one file with staged changes, it may more practical to use git add -i, then select 6: diff, and finally pick the file(s) you are interested in.
(meaning you need to have staged -- git add -- some changes.
The  command compares your staged($ git add fileName) changes to your last commit.
If you’ve staged all of your changes($ git add fileName), git diff will give you no output.
Also, if you stage a file($ git add fileName) and then edit it, you can use git diff to see the changes in the file that are staged and the changes that are unstaged.
For example, to have the visual diff tool launch without asking whether to do it for each file, add the -y option (I think usually you'll want this!!
By default git diff is used to show the changes which is not added to the list of git updated files.
But if you want to show the changes which is added or stagged then you need to provide extra options that will let git know that you are interested in stagged or added files diff .
Once you added the files , you can't use default of 'git diff' .You have to do like this:-
It acts like git add -p on steroids, because you can easily stage or unstage hunks (or even single lines of code) with editor commands.
IIRC, simply using "Add as library" isn't enough for it to compile with the project.
Check [Intellij's help (hyper-link)] about adding libraries to a project
On the Dependencies tab, click add and select Library.
In the Choose Libraries dialog, select one or more libraries and click Add Selected.
If the library doesn't show up in the dialog, add it in the Libraries settings, right below Modules.
You shouldn't need to add compile files() anymore, and the library should be properly added to your project.
Right click it and hit 'Add as library'
I think the 'Add as library' step was the one I'd previously missed, and it didn't work until I cleaned it either.
[Edit - added the build.gradle step which is also necessary as others have pointed out]
Add jar as library (drag jar to libs, right click add as lib)
Add compile statement to build.grade
Here are the instructions for adding a local jar file as a library to a module:
In the build.gradle file add the following so that your dependencies closure has:
[code snippet]
Select your local jar and add it to the project.
Add .jar files to libs folder.
Then add .jar files to app's build.gradle dependency.
Add below dependency in your build.gradle file.
Add the following:
[code snippet]
This will allow support for two different ways of adding dependencies.
The compile 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.3' (as mentioned by @saneryee) it is another recommended way to add dependencies that are in a central remote repository and not in our /libs "local repository".
Select Dependencies Tab, add the file by using +
In my case the added library missed some dependencies, but unfortunately Android Studio (0.8.14) has kept this as a secret.
I just added the missing libraries and used the default dependency configuration in the app build.gradle file, like this
I manage to get it working this way: put android-support-v13.jar into 'libs' directory, then F4 on my project and add File dependency where I pointed android-support-v13.jar.
Like many before pointed out you shall add
Add your .jar file.
Right-click on it and you will find add .jar as a dependency.
You can find the dependencies added to your build.gradle file.
I made it work by just adding one line to build.gradle:
Copy the .jar file to clipboard then add it to libs folder.
then right click on the .jar file and click add as a library then choose a module then ok. 
You can see the .jar file in build.gradle file within dependencies block.
Second way is that: We can add a .jar file to a module by importing this .jar file as a .jar module then add this module to any module we want.
Then CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+S --> project sturure -->choose the module you want ato add a jar -->Dependencendies --> Module Dependency.
Add the library jar to your libs folder -> right click the library -> click add as a library -> it asks you for the project to add it for -> select your project-> click ok
The following line is automatically added to build.gradle
Download & Copy Your .jar file in libs folder then adding these line to build.gradle:
Added the libs folder at the level of app.
Added all the jars in this project.
right click on the selected items, and say add library
And after adding the jar's as per the steps stated above, the build.gradle got the entries for the new added jar's, itself.
Gradle handles these things we only need to add Gradle dependencies, Gradle downloads it and puts in gradle cache.
We need to add dependencies as:
thats it
However we can also download jar & add that as library but the best practice is to add Gradle dependencies.
3) In Android Studio, go to File -> Project Structure -> Dependencies -> Add -> File Dependency and navigate to your jar file, which should be under 'src/your_libs'
Then add this line of code in the app's gradle file:
Step 3 : Now you should see the jar file under libs folder, right click on the jar file and select "Add as library", Click OK for prompt "Create Library"
Step 4 : Now this jar has been added.
In your build.gradle add dependency like this,
Add your jar package name (as an example compile 'com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:3.3.1') into gradle build script under build.gradle(Module:app).
Then select "Add > 1 Library dependency"
Easy steps to add external library in Android Studio
Right click the desired module where you would like to add the external library, then select New > Directroy and name it as
  'libs'
Right click the blah_blah.jar, Then select 'Add as Library..'.
This will automatically add and entry in build.gradle as compile
  files('libs/blah_blah.jar') and sync the gradle.
It will automatically add the dependencies in the gradle file (Module:app).
In Android Studio, right click on the jar file, and select Add as a Library... from the popup menu.
Open up your java file, and add the import statement there:
To not add a newline to the end of the string:
To not add a space between all the function arguments you want to print:
If you are having trouble with buffering, you can flush the output by adding flush=True keyword argument:
If you wanted to use this in Python 2.x just add this at the start of your file:
Note the parameterless "print" that adds the final newline:
You can just add , at the end of the print function, so it won't print on a new line.
First, to erase to the left, it backs up the cursor over the three numeric characters with the '\b\b\b' as ⌫⌫⌫ rubout and drops a new period to add to the progress bar length.
Then the code loops through its mundane time intensive operations while it prints nothing more until it returns here to wipe three digits back, add a period and write three digits again, incremented.
Just add a comma after printing "hi".
Adding a trailing comma says: after print, ignore \n.
But if you want to print all these output in a straight line then all you should do is add an attribute called    end() to print.
And not just a space, you can also add other endings for your output.
I was able to get divider lines nicely after importing this file in my project and add it as an item decoration to the recycler view.
I'm sure additional styling can be done, but it's a starting point.
An ItemDecoration allows the application to add a special drawing and layout offset to specific item views from the adapter's data set.
All ItemDecorations are drawn in the order they were added, before the item views (in onDraw()) and after the items (in onDrawOver(Canvas, RecyclerView, RecyclerView.State).
Extend ItemDecoration, add a custom constructor which takes space height as a parameter and override the getItemOffsets() method:
If you don't want to insert space below the last item, add the following condition:
To use your new class, add VerticalSpaceItemDecoration or DividerSpaceItemDecoration to RecyclerView, for example in your fragment's onCreateView() method:
This doesn't actually solve the problem, but as a temporary workaround, you can set the [useCompatPadding (hyper-link)] property on the card in your XML layout to make it measure the same as it does on pre-Lollipop versions.
Add a margin to your view.
If you just want to add equal spacing and want to do it in XML, just set padding to your RecyclerView and equal amount of layoutMargin to the item you inflate into your RecyclerView, and let the background color determine the spacing color.
Taken from a Google search, add this [ItemDecoration (hyper-link)] to your RecyclerView:
To add divider to each item:
You just need to add padding property to your item view
For those who are looking just for spaces between items in the RecyclerView, see my approach where you get equal spaces between all items, except in the first and last items where I gave a bigger padding.
I only apply padding to left/right in a horizontal LayoutManager and to top/bottom in a vertical LayoutManager.
If you want to add the same space for items, the simplest way is to add top+left padding for RecycleView and right+bottom margins to card items.
Here's my lazy approach, but it works:
wrap the CardView in a layout and set a padding/margin on the parent layout to mimic the divider, and force the normal divider to null.
In the code below I have a RecyclerView comprised of CardView objects within a LinearLayout with a "padding" that will put some space between items.
And here is what each item looks like (and it shows as divided due to the android:padding in the LinearLayout that surrounds everything) in another file: cards_layout.xml
Here is a simple hack to add a divider
Just add a background to the layout of your recycler item as follows
[code snippet]
1) Add this class to your project:
2) Add the decorator to your RecylerView:
If you add both top and bottom margins, they will appear both added between items and they will be too large.
If you only add either, there will be no margin either at the top or the bottom of the whole list.
If you add half of the distance at the top, half at the bottom, the outer margins will be too small.
Since there is no right way to implement this yet properly using [Material Design (hyper-link)], I just did the following trick to add a divider on the list item directly:
I have added a line in a list item like below:
Add dependency:
Add to your recyclerview:
Just add
Also you may need to add the dependency
implementation 'com.android.support:recyclerview-v7:28.0.0'
For customizing it a little bit you can add a custom drawable:
You can easily add it programmatically.
We can easily add an effect, like a divider.
And another is by adding a view as a divider to a list_item_layout of a recycler view.
I have a very simple way of adding a divider in RecyclerView.
Use a custom adapter to modify the recycler view layout and then along with the recycler view items add LinearLayout with a background color (which will be the divider color) and add a height of 1 dp (or as per your requirement) and width to match parent.
This will add space in every item's top and bottom (or left and right).
If anyone is looking to only add, say, 10 dp spacing between items, you can do so by setting a drawable to DividerItemDecoration:
Just add this line after init in the recycler view object.
Add this in your drawable: line_divider.xml
After creating an adapter instance, you can simply add a divider simply by using:
The way how I'm handling the Divider view and also Divider Insets is by adding a RecyclerView extension.
Add a new extension file by naming View or RecyclerView:
and add the setDivider extension method inside the RecyclerViewExtension.kt file.
As an alternative to adding top spacing to the Rect, you could also add bottom spacing, but the logic related to getting the last item of the adapter is more complex, so this might be slightly better.
:: doesn't work inline; add & character:
your commands here      & ::  commenttttttttttt
And as said in the first comment: you can add info to any line you feel the need to
To do it on the same line as a command, you must add an ampersand:
This is an old topic and I'd like to add my understanding here to expand the knowledge of this interesting topic.
You can add comments to the end of a batch file with this syntax:
First check if the table/column(id/name) combination exists in dbo.syscolumns (an internal SQL Server table that contains field definitions), and if not issue the appropriate ALTER TABLE query to add it.
Here is a simple script I use to manage addition of columns in the database:
In this example, the Name is the ColumnName to be added and Object_Id is the TableName
Another contribute is the following sample that add the column if not exist.
You can add as many more properties as you like simply by using the dot notation:
You can add to it at any point.
I know that the question is answered perfectly, but I also found another way to add new properties and wanted to share it with you:
in addition to all the previous answers, and in case you're wondering how we're going to write dynamic property names in the Future using Computed Property Names ( ECMAScript 6 ), here's how:
Just an addition to abeing's answer above.
reference: [http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#constructorpatternjavascript (hyper-link)]
You can add properties dynamically using some of the options below:
So, you can add a property with corresponding value.
Let's say we want to add a Language with a default value of EN.
Be careful while adding a property to the existing object using .
(.dot) method of adding a property to the object should only be used if you know the 'key' beforehand otherwise use the [bracket] method.
So the best way of adding dynamically created property is the [bracket] method.
It can be useful if mixed new property add in runtime:
obj[field] = 123: adds a [computed property name (hyper-link)] to obj
for that we have to use Object class's defineProperty() method which allows to add dynamic property into objects.
code for adding property dynamically to the object.
If you wish to force a "," separator regardless of culture (for example in a trace or log message), the following code will work and has the added benefit of telling the next guy who stumbles across it exactly what you are doing.
You could also add error checking for negative decimal place values.
With the introduction of C# 6.0 and specifically the String Interpolation there's a neater and, IMO safer, way to do what has been asked to add commas in thousands place for a number:
Adding line breaks to your Git commit
You can use the same shortcut, which is used to add/remove (parts of) components ({isVisible && <SomeComponent />}).
Let’s say we want to add a custom property (using aria-* or data-*) if a condition is true:
Let’s say we want to add a style property if a condition is true:
But it can be improved in order to avoid adding one if block for each conditional prop.
You'll have a clean and readable syntax, even with many conditional props: every new prop just add a line of code inside the object declaration.
Too many times we solve problems for our ego, adding complexity where it's not required.
You can add read-only attributes conditionally using ternary operator and boolean values.
So rather than add each item inside a loop it is better to collect items within a loop and append it once it's completed.
This requires that append be called into for each element and a reflow gets triggered when each is added individually.
That's what I did with two-dimensional arrays: The first column is item i, add to innerHTML of the <option>.
The second column is record_id i, add to the value of the <option>:
Then to add an option just do the following:
Deal with multiple property while adding more options
Using map() to add new Options.
In pure JS adding next option to select is easier and more direct
Ideally your .gitignore should prevent the untracked (and ignored) files from being shown in status, added using git add etc.
You can do git add -u so that it will stage the modified and deleted files.
Note that if you have Git of version before 2.0 and used git add ., then you would need to use git add -u .
(See "[Difference of “git add -A” and “git add .” (hyper-link)]").
git add -u
Use interactive mode (git add -i), select update (type 2 or u in What now> prompt), select all(type * in Update>> prompt), exit interactive mode(type 7 or q in What now> prompt) .
In the Update>> prompt, type * to add all the files of the above list to the staging area(you could well add individual files too by providing the comma separated numbers),
At this point of time, all of your modified files have been added to the staging area and you can verify the status by typing 1 or s in the What now> prompt(or just exit the interactive mode by typing q or 7 and run the usual git status command),
then you can use git add -A
Instead of removing and re-adding, you can do this:
I don't have enough reputation to comment answer of @user1615903, so add this as answer: 
"git remote remove" does not exist, should use "rm" instead of "remove".
To add a remote:
you can try this out,if you want to remove origin and then add it:
For adding new origin
This will add new remote "origin"
Add new remote origin by running command
However, in this case I'd probably space it out with padding, like this:
Then just add a backslash \ to the beginning.
b) Add one white-space (e. g., space) character after the escape sequence:
All refs under refs/tags are pushed, in addition to refspecs explicitly
  listed on the command line.
Git 2.4 [has added (hyper-link)] the push.followTags option to turn that flag on by default which you can set with:
or by adding followTags = true to the [push] section of your ~/.gitconfig file.
[http://wptheming.com/2011/04/add-remove-github-tags (hyper-link)]
One sample of Git Extensions and Source tree has been added.
Select the commit on which you want to add tag.
This popup will be opened, add the tag name and select "push tag to origin", based on your requirements.
Next, in ConfigureServices, each type is added to the container according to its named lifetime:
AddSingleton() creates a single instance of the service when it is first requested and reuses that same instance in all the places where that service is needed.
Copy-paste this code and press on the create button in the view and switch between
AddSingleton , AddScoped and AddTransient you will get each time a different result that will might help you understand this.
AddSingleton() - As the name implies, AddSingleton() method creates a
Singleton service.
AddTransient() - This method creates a Transient service.
AddScoped() - This method creates a Scoped service.
You will need to add/modify the files here instead of under aufs/mnt/*.
If you need to do this on a running container you can use docker exec (added in 1.3).
You can just trace the IP address of your local machine using
See also [How can I add a volume to an existing Docker container?
You can then add a new layer consisting of some local files on top of it using the script, saving the whole thing as a new image (i.e.
To add to Martijn’s answer, this is the relevant part of [the source (hyper-link)] (in C, as the range object is written in native code):
If you're wondering why this optimization was added to range.__contains__, and why it wasn't added to xrange.__contains__ in 2.7:
The patch for that issue not only added index and count to 3.2's range, it also re-worked the optimized __contains__ (which shares the same math with index, and is directly used by count).
** [This change (hyper-link)] went in for 3.2 as well, and was not backported to 2.x, because "it's a bugfix that adds new methods".
Adding a remote to repo B that pointed to repo A (git remote add...)
Update: Added --tags as suggested by @jstadler in order to keep tags.
This will appear as a single commit where all files of Rails master branch are added into "rails" directory.
Add 'rails/' from commit <rev>
But you might have to install it by yourself in addition to git.
When you want to merge three or more projects in a single commit, do the steps as described in the other answers (remote add -f, merge).
Add all files (git add -A) and commit them (message "Merging projects A, B, C, and D into one project).
If you have more than three branches, just add as much head^n..head as you have branches.
Do not always add that, because this might cause a rewrite of some commits.
Then, I added the development history of my-plugin into the main-project history, and merged the two trees together.
Therefore, I added a || true so that git filter-branch would not abort.
Add your local copy of the my-plugin repository (with its history modified) as a remote of main-project with:
If you are using one of these versions, just omit the option: the error message that --allow-unrelated-histories prevents was also added in 2.9.0.
In my case, I also added a deprecation notice to the real my-plugin repository after the merge was complete and pushed.
git remote add origin Project B
git add *
In addition to all the answers using remote add -> fetch -> merge strategy: if you want to preserve tags from the other repository but don't want to spill them all into a common namespace (and possibly get collisions) you might want to change the fetch command a little bit:
Not sure exactly what you mean by "add one and select it", since it will be selected by default anyway.
But, if you were to add more than one, it would make more sense.
The fix was to use standard DOM methods/properites (as the poster original had) to clear rather than jQuery - still using jQuery to add options.
This would be better if the option to be added was already there.
The second line of code will add the Option with the specified value("testValue") and Text("TestText").
Just one line to remove all options from the select tag and after you can add any options then make second line to add options.
I usually add to index changes I don't want to stash and then stash with --keep-index option.
To add to svick's answer, the -m option simply adds a message to your stash, and is entirely optional.
Now it will ask you to add some stash message.
Add understandable message.
You don't need to add these -- they contain per-user settings, and other developers won't want your copy.
So it's better not adding them to version control, leaving VS recreate them so that each developer can have the specific settings they want.
[Adding (and editing) .suo files to source control (hyper-link)]
Don't even think of adding the suo file to source control!
If you'd be adding the suo file in the scc database I don't
  know what other things in the IDE you'd break, but from source control
  point of view you will break web projects scc integration, the Lan vs
  Internet plugin used by different users for VSS access, and you could
  even cause the scc to break completely (VSS database path stored in
  suo file that may be valid for you may not be valid for another user).
No, you should not add them to source control since - as you said - they're user specific.
I'd like to suggest that you add these patterns to the svn:ignore property for 2 reasons:
So when you view status, or commit
files, those files won't clutter the code base and obscure new files you need to add.
Since I found this question/answer through Google in 2011, I thought I'd take a second and add the link for the *.SDF files created by Visual Studio 2010 to the list of files that probably should not be added to version control (the IDE will re-create them).
So for some projects, I prefer to add the '.user' to source control.
Don't add any of those files into version control.
As explained in other answers, both .suo and .user shouldn't be added to source control, since they are user/machine-specific (BTW .suo for newest versions of VS was moved into dedicated temporary directory .vs, which should be kept out of source control completely).
However if your application requires some setup of environment for debugging in VS (such settings are usually kept in .user file), it may be handy to prepare a sample file (naming it like .user.SAMPLE) and add it to source control for references.
To untrack a single file that has already been added/initialized to your repository, i.e., stop tracking the file but not delete it from your system use: git rm --cached filename
To undo git rm --cached filename, use git add filename.
Make sure to commit all your important changes before running git add .
if you've already added a file called test.txt using git-add, then adding test.txt to .gitignore will still cause changes to test.txt to be tracked.
To untrack a file that has already been added/initialized to your repository, ie stop tracking the file but not delete it from your system use: git rm --cached filename
On my server linux server (not true on my local dev mac), directories are ignored as long as I don't add an asterisk:

For Sherlock, maybe you want to delete their test directory, or add the junit.jar file to the classpath.
To import the library using gradle, you can have to add it to the dependencies section of your  build.gradle (the module's one).
Press F4 to show Project Structure, click libraries or Global libraries, and click + to add the JAR file.
Click Modules what you want add jar, select the Dependencies tab, click +, and add Library.
I added the newly imported module as a dependency to my main app module and that fixed the problem.
If you need access to the resources of a library project (as you do with ABS) ensure that you add the library project/module as a "Module Dependency" instead of a "Library".
To add to the answer: If the IDE doesn't show any error, but when you try to compile, you get something like:
After importing the library module, select your project module and add the dependency:
My description is focused on adding external library project by hand via Gradle files (for better understanding the process).
If you want to add a library via Android Studio creator just check [the answer (hyper-link)] below with visual guide (there are some differences between Android Studio 1.0 and those from screenshots, but the process is very similar).
Before you start adding a library to your project by hand, consider adding the external dependency.
Adding the library
Here is the full process of adding external Android library to our project:
Edit settings.gradle by adding your library to include.
In app/build.gradle add our library project as an dependency:
[code snippet]
Additionally you can create a global configuration for your project which will contain SDK versions and build tools version for every module to keep consistency.
Just edit gradle.properties file and add lines:
[code snippet]
Now you can use it in your build.gradle files (in app and libraries modules) like below:
[code snippet]
To resolve this problem, you just need to add the abs resource path to your project build file, just like below:
A simple way to add a JAR file as a library to your Android Studio project:
c) Add to build.gradle:
c) If your project and libraries have a different namespace you have to right click on the library and select option "Add as Library" and select the type what you need.
Additionally, there will be a file called settings.gradle at the root declaring the projects.
There in, right click on it and "Add As Library".
In settings.gradle add

In build.gradle dependencies section, add

Open the build gradle module app file and add your dependency.
Otherwise add repositories in side gradle module app:
Open your build.gradle file and add a new build rule to the dependencies closure.
For example, if you wanted to add Google Play Services, your project's dependencies section would look something like this:
In the Project panel, Control + click the module you want to add the dependency to and select Open Module Settings.
You can then enter more information about the dependency you want to add to your project.
Once you've added your dependency, check your module-level build.gradle file.
Select dependencies, click on +, select library dependencies, and add the previously imported module.
Add the imported module to your project's dependencies.
The library module will be then added to the project's dependencies.
In the project where you want to add external library project,
go to menu File -> New -> *Import new Module**, navigate to the library project which you want to add to your project, select to add 'library' module in your project.
Add in build.gradle(Module :app) in the dependencies section:
*You can add as many libraries (modules) as you want.
And add for
Add the file yourfile.jar:
Add dependencies like as on the selected screen:
Now your library are added.
In summary, if it is like this (local address), they are downloaded and these JAR files are physically in the project:
But, if it is an internet address like this, they are remote libraries (bintray.com jcenter part) and they will be used remotely:
Inside it you can add the library project and synchronise.
Now after synchronising the library it will be added to your project, and you can use its functions and classes in your project.
Go to Project Structure and add Module Dependency:
Just add the library name to the dependencies block of your app's build.gradle file.
Add this in your build gradle file:
You are able to use Gradle dependency configuration[[About] (hyper-link)] to add some dependency into your project
To add the deleted files to the staging area, then commit them
this is similar to git add -u, but also adds new files.
This is roughly the equivalent of hg's addremove command (although the move detection is automatic).
By using git-add with '--all' or '--update' options you may get more than you wanted.
New and/or modified files will also be added to the index.
All files that have been removed from the file system are added to the index as deleted.
None of the flags to git-add will only stage removed files; if all you have modified are deleted files, then you're fine, but otherwise, you need to run git-status and parse the output.
I think grouping of expressions might be a GNU-specific feature, so if you're not using gnutils, you may have to add multiple grep -v lines.
Update: If you only want to add deleted files, try:
it also adds all.
If you want to add it to your .gitconfig do this:
is the best option to add only deleted files.
You can use git add -u <filenames> to stage the deleted files only.
For example, if you deleted the files templates/*.tpl, then use git add -u templates/*.tpl.
Otherwise, the default of git add is to look for the files in the working directory, and if you specify files you've deleted there, it won't find them.
Adding system alias for staging deleted files as command rm-all
git add -u

There are so many useful operators that could be added, this one would be one of them.
Please forgive me for adding yet another version to this already long list.
I also added some argument checking to benefit from early failure with sensible info in case of unexpected input.
You could try converting it into a Arraylist and use the addAll method then convert back to an array.
Just wanted to add, you can use System.arraycopy too:
After that, the added directory will be shown up.
Right click the solution to which you want to add a project.
The application menu will have an add ... item.
Opening that, you find that one of the options is to add an existing project to the solution.

Edit for Anoop:
Steps to add to Visual Studio:
This is not the same thing as adding the existing items because it doesn't make an extra copy in your project's folder structure.
Here is an example of what you can add to a *.csproj file to create the link
Here is the answer to you if you want to add external source codes to your project and don't want to copy over the entire codes.
Then click the "Add", "New Filter", put the name "projA" for projA.
Right-click on the "projA", click "Add", "New Filter", enter name "src"
Right-click on the "projA", click "Add", "New Filter", enter name "includes"
Right-click "projA"/"src", click "Add", "Existing Item", then browse to the /root/projA/src to add all source codes or one by one for the ones you want.
Edit "Additional Include Directories", add your projA/include as such "../projA/includes", relative path.
Therefore, with this new format, your files and folders - added in Explorer or on the command line - will get picked up automatically!
[MSDN: Additions to the csproj format for .NET Core (hyper-link)]
Accessing a pointer with a 64-bit offset requests a dedicated 64-bit register and addressing, while you can use immediate for a 32-bit offset.
Here my guess is contention for integer units: that the popcnt, loop counter, and address calculations can all just barely run at full speed with the 32-bit wide counter, but the 64-bit counter causes contention and pipeline stalls.
13 GB/s has a chain: popcnt-add-popcnt-popcnt → next iteration
15 GB/s has a chain: popcnt-add-popcnt-add → next iteration
The difference between 20 GB/s and 26 GB/s seems to be a minor artifact of the indirect addressing.
I suspect this is because the addressing is offset + register, instead of offset + register + (register<<3).
I get the following results with these additional optimizations:
Ok, I want to provide a small answer to one of the sub-questions that the OP asked that don't seem to be addressed in the existing questions.
How then does the linker know what address to provide to the machine code for the final assembly code?
You may think you can add 24 hours to a date to get tomorrow's date, right?
The syntax is modeled after [MySQL DATE_ADD (hyper-link)] function.
Supports date/time formatting, date math (add/subtract date parts), date compare, date parsing, etc.
I always create 7 functions, to work with date in JS:
addSeconds, addMinutes, addHours, addDays, addWeeks, addMonths, addYears.
You can add or subtract milliseconds by getting the value and instantiating a new date using that value.
Hello back, It's 2020 and I've added some modification hope it will help a lot better now!
You should get the value of the current date to get the date with (ms) and add (30 * 60 *1000) to it.

In this case, it's best to list these additional items in a devDependencies hash.
Then, when the user will use a plugin, he will implicitly require the plugin from the Gruntfile by adding a grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-uglify') line, but it's grunt that the user will call directly.
So if you make a plugin C that adds functionality to library B, then someone making a project A will need to have a dependency on B if they have a dependency on C.
They are not installed (unless npm < 3), they are only checked for.
Example: grunt: your project adds functionality to grunt and can only be used on projects that use grunt.
I'd like to add to the answer my view on these dependencies explanations
Instead you need to consider adding it into peerDependencies or remove it from dependencies.
From the point of view of the plugin, it only adds functions to the host library.
I don't really "need" the host to add a dependency to a plugin, and plugins often don't literally depend on their host.
You can add events to objects when you create them.
If you are adding the same events to multiple objects at different times, creating a named function might be the way to go.
You could simply wrap your event binding call up into a function and then invoke it twice: once on document ready and once after your event that adds the new DOM elements.
Delegated events have the advantage that they can process events from descendant elements that are added to the document at a later time.
For example, if the table exists, but the rows are added dynamically using code, the following will handle it:
In addition to their ability to handle events on descendant elements which are not yet created, another advantage of delegated events is their potential for much lower overhead when many elements must be monitored.
Another solution is to add the listener when creating the element.
Notice the added *.
I was looking a solution to get $.bind and $.unbind working without problems in dynamically added elements.
A solution would be to force the key files to be kept permanently, by adding them in your ~/.ssh/config file:
Additionally if you want to set the key specific to one host, you can do the following in your ~/.ssh/config :
I ended up adding:
(As suggested here: [http://geek.michaelgrace.org/2011/09/permanently-add-ssh-key-ssh-add/ (hyper-link)] )
I tried @Aaron's solution and it didn't quite work for me, because it would re-add my keys every time I opened a new tab in my terminal.
What this does is that it checks the output of ssh-add -l(which lists all keys that have been added) for a specific key and if it doesn't find it, then it adds it with ssh-add.
Since I have a bunch of keys I store the output of ssh-add -l in a variable to improve performance(at least I guess it improves performance :) )
PS: I'm on linux and this code went to my ~/.bashrc file - if you are on Mac OS X, then I assume you should add it to .zshrc or .profile
I solved that problem on Mac OSX (10.10) by using -K option for ssh-add:
For macOS 10.12 and later you need to additionally edit your ssh config as described here: [https://github.com/jirsbek/SSH-keys-in-macOS-Sierra-keychain (hyper-link)]
Adding the following lines in "~/.bashrc" solved the issue for me.
2.add code below to .bash_profile
Just add the keychain, as referenced in Ubuntu Quick Tips
[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/QuickTips (hyper-link)]
Instead of constantly starting up ssh-agent and ssh-add, it is possible to use keychain to manage your ssh keys.
You then should add the following lines to your ${HOME}/.bashrc or /etc/bash.bashrc:
ssh-add would remember one key (personal one) and forget the company one every time.
ssh-add now remembers both keys.
I had the same issue on Ubuntu 16.04: some keys were added permanently, for others I had to execute ssh-add on every session.
I found out that the keys which were added permanently had both private and public key located in ~/.ssh and the keys which were forgotten on every session had only private keys in ~/.ssh dir.
So solution is simple: you should copy both private and public key to ~/.ssh before executing ssh-add.
It will add them all.
Right click the folders/files you want to add and click "Include In Project".
It will recursively add folders/files to the project.
After that, the added directory will be shown up.
Locate the folder you want to add.
I use this to install add-ons like HTML editors and third-party file browsers.
Right click on your project and select "Add->Existing Item".
In the dialog which appears, browse to the root of the directory you want to add.
Type *.cs or *.cpp, whatever the type of files you want to add.
After the search finishes, select all files, click Add and wait for a while...
In Visual Studio, once you are back in the normal view (not Show All Files), the files you added are all listed at the top level of the project.
I did not find a way around it except recreating the directory structure in Solution Explorer and then doing Add Existing Items at the right location.
You can change your project XML to add existing subfolders and structures automatically into your project like "node_modules" from NPM:
A neat trick I discovered is that if you go to "Add existing...", you can drag the folder from the open dialog to your solution.
Right click on solution -> Add -> Existing Website...
Then everything will be added on your solution from folders to files, and files inside those folders.
If however, you want to add a folder tree that isn't too large as a virtual solution directory/directories to match your existing tree structure, do that and and then "add the existing" physical files to the virtual directory/directories.
Git can handle this by auto-converting CRLF line endings into LF when
  you add a file to the index, and vice versa when it checks out code
  onto your filesystem.
Add next to your module gradle (Not the app gradle file):
Adding '$rootProject.projectDir' to the 'dir' path element within my 'allprojects' closure meant each sub-project referenced the same 'libs' directory, and not a version local to that sub-project:

I still want to add something that seems very surprising to me:
This steps will automatically add your dependency to gralde
The best way to do it is to add this in your build.gradle file and hit the sync option
Keep the .jar which need to add as dependency in libs folder.
Be careful if you are using continuous integration, you must add your libraries in the same path on your build server.
For this reason, I'd rather add jar to the local repository and, of course, do the same on the build server.
The solutions added so far are great for the OP, but can't be used with Kotlin DSL without first translating them.
Here's an example of how I added a local .JAR to my build using Kotlin DSL:
You can add jar doing:
Remember that if you got any java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class exception at runtime this means that dependencies in jar not installed for that you have to add all dependecies in parent project.
As [Chris' answer (hyper-link)] says, you can use [update (hyper-link)] to add more than one item.
To add accumulate possibly-floating-point numbers into num.
The function can be extended to add scope for other arithmetic operations also.
If adding more than one option element, I'd recommend performing the append once as opposed to performing an append on each element.
If you're adding options from a collection of items, you can do the following:
You can add option using following syntax, Also you can visit to [way handle option in jQuery (hyper-link)] for more details.
To help performance you should try to only alter the DOM once, even more so if you are adding many options.
Not mentioned in any answer but useful is the case where you want that option to be also selected, you can add:
You will add this code to handle:
You can add options dynamically into dropdown as shown in below example.
always when you are dealing with many options, build a big string and then add it to the 'select' for best performance
This is the way i did it, with a button to add each select tag.

For Internet Explorer 7 we need to add a CSS  expression:
Or, if you don't want to have an extra element in modern browsers and don't mind using Internet Explorer expressions, you can use a pseudo-element and add it to Internet Explorer using a convenient Expression, that runs only once per element, so there won't be any performance issues:
So, adding one inline-block with height: 100% in a block with fixed height would align another inline-block element in it (<img/> in your case) vertically near it.
If you can live with pixel-sized margins, just add font-size: 1px; to the .frame.
I have been playing around with using padding for center alignment.
You will need to define the top level outer-container size, but the inner container should resize, and you can set the padding at different percentage values.
For efficient appending, see [How to add an extra row to a pandas dataframe (hyper-link)] and [Setting With Enlargement (hyper-link)].
Add rows through loc/ix on non existing key index data.
Create a new record (data frame) and add to old_data_frame.
This will take care of adding an item to an empty DataFrame.
In the case of adding a lot of rows to dataframe, I am interested in performance.
So I use addition through the dictionary for myself.
Here is the way to add/append a row in a Pandas DataFrame:
To add raw to existing DataFrame you can use append method.
If you want to add a row at the end, append it as a list:
Before going to add a row, we have to convert the dataframe to a dictionary.
I basically came across this problem to add a new row to an existing DataFrame with a character index (not numeric).
You can use a for loop to iterate through values or can add arrays of values.
Now you might argue that it is not an issue to use loc or append if you're only adding a single row to your DataFrame.
However, people often look to this question to add more than just one row - often the requirement is to iteratively add a row inside a loop using data that comes from a function (see [related question (hyper-link)]).
If you have a data frame df and want to add a list new_list as a new row to df, you can simply do:
If you want to add a new data frame new_df under data frame df, then you can use:
If you always want to add a new row at the end, use this:

Even if you haven't tracked the files so far, Git seems to be able to "know" about them even after you add them to .gitignore.
Without adding another commit to your project, one line will be enough to make .gitignore work as it is supposed to:
When you add something into a .gitignore file, try this:
[code snippet]
If you develop on a daily basis, I advise you to add your habitual ignored files to your ~/.gitignore_global file.
Re-added those files to my project folder
So adding one more line fixed it:
Posting for others who may have added source control AFTER doing a bunch of initial work AND .gitignore isn't working BUT, you might be scared to lose a bunch of work so git rm --cached isn't for you.
!IMPORTANT: This is really because I added git too late to a "project" that is too big and seems to ignore my .gitignore.
So, I needed a list of what I changed since I'd installed the program by adding  > changed.log to either of the following:
PhpStorm (and probably some other IDE users), in my case problem was that I created and added file outside the project, through the finder.
Now do git add, commit, and push.
Make sure whether this is your first commit or earlier these files were add and thus have become cached.
and git add .
and git add .
To add a new remote, use the git remote add command on the terminal, in the directory your repository is stored at.
So basicly, remote add is to add a new one, remote set-url is to update an existing one
below is used to a add a new remote:
When you run git remote add origin git@github.com:User/UserRepo.git, then a new remote created named origin.
If you are going to create a new repository then use git remote add origin git@github.com:User/UserRepo.git to add remote.
git remote add => ADDS a new remote.
The remote name that comes after add is a new remote name that did not exist prior to that command.
git remote add myupstream someurl => myupstream remote name did not exist now creating it with this command.
so the command git remote set-url will only work if you've either cloned the repository or manually added a remote called origin.
you can check remote with command git remote -v it will show remote url after name, or if this command gives error like fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git then the repository not exists, so you have to add origin with command git remote add
1. git remote add
This command is used to add a new remote, you can use this command on the terminal, in the directory of your repository.
The git remote add command takes two arguments:
References from github: [remote add (hyper-link)], [remote set-url (hyper-link)]
1. git remote add origin git@github.com:User/UserRepo.git
This command simply means "you are adding the location of your remote repository where you wish to push/pull your files to/from !!.."
This command means that if at any stage you wish to change the location of your repository(i.e if you made a mistake while adding the remote path using the git add command) the first time, you can easily go back & "reset(update) your current remote repository path" by using the above command.
if you have existing project and you would like to add remote repository url then you need to do following command
if you would like to add readme.md file then you can create it and add it using below command.
Now you completed all local repository process, now how you add remote repository url ?
This is very simple If you have already set a remote origin url then you use set-url command to change that, otherwise simply use add command
If No then use git remote add origin git@github.com:User/UserRepo.git to set new origin for your repo.
and finally use git push -u origin master to push your code to remote and add upstream (tracking) reference to your remote branch.

In addition, by default it doesn't generate a ton a images to be backwards-compatible with every outdated platform.
From an email the developer sent me, they also have plans to add support for generating SVG favicons, as well as [SVG theme-sensitivity (hyper-link)], I think, which is a totally awesome feature.
You don't have to support every range of dates or regions, you can add them as needed.
I'm not sure what I can add to the answers above, but here are a few points from me:
If so, let me introduce you to the [DateTimeOffset (hyper-link)] type, added with .NET 3.5.
For that matter, you need to have user's timezone offset so that you can add this offset to your database's UTC value which will result in user's local time.

I tried to add a return statement right after the finish inside that if block and that fixed the issue.
I thought I'd add this as here as this shows the finish command acted differently then I thought it did and I'd guess there are other people who think the same as I did before I discovered this.
The "Activity has leaked window that was originally added..." error occurs when you try show an alert after the Activity is effectively finished.
Apparently, the message "Activity has leaked window that was originally added" is only an Exception that resulted from whatever the first Exception is.
Try to add dialog at last.
Best solution is just add dialog in try catch and dismiss dialog when exception occur
Additionally this syntax is valid for objects such as Lists or Sets which do not support array indexing, but which do implement the Java Iterable interface.
The [for-each loop (hyper-link)], added in [Java 5 (hyper-link)] (also called the "enhanced for loop"), is equivalent to using a [java.util.Iterator (hyper-link)]--it's syntactic sugar for the same thing.
It adds beauty to your code by removing all the basic looping clutter.
It adds the elements to the end of the array, like in a stack.
The functions just add overhead.
When one wants elements to be added with zero-based element indexing, I guess this will work as well:
While Ben Jackson is correct, I thought I would add how I've been using that solution as well.
Below is a very simple script I use (that I call gitadd) to add all changes except a select few that I keep listed in a file called .gittrackignore (very similar to how .gitignore works).
This project depends on SherlockActionBar, so it needs to be referenced in project.properties, but that messes with the compilation, so now I just type gitadd and add all of the changes to git without having to un-add project.properties every single time.
In .gitignore, add the relative path to the file without leading ./.
So, if your file is at MyProject/MyFolder/myfile.txt, (where .git is also in the MyProject folder), add MyFolder/myfile.txt to your at .gitignore file.
I use git add --patch quite a bit and wanted something like this to avoid having to hit d all the time through the same files.
For the specific case in the question, easiest way would be to add all files with .c extension and leave out everything else:
From [git-scm (hyper-link)] (or/and man git add):
git add <pathspec>…​
Files to add content from.
*.c) can be given to add all matching files.
to add all files (that are not ignored) that are in the main folder.
The above will add all files that are in s(any char)c folder and have Service somewhere in their filename.
That is, you could ask git to add all files that have an extension of .c and .h:
Of course, at some point the cost of coming up with elaborate patterns outweighs the cost of adding files with simpler methods, or even one file at a time.
Use git add -A to add all modified and newly added files at once.
git add .
You can try this: git add * && git reset main/dontcheckmein.txt
We can add all the files and exclude the file which has to be removed by git reset.
After adding all files to the staging area via
[http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#column-selection-addition-deletion (hyper-link)]
I ran into a similar question myself, and just wanted to add what I settled on.
I also needed to re-add multiple column labels, so for a more general case I used the following code:
You can do that after you added the 'n' column into your df as follows.
See [man git-add (hyper-link)]:
If the file is usually ignored, and you force adding it - it can be accidentally ignored again in the future (like when the file is deleted, then a commit is made and the file is re-created.
Another way of achieving it would be to temporary edit the gitignore file, add the file and then revert back the gitignore.
So, in that case, switch from using this style: /ignored_dir/ to this style: /ignored_dir/*, and then add your !
You can't add static methods to a type.
You can only add (pseudo-)instance methods to an instance of a type.
In the case of adding static methods to a type, there is no instance to pass for the first parameter.
If you implement the wrapper, you don't need an extension method since you can just add the method directly.
Maybe you could add a static class with your custom namespace and the same class name:
Can you add static extensions to classes in C#?
It's not necessarily a bad thing as you can add something like this:
If you implement the wrapper, you don't need an extension
  method since you can just add the method directly.
You can always add all of the methods in to the replacement class if you want to have all of them in one place.
*Note Console will have to be added through the namespace that you put it in.
You can add more constants by making that new enum also extend the interface.
Add some more advanced:
But I'll add the mechanics to the discussion.
There is still copy-paste involved for declaring values but the program fails fast if somebody added or modified a value in the base class without updating extending ones.
Based on @Tom Hawtin - tackline answer we add switch support,
Finally the generic ParameterImpl to add some utilities.
This further emphasizes that Java Enum values are not integers such as C's are, for instances: to use a Java Enum as an array index you must explicitly ask for its ordinal() member, to give a java Enum an arbitrary integer value you must add an explicit field for that and reference that named member.
The general rules for adding the template qualifier are mostly similar except they typically involve templated member functions (static or otherwise) of a struct/class that is itself templated, for example:
Additionally there are contexts where typename and template are explicitly disallowed:

Once this line was added, the problem that this thread is about went away.
this happened to me after copy paste another webservice asmx file into an existing webservice, resulting in the same error when trying to debug the recently added service, to be able to debug I had to start without debug, then attach to the process.
When trying to debug an Excel AddIn in VS 2013, after I had tried all Debug settings by disabling DotNet Framework Source Stepping and disabling Symbol Loading, what finally worked for me was changing the Configuration Setting to Release rather than Debug, since the compiler seemed to step over the code and the breakpoints were eventually hit.
In the page where my break-point was not hitting, i selected the folder > add an existing item and then select the page from its save path.
I'd like to add one more thing that can prevent stepping/breaking by not loading the .pdb file, after not finding this in any other forum: if you add a build post-process to add resource meta-data to the DLL (company name, version number, etc), as in "rc.exe my_dll.rc", this may be causing a mis-match between the DLL and the .pdb file.
If you are finding that you are having to build projects in your solution individually in a particular order to get the solution to build because building the solution directly after a clean doesn't work, and then you are finding the problem described in the Question, it is possibly due to the inclusion of some additional projects that have references to incorrect relative paths because they have been added to your solution from a different location.
I created a class and added my designer to it.
My solution was to add this line to my code:
Solution: I deleted the reference and re-added it from the C:\OurCompanyApps\ location.
Then I could step-through the breakpoints I had added in the .dll code.
Open 'Add/Remove Programs' from the old control panel and run a repair on IIS Express Or you might go Control Panel ->> Programs ->> Programs and Features ->> Turn Windows features on or off ->> Internet Information Services and check the parent Internet Information Services folder.

Maybe I can add something new.
It may be possible to add a path to the symbol path list that would load the pdbs from the remote server, but if there is I have not found it yet.
In my case, the problem was that I had added a new project/component, and I forgot to Sign it.
I think your first approach to adding members conditionally is perfectly fine.
It's simple enough to add an undefined check with usage of a for loop with the in operator.
This will give you a single line (not too complex I hope) per member + 1 additional line at the end.
But we can add a bit more sugar, by using the spread operator, and logical AND short circuit evaluation:
UPDATE:
It is even better to follow the approach of Axel Rauschmayer in his blog article about conditionally adding entries inside object literals and arrays ([http://2ality.com/2017/04/conditional-literal-entries.html (hyper-link)]):
I hope this is the much efficient way to add an entry based on the condition.
For more info on how to conditionally add entries inside an object literals.
You can add all your undefined values with no condition and then use JSON.stringify to remove them all :
Conditionally Add a member to an Object
For the sake of completeness you can use [Object.defineProperty() (hyper-link)] if you want to add additional [descriptors (hyper-link)].
Note I purposely added enumerable: true otherwise the property wouldn't appear in the console.log().
The advantage with this approach is that you can also use [Object.defineProperties() (hyper-link)] if you want to add multiple new properties (However, in this way every property will be dependent on the same condition...)

to include public/products/a/b.jpg they wont be detected correctly, even if you add them specifically like this !/public/products, !public/products/*, etc..
The solution is to make sure you add an entry for every path level like this to override them all.
Thus, I additionally use
This is because the line homedir/app1/*
when passed to git add using the above command appears as git add 'homedir/app1/*', and enclosing characters in single quotes ('') preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes, thus preventing aliases (such as homedir) from functioning (see [Bash Single Quotes (hyper-link)]).
Add an additional answer:
The simplest and probably best way is to try adding the files manually (generally this takes precedence over .gitignore-style rules):
You may even want the -N intent to add flag, to suggest you will add them, but not immediately.
Indeed ADD go /usr/local/ will add content of go folder and not the folder itself, you can use Thomasleveil solution or if that did not work for some reason you can change WORKDIR to /usr/local/ then add your directory to it like:
But if you want to add multiple folders, it will be annoying to add them like that, the only solution for now as I see it from my current issue is using COPY .
and I want to add src assets package.json justforfun go so:
In this way you ignore everything, but excluding what you want to be copied or added only from "ignore list".
It is a late answer but adding more ways to do the same covering even more cases.

The .gitignore file is not added to a repository by default.
Use vi or your favorite text editor to create the .gitignore file then issue a git add .gitignore followed by git commit -m "message" .gitignore.
Open it in a text editor and add your rules, then save and close
As simple as things can (sometimes) be: Just add the following into your preferred command line interface (GNU Bash, Git Bash, etc.)
To add additional files to ignore, just call the following command:

Add the contents of your gitignore file.

The easy way that I do it is to go into the terminal and run vim .gitignore and then add the files.

Step 3 (option 2)
Add whatever files apply to your project.
If you are not sure what to add, the best keywords to use in your search engine would be to include your project type and text editor.
For example, if you use [Sublime Text (hyper-link)] you would want to add
And if you are working with a [Cordova (hyper-link)] project in [Dreamweaver (hyper-link)] you would want to add
Now, go to /Developer/Library/Xcode/Project Templates/Application/Cocoa Application/
Add your .gitignore file there.
Then you can open the file and write all the files you don´t want to add on the repository.
Once you have this, you need to add it to your git repository.

If the step 2 dowsn´t work then you should write the hole route of the files that you would like to add.
Open texteditor and add your rules.

you are now in edit mode of the newly created file, but we do not need to add anything now, just press F6 and then press ENTER
Now you have an empty .gitignore file, edit your file in whatever editor you have
that will create a blank .gitignore file where you can edit and add items to ignore
I realize this question is focused on how to "create" the gitignore file, but in case someone is interested in a quick way to add contents to the file once it is created, here is my answer for those trying to "ignore" files that appear in their changes list.
Add your changes to the gitignore file.
To add .gitignore file to your not application you can use the
That will add the node .gitignore to the project.
You can add classes in any format (Array, Object, Argument).
It is not necessary to add an additional library.
If you want to add classes based keys and values in an object you can use the following:
Using my below helper function, allows me to keep the logic separate for future editing, and also gives me multiple ways to add the classes
Just adding, we can filter out empty strings.
I don't think we need to use an external package for just adding multiple classes.
the second and third one in case you need to add or remove classes conditionally.
for more classes adding
In the context where an assignment statement is assigning a value to a shell variable or array index (see Arrays), the ‘+=’ operator can be used to append to or add to the variable's previous value.
It turns out that m() is just a function, reference to which is added to A class dictionary - there's no magic.
Ok, so how to add a method to an existing object?
And if you want to add a method just to a single object, then you have to emulate the machinery yourself, by using types.MethodType:
Especially note how adding the binding function as a class method works, but the referencing scope is incorrect.
Personally, I prefer the external ADDMETHOD function route, as it allows me to dynamically assign new method names within an iterator as well.
I've read that it is possible to add a method to an existing object (e.g.
You'll add a bound object to every instance you do this to.
If you add methods elsewhere, some instances will have those methods and others will not.
Since there are other really good reasons not to do this, you'll additionally give yourself a poor reputation if you do it.
Create a method to add to it:
Now we add the method to the instance.
If we try to add the sample_method in the same way as we might add it to the class, it is unbound from the instance, and doesn't take the implicit self as the first argument.
Although Jasons answer works, it does only work if one wants to add a function to a class.
I find it strange that nobody mentioned that all of the methods listed above creates a cycle reference between the added method and the instance, causing the object to be persistent till garbage collection.
There was an old trick adding a descriptor by extending the class of the object:
This doesn't answer how to add them to your POM, and may be a no brainer, but would just adding the lib dir to your classpath work?
I know that is what I do when I need an external jar that I don't want to add to my Maven repos.
add a Main class
add all the jars to the classpath
add this single dependency to your other projects.
If one developer adds another library, the other developers should not be bothered with manually installing them.
Add the library as a dependency to your project, or (if you added the dependency in the shared-libs project) add shared-libs as dependency to get all libraries at once.
Every time you have a new library, just add a new execution and tell everyone to build the project again (you can improve this process with project hierachies).
This is how we add or install a local jar
Add a dependency entry for each jar file you need, preferably with a perl script or something similar and copy/paste that into your pom file.
Finally I add the following fragment to my pom.xml that allows me to refer to the local repository
and add dependency as usual

Here is the best way, for me, to add code inside word:
I then create additional character styles on top (e.g., "Comment", "String", "Keyword", "Function Name Decl", "Variable Name Decl") which I layer on top; those set the color and whether the text is bold/italic.
Ok, this is weird, but to address the background color issue I paste in the text as normal, select the whole block, click on the highlighter tool to highlight (even if the highlight is set to "No Color"), and then I can style the text block without the background color of the text remaining white.

You would think it appends something after the given element, while it actually adds it to the element.
Consider separating the declaration of your new elements from the action of adding them to your UL..
If you are simply adding text in that li, you can use:
append is used to add an element at the end of the parent div specified in the selector:
prepend is used to add an element at the top/start of the parent div specified in the selector:
Just to add to this thread - if you are moving an existing item you will need to use clone and then true/false on whether you clone/deep-clone the events as well ([https://api.jquery.com/clone/ (hyper-link)]).
Add to this class in the .css file:
or make a new class and add it to the element
To solve this, instead create a new class "top-buffer" that adds the standard margin that you need.
for better responsive you can add margin-top:7% instead of 5px for example :D
I added these classes to my bootstrap stylesheet
If you want to change just on one page, add the following style rule:
p - for classes that set padding
t - for classes that set margin-top or padding-top
b - for classes that set margin-bottom or padding-bottom
l - for classes that set margin-left or padding-left
r - for classes that set margin-right or padding-right
blank - for classes that set a margin or padding on all 4 sides of the element
0 - for classes that eliminate the margin or padding by setting it to 0
1 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * .25
2 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * .5
3 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer
4 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 1.5
5 - (by default) for classes that set the margin or padding to $spacer * 3
This adds 15px  margin to the bottom of row.
In your case, to get margin top, you can add this class to previous .row element
you can add this code :
If you'd require spaces between columns, you can also add the .row-col-spacer class:
There is a trick for adding margin automatically only for the 2nd+ row in the container.
Adding the .container-row-margin to the container, results in:
To add a property to an existing object in JS you could do the following.
A JSON object is simply a javascript object, so with Javascript being a prototype based language, all you have to do is address it using the dot notation.
I want to add something that can be useful.
You can also add new json objects into your json, using the [extend (hyper-link)] function,
Just add the true value as the first parameter (read the documentation for more options).
It also allows you to add nested attributes at once.
Instead they'll be added.
It's allow you to add sub objects:
You can also dynamically add attributes with variables directly in an object literal.
Edit: (I still recommend using images for non-standard fonts as sIFR adds time to a project and can require maintenance).
If you use ASP.NET, it's really easy to generate image based fonts without actually having to install (as in adding to the installed font base) fonts on the server by using:
You can add some fonts via [Google Web Fonts (hyper-link)].
If you have a file of your font, then you will need to add more formats of that font for other browsers.
You add them as libraries to your module.
I put all the JARs I need there, add /lib as a library, and make it part of my module dependencies.
Steps for adding external jars in IntelliJ IDEA:
Just copy-paste the .jar under the "libs" folder (or whole "libs" folder), right click on it and select 'Add as library' option from the list.
Libraries cannot be directly used in any program if not properly added to the project gradle files.
1) First as a convention add a folder names 'libs' under your project src file.
2) then copy or add your library file (eg: .jar file) to the folder named 'libs'
Now right click on the file and select 'add as library'.
Whenever you are adding libraries to a project, make sure that the project supports the library
2- Add compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: '*.jar') to dependencies in build.gradle then all the jars in the libs folder will be included..
3- Right click on libs folder and select 'Add as library' option from the list.
If you are building your project with gradle, you just need to add one line to the dependencies in the build.gradle:
and then add the folder to your root project or module:
Add [border-collapse:collapse (hyper-link)] to your table rule:
I tried adding
In the style section you could add
You can use the ::after selector to add borders to TR :
It is a simple trick that I used in a scenario where I had to put spaces between table-rows so I wasn't able to add a border collapse on the table, the end result :
This thread is a bit old, but I still want to add a little demonstration since it is still not an intuitive problem:
It's unstaged untill it gets added again with git add <file>.
you're unstaging a file that you had just git added for the first time), then the two commands have the same effect, hence the appearance of these being "two ways of doing something".
In the context of this question, of a file just added and not committed yet, there's nothing to worry about.
Let's say you stage a whole directory via git add <folder>, but you want to exclude a file from the staged list (i.e.
When you run git status, you will see that whatever file(s) you reset are unstaged and the rest of the files you added are still in the staged list.
This unstages the file and keeps the changes you did to it, so you can, in turn, change branches if you wanted and git add those files to another branch instead.
You can switch between tabs with :tabn and :tabp,
With :tabe <filepath> you can add a new tab; and with a regular :q or :wq you close a tab.
To add to the args list:
In your example, you could use :argedit test.pl to add test.pl to the args list and edit the file in one step.
Things like :e and :badd will only accept ONE argument, therefore the following will fail
If you want to add multiple files from within vim, use arga[dd]

Note: Git 1.8.2 added the possibility to track branches.
Git 1.8.2 added the possibility to track branches.
I'd like to add an answer here that is really just a conglomerate of other answers, but I think it may be more complete.
Now, all the -b does is add one line in your .gitmodules file.
(instead of that, the branch's commit of each module can be tracked and updated using "git add .
", for example like git add ./SubmoduleTestRepo, and you do not need to change the .gitmodules file each time)

The submodule object is still pointing at a specific commit.
The only thing that the -b option buys you is the ability to add a --remote flag to your update as per Vogella's answer:
[code snippet]
Instead of populating the content of the submodule to the commit pointed to by the submodule, it replaces that commit with the latest commit on the master branch, THEN it populates the submodule with that commit.
git submodule add -b is not some magically way to keep everything up to date with a branch.
It is simply adds information about a branch in the .gitmodules file and gives you the option to update the submodule object to the latest commit of a specified branch before populating it.
After that push within a submodule, don't forget to go back to the parent repo, add, commit and push the new SHA1 for those modified submodules.
[dtmland (hyper-link)] adds [in the comments (hyper-link)]:
In my experience switching branches in the superproject or future checkouts will still cause detached HEADs of submodules regardless if the submodule is properly added and tracked (i.e.
Add line below path = ... and url = ... that says branch = your-branch, for each submodule; save file .gitmodules.
git submodule add -b develop --name branch-name -- [https://branch.git (hyper-link)]
And on function Validator, where return True; is, I also add a JavaScript submit sentence, something similar to this:
Since no parameters can be passed, it is not possible directly, so some people add a variable to tell if validation must be done or not.
Add this jQuery snippet to your code to see result,
but the return false breaks the bubbling of additional click events.
Just add e.preventDefault(); in your method should prevent your page from submitting forms.
You must add type
There is an add in the [Datejs (hyper-link)] library.
It is probably better to make the addHours method immutable by returning a copy of the Date object rather than mutating its parameter.
Another way to handle this is to convert the date to unixtime (epoch), then add the equivalent in (milli)seconds, then convert it back.
This way you can handle day and month transitions, like adding 4 hours to 21, which should result in the next day, 01:00.
will add h hours to this independent of time system peculiarities.
The below code is to add 4 hours to date(example today's date)
It will not cause error if you try to add 4 to 23 (see the [docs (hyper-link)]):
For a simple add/subtract hour/minute function in javascript, try this:
or with parameters to get the time with the added minutes/hours
it will add 2 hours in current time.
Value of d = Sat Jan 30 2021 23:41:43 GMT+0500 (Pakistan Standard Time)
Value of d after adding 2 hours = Sun Jan 31 2021 01:41:43 GMT+0500 (Pakistan Standard Time)
Instead of the AddRange(items) method you would probably want a more descriptive AddPlayers(players) method.
Add, Remove, etc.)
I would add to them the following points.
Additionally it is hard to express, which context you are using.
IList activePlayers), you can use the name of the member (and additionally its comment) to make the context clear.
When there are additional contexts, you just add an additional member.
A warning sign is when you start to add additional attributes to your class (name of the team, coach, etc.).
Is the team a list of players with added behavior
You don't add a letter to "a string's characters", you add a letter to a string.
You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.
Exactly :) you will say footballTeam.Add(john), not footballTeam.List.Add(john).
a Parent should require no characteristic in addition to what completely defines the Child.
You might feel that you want people to be able to only enumerate the set of players, rather than count them, add to them or remove them.
But don't add a constraint that should not exist.
You want to encapsulate all your rules, additional work and internal details inside an appropriate object.
They have direct access to the methods for adding and removing players.
Additional thoughts on encapsulation... You raised the following concern:
You don't want clients calling ateam.Players.Add(...).
You do want them calling ateam.AddPlayer(...).
And your implemention would (possibly amongst other things) call Players.Add(...) internally.
If you add a public API in the future, you will either need to abstract out your API from your implementation (by not exposing your List<T> directly) or violate the guidelines with the possible future pain that entails.
Depends on the context, but since we're using FootballTeam as an example - imagine that you can't add a FootballPlayer if it would cause the team to go over the salary cap.
A possible way of adding that would be something like:
Ah...but you can't override Add because it's not virtual (for performance reasons).
I just wanted to add that Bertrand Meyer, the inventor of Eiffel and design by contract, would have Team inherit from List<Player> without so much as batting an eyelid.
In Eiffel, however, you can modify the names of the public methods, so you can rename Add and Remove to Hire and Fire in your Team.
If an instance of Team is upcast back to List<Player>, the caller will use Add and Remove to modify it, but your virtual methods Hire and Fire will be called.
You could consider a PlayerCollection class which like the Specialized StringCollection offers some other facilities - like validation and checks before objects are added to or removed from the internal store.
A System.List<T> is a mutable ordered collection that supports amortized O(1) operations for adding, inserting, and removing elements, and O(1) operations for retrieving the number of elements or getting and setting element by index.
Is the order in which I add items to the collection important?
For example, you are tired of the absence of the AddRange method in IList<T>:
There are several functions available for formatting numbers, including adding leading zeroes.
Here is another alternative for adding leading to 0s to strings such as [CUSIPs (hyper-link)] which can sometimes look like a number and which many applications such as Excel will corrupt and remove the leading 0s or convert them to scientific notation.
is an easy way to add all files new or modified.
is an easy way to add all files to the index from a single dir, in this case the app dir.
This line will add and commit all changed and added files to repository.
add the following line to file
[code snippet]
it does git add commit and push .
git add -A && git commit -m "this is a great commit"
In the later version of git you can add and commit like this
Additionally you an alias:
I use the following alias for add all and commit:
you can use 
git commit -am "[comment]" // best solution 
or 
git add .
This line will add and commit all changed to repository.
git add .
type git add .
// git add
// git add commit
// git add commit -m
In case someone would like to "add and commit" for a single file, which was my case, I created the script bellow to do just that:
I named it "gitfile.sh" and added it to my $PATH.
Then I can run git add and commit for a single file in one command:
[This Result (hyper-link)]
- Try this: Simple script one command for git add, git commit and git push
git add .
Create an alias in bash:
alias gac="git add -A && git commit -m"
(I chose to call the shortcut 'gac' but you don't have to)
-- or in git speak -- to add, commit, and push) in a single step I generally add something like the following in the root of my project (as a bat file in windows e.g.
Then when I want to add, commit, and push I just type something like git-commit "Added some new stuff" and it all goes to the remote repo.
This won't work because it can only commit changes on tracked files, but it doesn't add new files.
With this all your changes will be added and committed, you can just type gac and you will be prompted to write the commit message
Or you can type your commit message directly gac Hello world, all your changes will be added and your commit message will be Hello world, note that "" are not used
After all, forms are only one way of adding and editing data.
Then, the 'name' field will not be mandatory (due to the blank=True in the model) and the 'address' field will be mandatory (due to the blank=False in the model).
Then, both fields ('name' and 'address') will be mandatory, "since fields defined declaratively are left as-is" ([https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/forms/modelforms/ (hyper-link)]), i.e.
the default for the 'required' attribute of the form field is True and this will require that the fields 'name' and 'address' are filled, even if, in the model, the field has been set to blank=True.
It would be interesting to understand more of the use case; why can't the information be added to the message body?
Modifying, or more correctly, adding additional HTTP headers is a great code debugging tool if nothing else.
Another is to temporarily add HTTP headers reflecting the data and variables being debugged.
I regularly add extra HTTP headers like X-fubar-somevar: or X-testing-someresult: to test things out - and have found a lot of bugs that would have otherwise been very difficult to trace.
Thought I would add this as an answer, for anyone who accidentally mess up like I did!
It't not really an answer to the original question, but a few other posts refer to this post, so thought I would add it here (cause its slightly relevant to the question).
To add more themes on a Mac, put the theme .icls files in
For additional themes I visited https://plugins.jetbrains.com/search?headline=164-theme&tags=Theme I was able to download one of them.
You can't just add an element to an array easily.
Note, however, that you cannot simply add a 401st element by setting terms[400] to a value.
You'd instead need to call Add(), like this:
If you don't know the size of the Array or already have an existing array that you are adding to.
The first is using a generic List<T>:
To do this you will want convert the array to a var termsList = terms.ToList(); and use the Add method.
If you are using .NET 3.5 Array.Add(...);
If you will be adding lots of items then just use a List<T>.
List Add Time: 16
List Add Time: 20
This is not hard if you just want to add an item to the end of the list:
This allows to add more than just one item to the array, or just pass an array as a parameter to join two arrays.
I will add this for a another variant.
To add the list values to string array using C#  without using ToArray() method
Note: don't miss adding 'using System.Linq;' at the begaining of the file.
The databinding operation will add to the statically declared item.
Additionally, if you create a new branch screenshots to store the images you can avoid them being in the master working tree
Padding is achieved using <img width="desired-padding" height="0">.
Even though there is already an accepted answer I would like to add another way to upload images to readme on GitHub.
Create an issue regarding adding images
Add the image by drag and drop or by file chooser
Now add !
Alternatively you can use some image hosting site like imgur and get it's url and add it in your README.md file or you can use some static file hosting too.
Copy the address of the uploaded file
[demo](COPIED ADDRESS)
Much simpler than adding URL
Just upload an image to the same repository,
like:
add this to README
First, create a directory(folder) in the root of your local repo that will contain the screenshots you want added.
Place the  images (JPEG, PNG, GIF,` etc) you want to add into this directory.
Secondly, you need to add a link to each image into your README.
So, if I have images named 1_ArtistsActivity.png and 2_AlbumsActivity.png in my screenshots directory, I will add their links like so:
Add image in repository from upload file option then in README file
Add !
Note: If you add an image to a markdown file, anyone can view the anonymized image URL without authentication, even if the markdown file is in a private repository.
It was added in 3.0 to replace provided and not compile.
In addition, the consumers will immediately fail to compile if any implementation types accidentally leak into the public API.
Then we have the runtimeClasspath and those are all packages that you added using either implementation or runtimeOnly.
All those libraries will be added to the final build file that you deploy on the server.
As you also see in the image, if you want a library to be both used for compilation but you also want it added to the build file, then implementation should be used.
Update: Angular 1.1.5 has added support for a [ternary operator (hyper-link)], so if that construct is more familiar to you:
I'll add to this, because some of these answers seem out of date.
To more specifically address your question, here's how you might generate a list with that:
Ternary operator [has just been (hyper-link)] added to angular parser in 1.1.5.
If you having a common class that is applied to many elements you can create a custom directive that will add that class like ng-show/ng-hide.
This directive will add the class 'active' to the button if it's clicked
EDIT: I would also like to add that codeschool.com has a free course that is sponsored by google on AngularJS that goes over all of this stuff and then some.
Just adding something that worked for me today, after much searching...
You can set the mode to use by adding an additional parameter of true or false to the above command line.
If core.autocrlf is set to true, that means that any time you add a file to the git repo that git thinks is a text file, it will turn all CRLF line endings to just LF before it stores it in the commit.
– crlf -> lf conversion only happens when adding new files, crlf files already existing in the repo aren't affected.
Adding with --renormalize helped, e.g.
git add --renormalize .
" Apply the "clean" process freshly to all tracked files to forcibly
add them again to the index.
This is useful after changing
core.autocrlf configuration or the text attribute in order to correct
files added with wrong CRLF/LF line endings.
So no matter what, we can add "0" to the day or month, and just ask for the last two since those are always the two we want.
so adding .slice(-2) on that gives us the last two characters which is:
so adding .slice(-2) gives us the last two characters, or:
would be similar to an if statement, where if the getDate() returns a value less than 10, then return a '0' + the Date, or else return the date if greater than 10 (since we do not need to add the leading 0).
Edit:
Forgot that getMonth starts with 0, so added the +1 to account for it.
I wrapped the correct answer of this question in a function that can add multiple leading zero's but defaults to adding 1 zero.
Another option, using a built-in function to do the padding (but resulting in quite long code!
will add leading zeros to all lonely, single digits
Add some padding to allow a leading zero - where needed - and concatenate using your delimiter of choice as string.
the [String.prototype.padStart(targetLength[, padString]) (hyper-link)] adds as many as possible padString in the String.prototype target so that the new length of the target is targetLength.
Adding on to @modiX answer, this is what works...DO NOT LEAVE THAT as empty
Git 2.23 adds the new switch subcommand, in an attempt to clear some of the confusion caused by the overloaded usage of checkout (switching branches, restoring files, detaching HEAD, etc.)
Add files to stage & commit your changes to the new branch.
Add something like the following:
1.git remote add ${shortname} ${url}
git remote add ssh://git@192.168.1.100:2224/your_group/your_project.git
Then add all files and commit again.
EDIT: Warning
You should never amend public commits, that you already pushed to public repository, because what amend does is actually removing from history last commit and creating new commit with combined changes from that commit and new added when amending.
Add setHasOptionsMenu(true) method in your Fragment's onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) method.
In the menu.xml you should add all the menu items.
Add setHasOptionsMenu(true) in the onCreate() method to invoke the menu items in your Fragment class.
Menu items can be changed (Add/remove) by overriding onPrepareOptionsMenumethod available in Fragment.
One thing I would add to this and the reason it was not working for me.
If you want to add your menu custom
In your menu folder make a .menu xml file and add this xml
on your onCreate method add setHasOptionMenu()
Here is another hack for adding comments in JSON.
NOTE: You must add the last comment divider line with a valid version, like * in the block.
Edit The initial response was putting the description on the right using # add comments here to wrap it; however, this does not work on Windows, because flags (e.g., npm run myframework -- --myframework-flags) would be ignored.
I changed my response to make it work on all platforms, and added some indents for readability purposes.
It lets you put your NPM scripts into a separate JavaScript file, where you can add comments galore and any other JavaScript logic you need to.
A workaround that works in NPM and Yarn is a comment added as a part of [semantic versioning (hyper-link)]:
sections, the comment annotations can't be added directly above the individual package dependencies inside the configuration object since npm is expecting the key to be the name of an npm package.
I like the annotation/tag style way of adding comments to JSON because the @ symbol stands out from the normal declarations.
Add a single top-level field called // that contains a comment string.
Add multiple top-level fields starting with //, e.g.
Add echo commands to your scripts.
They add a ton of visual noise and IDEs will not syntax highlight them as comments.
If you need progressbar on stderr, just add >&2 at the end of each printf command.
echo progress bar and percentage (\r cleans line and returns to the beginning of the line; -ne makes echo doesn't add newline at the end and parses \r special character)
As there is already a lot of answer here, I want to add some hints about performances and precision.
You can permanently add a path to PATH with the [setx (hyper-link)] command:
To add a directory to PATH using PowerShell, do the following:
In a PowerShell script, you might want to check for the presence of your C:\xampp\php before adding to PATH (in case it has been previously added).
Just supply the directory you wish to add:
Now you want to add directory to it?
Handy if you are already in the directory you want to add to PATH:
For instance, if you already have another version on your path and you want to add different version without making a permanent change on path, you should put the directory at the beginning of the command.
The PATH keyword that follows the SETX defines which set of values should be changed among the System Environment Variables possible values, and the %PATH% (the word PATH surrounded by the percent sign) inside the quotation marks, tells the OS to leave the existing PATH values as they are and add the following path (the one that follows the split sign ';') to the existing values.
Programs and documents can be added to the registry so typing their name without their path in the Start - Run dialog box or shortcut enables Windows to find them.
Don't call SETX %PATH%;xxx - adds the system path into the user path
Don't call SETX %PATH%;xxx /M - adds the user path into the system path
The example detects if the software has already been added to the PATH before attempting to change the value.
Example: C:\Program Files\NonExistSoftware;
This way, my path string length < 1024 :)))
at the end of path string add ;C:\php\
Copy path value only into buffer with framed double quotes!
But if I type "cmd" in the Windows Explorer address bar, it seems to load the PATH from elsewhere, which doesn't have my manual changes.
Add or modify the path lines with the paths you want the computer to access.
Then you can add items like this:
To add elements to the list, use append
array.append ["hello"] to add to it.
Yes you can have multiple expression to add multiple class in ng-class.
You can also add multiple classes, supplied by the user of the element:
Simply adds 'class1 class2 class3' to the div:
Adds 'odd' or 'even' classes to div, depending on the $index:
If you mean the location where you will add it in the layout.
You can define a container like a FrameLayout and add this EditText to it when it is created.
In Android Studio you can add Hint (Place holder) through GUI.
There you can add Hint(Place holder) to EditText
If you're using bash (on a Mac or GNU/Linux distro), add this to your ~/.bashrc
You need to add your new directory to the environment variable PYTHONPATH, separated by a colon from previous contents thereof.
You could add the path via your pythonrc file, which defaults to ~/.pythonrc on linux.
Just to add on awesomo's answer, you can also add that line into your ~/.bash_profile or ~/.profile
Then create a .pth file in that directory containing the path you want to add (create the directory if it doesn't exist).
In the text file that pops up, add this line at the end: 
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:foo/bar
Add an example.pth empty file to this folder.
Add the required path to the file, one per each line.
The site.py script then adds a number of directories, dependent upon the platform, such as /usr/{lib,share}/python<version>/dist-packages, /usr/local/lib/python<version>/dist-packages to the search path and also searches these paths for <package>.pth config files which contain specific additional search paths.
For example easy-install maintains its collection of installed packages which are added to a system specific file e.g on Ubuntu it's /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/easy-install.pth.
This seems to be the way most packages get added to the sys.path as opposed to using the PYTHONPATH.
Note: On OSX there's a special additional search path added by site.py for 'framework builds' (but seems to work for normal command line use of python): /Library/Python/<version>/site-packages (e.g.
So one can add a path configuration file in there containing additional search paths e.g.
create a file called /Library/Python/2.7/site-packages/pip-usr-local.pth which contains /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ and then the system python will add that search path.
I added permanently in Windows Vista, Python 3.5
Adding export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/my/other/path" to the ~/.bashrc might not work if PYTHONPATH does not currently exist (because of the :).
Adding the above to my ~/.bashrc did the trick for me on Ubuntu 16.04
The add a new path to PYTHONPATH is doing in manually by:
adding the path to your ~/.bashrc profile, in terminal by:
This allows you to create a number of additional paths in your site-packages directory.
Doesn't add or remove entire styles, but this could be done with something more elaborate.
One would have to add a local overrides and manipulate that, keeping in mind the "first found" behavior of this code.
(remove the class if it's present, and add it if it's not.)
Adding / removing a class is also less confusing to change / troubleshoot when dealing with layout issues (as opposed to trying to figure out why a particular style disappeared.)
Just like git add, you can unstage files recursively by directory and so forth, so to unstage everything at once, run this from the root directory of your repository:
You can then git add any files that you want to keep tracking.
then add the specific files you want with
This will undo the action of the git add -A.
I removed .git file using rm -rf .git form the local repository and then again did git init and git add and routine commands.
Reset HEAD and add all necessary files to check-in again as below:
[code snippet]
If unwanted files were added to the staging area but not yet committed, then a simple reset will do the job:
Staging any files:
git add .
for all files in the current directory
git add <filename> for specific file
In your git bash terminal after adding files to the staging area you can run a git status and the command is displayed for you above the current staged files:

You can add the Text as a child to a Container that has a BoxDecoration with border property:
A DecoratedBox is what you need to add a border, but I am using a Container for the convenience of adding margin and padding.
You can add a Shadow of a widget
If you want to add border to some text of container then you can easily to do it by applying BoxDecoration to Container.
" once the info is added to the DB, should I delete the tuple?
I worked with a guy who -- in addition to trying to delete objects -- was always writing "reset" methods to clear them out.
You can add with +, but you have to add another tuple.
If you want to add a single element, make it a singleton: t = t + (element,).
You can add a tuple of multiple elements with or without that trailing comma.
The only difference is BUILD_TUPLE_UNPACK vs BINARY_ADD.
The exact performance depends on the Python interpreter implementation, but it's natural to implement BUILD_TUPLE_UNPACK faster than BINARY_ADD because BINARY_ADD is a polymorphic operator, requiring additional type calculation and implicit conversion.
When you add a foreign key constraint to a table using ALTER TABLE, remember to create the required indexes first.
To add a foreign key (grade_id) to an existing table (users), follow the following steps:
alter your table and add an index to it..
[code snippet]
Now add the constraint 
[code snippet]
Note if you don't add an index it wont work.
as a example one table created in charset=utf-8 and other tables is created in CHARSET=latin1 so you want be able add foriegn key to these tables.
use same charset in both tables then you will be able to add foriegn keys.
step 2: add column
step 3: add foreign key to the added column
You can continue to use getApplicationContext(), but before use, you should add this flag: dialog.getWindow().setType(WindowManager.LayoutParams.TYPE_SYSTEM_ALERT), and the error will not show.
Add the following permission to your manifest:

You've correctly identified the problem when you said "... for the AlertDialog() neither getApplicationContext() or getApplication() is acceptable as a Context, as it throws the exception: 'Unable to add window — token null is not for an application'"
Here is how I resolved same error for my application:
Adding the following line after creating the dialog:
Call AddWithoutValidation instead of Add (see [this MSDN link (hyper-link)]).
[AddWithoutValidation as suggested by Robert Levy (hyper-link)] may work, but you can also set the content type when creating the request content itself (note that the code snippet adds application/json in two places-for Accept and Content-Type headers):
try to use TryAddWithoutValidation
.Net will not allow setting this header on the request itself -- even using TryAddWithoutValidation.
If you have imported some changes from another VCS and would like to add tags for major releases of your work, it is useful to be able to specify the date to embed inside of the tag object; such data in the tag object affects, for example, the ordering of tags in the gitweb interface.
If you're using SourceTree to manage your git repositories, you can right-click on any commit and add a tag to it.
So if you want to add tag: 1.0.2 to commit e50f795, just simply do:
Also you add a message at the end, using -m, something like this:
Go to your branch and find the commit you want to add the tag to and click on it:
In the tag name box, add your tag:
Inside your CSS, try adding this at the bottom changing the 320 pixels width for wherever your design starts breaking:
These values are a sizing unit, just like px or em, so they can be used to size other elements as well, such as width, margin, or padding.
Then add something like this to your code to set the base font size.
When I worked this out, I had to get a full-page-width responsive header with some padding few parents up in DOM.
The container width, I had padding: 3em and full width so this got to 100wv - 2 * 3em
100vw means the full width of viewport, and my goal was to establish full-width header with some padding.
Just add the library:
Simply add CSS:
It is triggered using window.addEventListener('resize', resizeFont);.
Trigger the function prior to adding the window resize event listener.
You need to add them all separately.
Alternatively, if you really need to just specify a directory, you can unjar everything into one dir and add that to your classpath.
Yes, you need to add them all separately.
Ref: [http://www.rekk.de/bloggy/2008/add-all-jars-in-a-directory-to-classpath-with-java-se-6-using-wildcards/ (hyper-link)]
Short Form: If your main is within a jar, you'll probably need an additional '-jar pathTo/yourJar/YourJarsName.jar '  explicitly declared to get it working (even though 'YourJarsName.jar' was on the classpath)
(or, expressed to answer the original question that was asked 5 years ago: you don't need to redeclare each jar explicitly, but does seem, even with java6 you need to redeclare your own jar ...)
You can add that line to your console configuration files (e.g., [.bashrc (hyper-link)], or to [.profile (hyper-link)]).
You need to add it to your ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc file.
The files where you add the export command depends on if you are in login-mode or non-login-mode.
So you can just open up this file as root and add whatever you want.
If you use Z shell (zsh), add this line right after the comments in /etc/zsh/zshenv file:
Permanently add to the PATH variable
Perfect for adding system-wide directories like /usr/local/something/bin to PATH variable or defining JAVA_HOME.
Perfect for adding system-wide directories like /usr/local/something/bin to PATH variable or defining JAVA_HOME.
Add script file [name_of_script].sh to the /etc/profile.d folder  with the line:
One way to add a permanent path, which worked for me, is:
It can be directly added by using the following command:
Add this in the ~./bashrc file:
[code snippet]
This adds the current directory (or you can use another directory) to the PATH.
I stumbled across this question yesterday when searching for a way to add a folder containing my own scripts to the PATH - and was surprised to find out that my own ~/.profile file (on [Linux Mint (hyper-link)] 18.1) already contained this:
Add this in the ~/.bashrc file.
Run this command:
[code snippet]
Add your path inside it:
[code snippet]
add export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/dir
Be aware that if you edit file ~/.bashrc as root, your environment variable you added will work only for root
Additional entries：
[code snippet]
Press the Esc key to exit edit mode, and :wq to save the file.
You have a binary you trust and would like to make available across your system, but don't necessarily want the directory in which the binary is to be added to your PATH.
Add the following line at the end of the file and save.
It adds a line to the .bashrc.
That line is going to check if the directory has already been added to the path and append if not.
It's also likely that the contributor(s) who are adding trailing whitespace are unaware that they are doing so.
Added options -U0, and --unidiff-zero respectively to workaround context matching issues, according to [this comment (hyper-link)].
Basically it applies the patch which would be applied with add without whitespace changes.
You will notice that after a git addnw your/file there will still be unstaged changes, it's the whitespaces left.
Review the remaining differences, then add and commit as normal.
Add the following to your .gitconfig:
The trick is to use useradd instead of its interactive wrapper adduser.
You can then add:
To avoid the interactive questions by adduser, you can call it with these parameters:
The --gecos parameter is used to set the additional information.
See [busybox adduser (hyper-link)]
Add this line to your Dockerfile (You can run any linux command this way)
useradd options (see: man useradd):
To set the user password, add -p "$(openssl passwd -1 ubuntu)" to useradd command.
Alternatively add the following lines to your Dockerfile:
Adding user in docker and running your app under that user is very good practice for security point of view.
Reference: [man useradd (hyper-link)]
The RUN line will add the user and group app:
Second command creates demo user and adds him to previously created demo group.
You can't add a list to a set because lists are mutable, meaning that you can change the contents of the list after adding it to the set.
You can however add tuples to the set, because you cannot change the contents of a tuple:
The objects have to be hashable so that finding, adding and removing elements can be done faster than looking at each individual element every time you perform these operations.
edit: If you want to add the list itself and not its members, then you must use a tuple, unfortunately.
You want to add a tuple, not a list:
A tuple is immutable, so it can be added to the set.
The algorithm knew when it was creating a new list that needed to added to the set, but not when it would have finished operating on the list.
As such I found mydict[id(mylist)] = mylist instead of myset.add(mylist) to offer the behaviour I wanted.
To add the elements of a list to a set, use update
s.update(t): return set s with elements added from t
If you instead want to add the entire list as a single element to the set, you can't because lists aren't hashable.
You could instead add a tuple, e.g.
s.add(tuple(l)).
Here is another method to add days on date using dateutil's relativedelta.
If you want add days to date now, you can use this code
GetDate("2019-08-08").time_delta_days({number_of_days}) returns given date + add {number of days} (you can also call: GetDate(timezone.now()).time_delta_days(-1) for yesterday)
If we use date__range then we need to add 1 day to to_date otherwise queryset will be empty.
Please note the key attribute is added to your child component.
When I want to add a certain number of components, I use a helper function.
You'll want to add elements to an array and render the array of elements.
If you need JavaScript code inside your JSX, you add { } and then write your JavaScript code inside these brackets.
I have used concat to add to a string and then just render the JSX content on the element via the jQuery selector:
To add to DSM's answer and building on [this associated question (hyper-link)], I'd split the approach into two cases:
Adding a single column: Just assign empty values to the new columns, e.g.
Adding multiple columns: I'd suggest using the .reindex(columns=[...]) [method of pandas (hyper-link)] to add the new columns to the dataframe's column index.
This also works for adding multiple new rows with .reindex(rows=[...]).
Here is an example adding multiple columns:
@emunsing's [answer (hyper-link)] is really cool for adding multiple columns, but I couldn't get it to work for me in python 2.7.
any header included in the list that is not found already in the dataframe will be added with blank cells below.
then c and d will be added as columns with blank cells
if you want to add column name from a list
If you have an empty dataframe, this solution makes sure that no new row containing only NaN is added.
The below code address the question "How do I add n number of empty columns to my existing dataframe".
In the interest of keeping solutions to similar problems in one place, I am adding it here.
Approach 1 (to create 64 additional columns with column names from 1-64)
Approach 2 (to create 64 additional columns with column names from 1-64)
There is another way to add an new column to an existing dataframe.
1st step, make a new empty data frame (with all the columns in your data frame, plus a new or few columns you want to add) called df_temp
2nd step, combine the df_temp and your data frame.
The reason I was looking for such a solution is simply to add spaces between multiple DFs which have been joined column-wise using the pd.concat function and then written to excel using xlsxwriter.
If you think about .gitignore does not work in a way (so added foo/* folder in it but git status still showing that folder content(s) as modified or something like this), then you can use this command;
If you already have a file checked in, and you want to ignore it, Git
  will not ignore the file if you add a rule later.
So if you want add to ignore some directories in your local repository (which already exist) after editing .gitignore you want to run this on your root dir
Adding **/bin/ to the .gitignore file did the trick for me (Note: bin folder wasn't added to index).
Step 1: Add following content to the file .gitignore.
In addition to @CB Bailey's answer:
I added
Same as the updating existing collection field, [$set (hyper-link)] will add a new fields if the specified field does not exist.
In case you want to add a new_field to all your collection, you have to use empty selector, and set multi flag to true (last param) to update all the documents
Here is a working example adding a published field to the articles collection and setting the field's value to true:
I was looking for the similar query but want to add fields to few documents based on condition.
Example: I want to add a nullable field isDeprecated?
I thought I could highlight one other reason you should choose @classmethod over @staticmethod when you are creating an additional constructor.
In conclusion, @classmethod decorator convert a conventional method to a factory method,Using classmethods makes it possible to add as many alternative constructors as necessary.
It will add to the array; in-place and return itself, so that you can chain other methods.
Push expects a list of items to add to the array.
You can do that by simply adding new elements to the array with the help of the push() method.
Another method is used for appending an element to the beginning of an array is the unshift() function, which adds and returns the new length.
you're adding a few elements to a large array
→ push(...b) is very fast
you're adding many elements to a large array
→ concat is slightly faster than a loop
you're adding many elements to a small array
→ concat is much faster than a loop
And you can add a column like this:
and don't forget to add the rollback option:
use $table->integer('paid')->after('whichever_column'); to add this field after specific column.
You can add new columns within the initial Schema::create method like this:
If you have already created a table you can add additional columns to that table by creating a new migration and using the Schema::table method:
I'll add on to mike3875's answer for future readers using Laravel 5.1 and onward.
This will add the up and down method content automatically:
Similarily, you can use the --create["table_name"] option when creating new migrations which will add more boilerplate to your migrations.
you can simply modify your existing migration file, for example adding a column in your table, and then in your terminal typing :
after that go to your project directory and expand directory database - migration and edit file add_paid_to_users.php, add this code
2018_08_08_093431_add_store_id_to_users_table.php (see the comments)
After that, you can modify your existing migration file (add new , rename or delete columns) then Re-Run your migration file
Although a migration file is best practice as others have mentioned, in a pinch you can also add a column with tinker.
Add column to your migration file and run this command.
And you have to add the column:
Create a migration file using cli command:
php artisan make:migration add_paid_to_users_table --table=users
Add to the function up():
Add to the function down(), this will run in case migration fails for some reasons:
$table->dropColumn('paid');
In case you want to add a column to the table to create a foreign key constraint:
just edit in migration file what you want to add a new column and run -->
Run this command:
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
it will drop the table and re add it updating all the columns adding to the database
Since the interpretation of a relative submodule URL depends on whether or not "remote.origin.url" is configured, explicitly block relative URLs in "git submodule add" when not at the top level of the working tree.
Ideally, the existing repo is moved out to its own directory, free of any parent git modules, committed and pushed, and then added as a submodule like:
So, move, push, git add submodule, is the cleanest option.
For those of you who share my weird fondness of manually editing config files, adding (or modifying) the following would also do the trick.
Note: For either solution, add UITextViewDelegate to the class and set textView.delegate = self to use the text view’s delegate methods.
Then when the user finishes editing the text view and it's resigned as the first responder, if the text view is empty, reset its placeholder by re-adding the placeholder text and setting its color to light gray.
Add your text view programmatically or via Interface Builder, if the last, create the outlet:
Please add the delegate (UITextViewDelegate):
In the viewDidLoad method, do add the following:
Now let me introduce the magic part, add this function:
Now add this function too:
There is no such property in ios to add placeholder directly in TextView rather you can add a label and show/hide on the change in textView.
Swift - I wrote a class that inherited UITextView and I added a UILabel as a subview to act as a placeholder.
To prevent the placeholder being added more than once, a private add() function is added in extension.
I can't add comment because of reputation.
add one more delegate need in @clearlight answer.
And add placeholder property to your already created UITextView
Add animation to show/hide of placeholder.
Just add the extension(s) and you will be able to assign a placeholder string to every UITextView in your project, even in the Interface Builder.
Add your TextView @IBOutlet:
In the viewWillAppear method, do add the following :
Please add the Delegate Using extension (UITextViewDelegate):
Doesn't require any additional subviews or constraints.
It adds a dummy text view underneath the actual text view and shows or hides it depending on the text in the actual text view:
The key here is the willMove(toSuperView:) function as it allows you to setup the view before being added to another view's hierarchy (similar to viewDidLoad/viewWillAppear in ViewControllers)
I needed to add a textView that will get some additional notes on my app.
This additional notes can be created or amended after being saved.
No need to add any third party library.
Add them to .gitignore
To save some time the rules you add to your .gitignore can be used for removing multiple files/folders i.e.
git add .
If you have the entire project locally but forgot to add you git ignore and are now tracking some unnecessary files use this command to remove everything

This file should not be added in .gitignore.
Not supplying a value will remove the parameter, supplying one will add/update the parameter.
No duplicates, each request as unique as you modified it, and due to how this is structured,easy to add more queries dynamicaly from wthin the dom.
if jslint gives you an error add this after the for loop
As an added bonus, if uri is not a string, you won't get errors for trying to call match or replace on something that may not implement those methods.

In addition to the accepted answer from 10 years ago, with more modern Javascript one can use async/await/Promise() or generator function to achieve the correct behavior.
In my opinion, the simpler and most elegant way to add a delay in a loop is like this:
Hey, I know this post is very old, but this code "loops" and adds a delay to it using a recursive method.
Git only records the state of the files when you stage them (with git add) or when you create a commit.
(for example, even if you do git add to stage a new version of the file, that overwrites the previously staged version of that file in the staging area.)
Create a new commit that represents exactly the same state of the project as f414f31, but just adds that on to the history, so you don't lose any history.
The problem is that it's difficult to apply additional constraints to a view that is using autoresizing.
In addition to leadingAnchor, there is also trailingAnchor, topAnchor, and bottomAnchor.
In addition to .leading there is also .trailing, .top, and .bottom.
In addition to .leadingMargin there is also .trailingMargin, .topMargin, and .bottomMargin.
You are adding all defined constraints to self.view which is wrong, as width and height constraint should be added to your newView.
This is one way to adding constraints programmatically
In my opinion xcode playground is the best place for learning adding
  constraints programmatically.
Would like to add some theoretical concept to  Imanou Petit’s answer, so that one can understand how auto layout works.
Add fixed width constraint (consider this constraint as iron rod of fixed width and you have hooked your rubber’s object horizontally with it so rubber’s object don’t shrink or expand)
Do not add any width constraint but add x coordinate constraint to both end of view trailing and leading, these two constraints will expand/shrink your rubber’s object by pulling/pushing it from both end, leading and trailing.
Add fixed height constraint (consider this constraints as iron rod of fixed height and you have hooked your rubber’s object vertically with it so rubber’s object don’t shrink or expand)
Do not add any height constraint but add x coordinate constraint to both end of view top and bottom, these two constraints will expand/shrink your rubber’s object pulling/pushing it from both end, top and bottom.
I was using SequelPro for adding the constraint and it was making the primary key as unsigned by default .
One additional cause of this error is when your tables or columns contain reserved [keywords (hyper-link)]:
You can use [placeholder Attribute (hyper-link)], which doesn't add a default value but might be what you are looking out for :
You can also add the "value" attribute and set that so something like so:
You can also add -nodes (short for no DES) if you don't want to protect your private key with a passphrase.
Add -subj '/CN=localhost' to suppress questions about the contents of the certificate (replace localhost with your desired domain).
I would recommend to add the -sha256 parameter, to use the SHA-2 hash algorithm, because major browsers are considering to show "SHA-1 certificates" as not secure.

Afterwards, select the Permissions tab along the bottom of the editor (Manifest - Application - Permissions - Instrumentation - AndroidManifest.xml), then click Add... a Uses Permission and select the desired permission from the dropdown on the right, or just copy-paste in the necessary one (such as the android.permission.INTERNET permission you required).

But yes, additional thing here is , you can add objects of type X into the list.
Adding object:
List Object = new List();
If we use Object.add(new T()); then it will be correct only if
List Object = new List();
List Object = new List();
If we try to add (new T()) to the above two possibilities it will give an error because T is the superior class of U and V .
we try to add a T object [which is (new T()) ] to List of type U and V .
Due to the extra two possibilities , Java gives you error even if you use the correct possilibity as Java don't know what Object you are referring to .So you can't add objects to List Object = new List(); as there are possibilities that are not valid.
Adding object:
List Object = new List();
we can use Object.add(new T()); only on the below possibilities,
If we Tried to use Object.add(new T()) in

This is because 
We can't add T object[which is new T()] to the  List Object = new List();  because it is an object of type U .
We can't add a T object[which is new T()] to U Object because T is a base class and U is a sub class .
We can't add base class to subclass and that's why error occurs .

Try adding a datetime.datetime to a datetime.timedelta.
If you're after a function that can do this, you can look into using addSecs below:
One little thing, might add clarity to override the default value for seconds
If I have to accept datetime.time objects from an external source, then this seems to be an alternative add_secs_to_time() function:
Consider what would happen if I added 2 hours to 11pm.
This is very bad, which is why you're not allowed to add timedelta objects to time objects.
If it's worth adding another file / dependency to your project, I've just written a tiny little class that extends datetime.time with the ability to do arithmetic.
You cannot simply add number to datetime because it's unclear what unit is used: seconds, hours, weeks...
datetime minus datetime gives timedelta, datetime plus timedelta gives datetime, two datetime objects cannot be added although two timedelta can.
Create timedelta object with how many seconds you want to add and add it to datetime object:
Also please refer:

To customise it further add a couple of lines of custom css to your own custom.css file (adjust padding if needed)
By making the background of the input-group-addon transparent and making the left gradient of the input tag to zero the input will have a seamless appearance.
So to add a user icon, just add &#xe008; to the placeholder attribute, or wherever you want it.
Take a form-control, and add is-valid to its class.
Try to add it to PATH:
UPDATE /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-Base.repo, [base] and [updates] sections
ADD exclude=postgresql*
In your case, the actual path that you need to add to $PATH (or as a command param) is:
Under further test I found out that if you initially add the path to pg_config in the form
I found pg_config in that app's contents and added the dir to $PATH.
When you installed MacPorts, it already added /opt/local/bin to your PATH.
You should add python requirements used in Postgres on Ubuntu.
First add the PostgreSQL bin folder into the path variable like this
Having it in the PATH greatly streamlines the installation, so try running pg_config --version: if it returns an error or an unexpected version number then locate the directory containing the pg_config shipped with the right libpq version (usually /usr/lib/postgresql/X.Y/bin/) and add it to the PATH:
Open your ~/.zshrc file, and add the following line:
Once you do, add the path to Postgres to your .profile file by appending the following:
Only after you added Postgres to your path you can try to install psycopg2 either within a virtual environment (using pip) or into your global site-packages.
If you're trying to add a psycopg2 dependency in your virtual environment that will allow your python project to connect to your docker or kubernetes pod that's running postgresql separately, on your Mac and are not really interested in installing postgresql on your Mac just so that you can get pg_config, here's what you do instead:
This was partly suggested before, adding it here for clarity.
After adding the postgresql package through HomeBrew, you might have to add the openssl path variable -
To add a new element to the end of an Array.
You can add a new item to the end of an array by calling the array’s append method
Alternatively, add a new item to the end of an array with the addition assignment operator (+=)
To add to the end, use the += operator:
If, say, you'd like a convenience function for inserting at the beginning, you could add it to the Array class with an [extension (hyper-link)].
To add them to the front:
To add to the [solutions suggesting append (hyper-link)], it's useful to know that this is an amortised constant time operation in many cases:
We can add objects to Array basically in Two ways
If you want to add two arrays
If the array is NSArray you can use the adding function to add any object at the end of the array, like this:
1) To add single elements to the end of an array, use the append(_:)
2) Add multiple elements at the same time by passing another array or a sequence of any kind to the append(contentsOf:) method
3) To add new elements in the middle of an array by using the insert(_:at:) method for single elements
The normal array wasvar myArray = ["Steve", "Bill", "Linus", "Bret"]
and you want to add "Tim" to the array, then you can use myArray.insert("Tim", at=*index*)so if you want to add it at the back of the array, then you can use myArray.append("Tim", at: 3)
In my case, I had to add a column of ones to a NumPy array
No they do not exist in C# 3.0 and will not be added in 4.0.
It's on the list of feature wants for C# so it may be added at a future date.
It's a little bit different from just syntactic sugar adding a possibility to define an extended property like string Data(this MyClass instance) as an alias for extension method string GetData(this MyClass instance) as it stores data into the class.
Note you will also be able to add static members and operators this way.
As mentioned in [Mads Torgensen podcast (hyper-link)], the extension won't have any state (so it cannot add private instance members to the class) which means you won't be able to add private instance data linked to the instance.
Add an extension property on int and treat the int as IMonoid<int>:
[c# extend class by adding properties (hyper-link)]
As @Psyonity mentioned, you can use the conditionalWeakTable to add properties to existing objects.
It got “caught up”, if you will, in a very exciting debate about the further future of the language, and now we want to make sure we don’t add it in a way that inhibits those future possibilities.
In HTML 5 you can/will be able to add custom attributes.
You can add custom attributes to your elements at will.
You can add, but then you have to write a line of JavaScript code too,
You can easily add a second legend by adding the line:
You can easily get what you want by adding the line in ax:
This would plot nothing but add a label to legend of ax.
Update: add a better version:
Add header if file is being created, otherwise skip it
and to add more rows I can load them in a data frame and append it to the csv like this:
Additionally here is what [RFC2616 (hyper-link)] (HTTP 1.1) has to say in regard to requests:
So keeping these all things in mind, I have added example in github,please have a look into that

PUT  /object/ID Adds an Object with specified ID,  Updates an Object
POST /objects/addList Adds a List or Array of Objects included in body
Then he adds:
3) Network isolation: each process container runs in its own network namespace, with a virtual interface and IP address of its own.
This adds a lot in terms of portability, sharing, versioning and other features.
These images are very easy to port or transfer and since they are in layers, changes in subsequent versions are added in form of layers over previous layers.
Dockers have containers which run these images with execution environment contained, they add changes as new layers providing easy version control.
By the time Ubuntu 16.04 is released in Apr 2016 there will have been additional cool features such as block device support, live-migration support.
I'd step back however and answer it slightly differently, the docker engine itself adds orchestration as one of its extras and this is the disruptive part.
The accepted answer here gave me unpredictable results, sometimes weirdly adding months and years.
The most reliable way I could find was found here
[Add days to Javascript Date object, and also increment month (hyper-link)]
If the times in the Date are not needed, then you can simply use the date object's methods to extract the Month,Year and Day and add "n" number of days to the Day part.
Link Ref : [http://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/add/ (hyper-link)]
For example, add 5 day on today:
You also can add by hour, month...etc.
You can add multiple event handlers to the same object and event in jquery.
This means adding a new one doesn't replace the old ones.
In your example code you are simply adding another click event to the image, not overriding the previous one:
If you want to add a single event and then remove it (without removing any others that might have been added) then you can use event namespacing:
What will happen with this code is that when you click #mydisablebutton, it will add the class disabled to the #myimage element.
This has other benefits by adding styling based on that class as well.
You may be adding the onclick handler as inline markup:
You need to add the original event handler in jquery as well:
All the approaches described did not work for me because I was adding the click event with on() to the document where the element was created at run-time:
If you use $(document).on() to add a listener to a dynamically created element then you may have to use the following to remove it:
exclude-standard
Add the standard git exclusions: .git/info/exclude, .gitignore in each directory, and the user's global exclusion file.
Notice the additional --directory option.

You can make this easier by adding an alias to your ~/.gitconfig file:
If you prefer the more succinct display of Jason Geng's solution, you can add an alias for that like this:
Git continues to track changes in some files which match gitignore patterns, simply because those files were added already.
Assuming there are a few ignore directories, why not use "git status node/logs/" which will tell you what files are to be added?
Untracked files:
  (use "git add ..." to include in what will be committed)
So if anyone else wants to know how to dynamically add to or lookup a {key: 'value'} pair in a JavaScript object, this test should tell you all you might need to know.

It's a sampling profiler, so it adds minimal overhead to your code and gives line-based (not just function-based) timings.
By adding a decorator it will show a tree of time-consuming functions
And in case you want to combine two fields to make it unique on the table, you can achieve this by adding more on the last parameter.
If you're talking about adding multiple images to a single panel, I would use ImageIcons.
You need to add the MapLabel to the top JPanel, and make sure to size them all to the full size of the image (by overriding the GetPreferredSize()).
I can see many answers, not really addressing the three questions of the OP.
Altering the image will come with an additional memory transfer between main memory and GPU memory - which is slow.
For example, if you are developing a game, instead of drawing all the game actors to a BufferedImage and then to a JPanel, it is a lot faster to load all actors as smaller BufferedImages, and draw them one by one in your JPanel code at their proper position - this way there is no additional data transfer between the main memory and GPU memory except of the initial transfer of the images for caching.
Although Java supports a good amount of additional goodies such as buffer chains controlling VolatileImages cached in the GPU memory, there is no need to use any of these since Java 6 which does a reasonably good job without exposing all of these details of GPU acceleration.
3) Do not add.
"Adding" makes sense if the image is part of the layout.
If you prefer brewing a generic Swing component which can show your image, then it is the same story (you may use a JComponent and override its paintComponent method) - and then add this to your layout of GUI components.
This will call add() for each member.
added to them via the add method, using the two methods:
Method 2: Instantiate an ArrayList and add
It doesn't generally matter to the JVM that you've made a subclass and added a constructor to it-- that's a normal, everyday thing to do in an object-oriented language.
For example override HashSet.add()
To avoid that, a copy to HashMap is necessary, new LinkedHashSet(new ArrayList(){{add("xxx);add("yyy");}}).
One set back would be the fact that each of the double brace initiations creates a new class file that adds a whole disk block to the size of our application (or about 1k when compressed).
Use this 1000 times and you are potentially adding a whole MiB to you applicaiton, which may be concerning on an embedded environment.
Loading many classes can add some milliseconds to the start.
While this syntax can be convenient, it also adds a lot of this$0 references as these become nested and it can be difficult to step debug into the initializers unless breakpoints are set on each one.
Any time you find yourself considering double-braced initialization you should re-examine your APIs or [introduce new ones (hyper-link)] to properly address the issue, rather than take advantage of syntactic tricks.
df['Name']='abc' will add the new column and set all rows to that value:
Summing up what the others have suggested, and adding a third way
All these methods allow you to add a new column from a Series as well (just substitute the 'abc' default argument above with the series).
After adding the image, you can use the added image asset in code:
You can either add image by using xml file
For Example, I've to add list.png in drawable folder..
Add xxhdpi,xhdpi,hdpi or mdpi according to your image, like in the image below:[ (hyper-link)]
2)  when you paste image(for eg"mdpi) in drawable folder a popup window  will  appear asking folder name add  -mdpi .
I just added one link that you can check out if have any doubt.
Adding images to the drawable folder is pretty simple.
In Android Studio, you can go through following steps to add an image to drawable folder:
Paste image you want to add
Just copy your images and select drawable then on the option of Paste or press shortcut ctrl v. images are added
Right click on the res folder and add your image as Image Assets in this way.
You can use this syntax to add an index and control the kind of index (HASH or BTREE).
Additionally the index should match the order of the query fields.
Indexes of two types can be added: when you define a primary key, MySQL will take it as index by default.
Above statement adds a primary key, which means that indexed values must be unique and cannot be NULL.
A better option is to add the constraints directly during CREATE TABLE query (assuming you have the information about the tables)
When the HTML element where you add this binding does not have a property with the name used in the binding (checked in this case) and also no Angular component or directive is applied to the same element that has an @Input() checked;, then [xxx]="..." can not be used.

It's also perfect for adding a disabled attribute to a button.
I wanted to have tooltip only for a particular field as added below in code but you want to have tooltip on multiplent you can have an array valdidate using:
If you want to conditionally add any arbitrary attribute, you can use binding to it:
If the value is undefined or null attribute is not added.
If the value is an empty string, attribute is added without the value.
Otherwise attribute is added with a stringified value.
Additionally, note the output from git rm -r --cached some-directory will be something like:

Expanding on the previous answers even further, you can add an id attribute to your footnote's link:
This will add a little ↩ at the end of your footnote's content, which takes your readers back to the line containing the footnote's link.
You need to add to your PYTHONPATH variable instead of Windows PATH variable.
To set the PYTHONPATH permanently, add the line to your autoexec.bat.
I would add a couple of lines to your code that look like this:
Just add the path as C:\Python27 (or wherever you installed python)
EDIT: For those who are not able to get it,
Please add
You can also add a .pth file containing the desired directory in either your c:\PythonX.X folder, or your \site-packages folder, which tends to be my preferred method when I'm developing a Python package.
select Path > Edit > and then add ";C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\"
For anyone trying to achieve this with Python 3.3+, the Windows installer now includes an option to add python.exe to the system search path.
Add the following to the existing variable:
%PY_HOME%;%PY_HOME%\Lib;%PY_HOME%\DLLs;%PY_HOME%\Lib\lib-tk;

In Python 3.4 on windows it worked when I added it to PATH enviroment variable instead of PYTHONPATH.
Like if you have installed Python 3.4 in D:\Programming\Python34 then add this at the end of your PATH environment variable
Adding Python and PythonPath to the Windows environment:
Under 'System Variables':

Add

PY_HOME
[code snippet]
PYTHONPATH
[code snippet]

Append

path
[code snippet]
Maybe a little late, but this is how you add the path to the Windows Environment Variables.
In the end of the line add your instalation folder and the route to 'Scripts' folder.
Python 3 by default will be installed in 
C:\Users\\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python35-32\
So this path has to be added to Path variable in windows environment.
here we go, in "Advanced Options" step you must see an option saying "Add Python to environment variables".
[ (hyper-link)]
When the installation is completed, python environment variables are added and you can easily use python everywhere.
Under environment variables, you should only add it under PATH of "System Variables" and not under "User Variables".
Also, just try to navigate to the path where you got Python installed in your machine and add it to PATH.
This just works and no need to add any other thing in my case.I added just below path and it worked.
You can add it to your repo and reference it with an image tag:
You can't just add .gif to the end of this one and have it work.

in addition to all answers above:
if you want to use a gif for your github repository README.md and don't want to address it from your root directory, it's not enough if you just copy the url of your browser, for example your browser URL is sth like:
but you should open your gif in your github account and right click on it and click copy image address or sth like that which is sth like this:
Add your .gif file to the root of Github repository and push the change.
Add this !
Add in this format !
You can't add items to an array, since it has fixed length.
The name of the file can be added to the string[] in this way,
This is how I add to a string when needed:
Adding a reference to Linq using System.Linq; and use the provided extension method Append: public static IEnumerable<TSource> Append<TSource>(this IEnumerable<TSource> source, TSource element)
Then you need to convert it back to string[] using the .ToArray() method.
When using ECMAScript 6 modules from the browser, use the .js extension in your files and in the script tag add type = "module".
Just add .pack between the name and the extension in the <script> tag in src.
I was also facing the same issue until I added the type="module" to the script.
I would like to point out that as far as client-side (browser) JavaScript is concerned, you can add type="module" to both external as well as internal js scripts.
Add ["type": "module" (hyper-link)] to your [package.json (hyper-link)]
add "type":"module";
Adding the why this occurs and more possible cause.
If you're doing same, simply add a type="module" to your script tag.
use this code it worked well for me:
add this script tag to index.html

If you add the favicon into the root/images folder with the name favicon.ico browser will automatically understand and get it as favicon.I tested and worked.
I used convert -resize 16x16 img.png favicon.ico (on linux konsole) to convert my image, and 
add <link rel="icon" href="images/favicon.ico" type="image/png" sizes="16x16"> to my header and everything work perfect.
If you are doing so from an ASP.NETapp all you need to do is add a ~ to the front of the URL:
But when not running a webserver, the browser itself will not just read the directory looking for additional files, say a favicon.ico, unless it is listed in the html document.
Even though, the favicon.ico file was included, in addition to the images listed above.
Once I added the following line:
However, while it included the favicon.ico image, it did not include a <link> to that file in the code to add to the html document.
I guess that service presumes favicon.ico will automatically be served up and used by all browsers by default, so only the "alternate" versions needed to be explicitly added to the head tag.
You can use NSDate's method - (id)dateByAddingTimeInterval:(NSTimeInterval)seconds where seconds would be 60 * 60 * 24 = 86400
However, if you use it to add a day to the 31st March 2013, it'll return a date that has only 23 hours added to it.
It may well actually have the 24, but using in calculations has only 23:00 hours added.
Similarly, if you blast forward to 28th Oct 2013, the code adds 25 hours resulting in a date time of 2013-10-28 01:00:00.
In order to add a day I was doing the thing at the top, adding the:
Since iOS 8 you can use NSCalendar.dateByAddingUnit
In swift you can make extension to add method in NSDate
In Swift 2.1.1 and xcode 7.1 OSX 10.10.5 ,you can add any number of days forward and backwards using function
Here is a general purpose method which lets you add/subtract any type of unit(Year/Month/Day/Hour/Second etc) in the specified date.
This Date extension also has additional options to change year, month and time:
Usage for only adding a day as asked by OP would then be:

[How do I add 1 day to an NSDate?
Did you init a local Git repository, into which this remote is supposed to be added?
so what i do is after installing git for window [https://windows.github.com/ (hyper-link)] in the environmental variables, add the class path of the git on the "PATH" varaiable.
usually the git will installed on C:/user/"username"/appdata/local/git/bin add this on the PATH in the environmental variable
To fix this add -C <git dir> in the git command you are executing such that
git status will become git -C /dir/to/git status and git add -A will be git -C /dir/to/git -A.
I had this issue and fixed it by adding README.md file

When you already have users and uploads tables and wish to add a new relationship between them.
This migration will take care of adding a new column named user_id to uploads table (referencing id column in users table), PLUS it will also add an index on the new column.
What that means is that we can add foreign key constraints at the database level itself and ensure that database would reject any operation that violates this set referential integrity.
It's not required but you might want to add foreign key(as it's very useful) to the reference that we created above.
To add foreign key to an existing reference, create a new migration to add a foreign key:
This will add a new foreign key to the user_id column of the uploads table.
NOTE: This is in addition to adding a reference so you still need to create a reference first then foreign key (you can choose to create a foreign key in the same migration or a separate migration file).
or add it to one of your Git configuration files manually to turn this functionality on, once you are on a supported version of Git.
Create .gitconfig and add
Add node_modules in a new row inside the .gitignore file.
This makes it safe, for
  example, to add additional fetch refspecs to the origin remote.
(3) In the text file that pops up, under the [core] section, add:

As such, while using jquery adding it and removing it is what makes sense.
No, the IEnumerable doesn't support adding items to it.
When you do operations like .ToList().Add() you are creating a new List<T> and adding a value to that list.
What you can do is use the Add extension method to create a new IEnumerable<T> with the added value.
I contstantly forget that Add is not a typical extension method on IEnumerable<T> because it's one of the first ones that I end up defining.
Not only can you not add items like you state, but if you add an item to a List<T> (or pretty much any other non-read only collection) that you have an existing enumerator for, the enumerator is invalidated (throws InvalidOperationException from then on).
You cannot, because IEnumerable<T> does not necessarily represent a collection to which items can be added.
be able to add items to an IEnumerable.
I will only add that if you are looking to continue coding to an interface that represents a collection and want an add method, you should code to [ICollection (hyper-link)] or [IList (hyper-link)].
As an added bonanza, these interfaces implement IEnumerable.
Have you considered using [ICollection<T> (hyper-link)] or [IList<T> (hyper-link)] interfaces instead, they exist for the very reason that you want to have an Add method on an IEnumerable<T>.
IEnumerable<T> is used to 'mark' a type as being...well, enumerable or just a sequence of items without necessarily making any guarantees of whether the real underlying object supports adding/removing of items.
To add second message you need to -
Among a lot of answers, some of them really valuable and well explained, I would like to add a different point of vue as, to me, the problem has not be well identified.
You are declaring a variable which stores data, you need it to be able to change by adding items to it ?
For this example, just declare IList instead of IEnumerable: IList items = new T[]{new T("msg")}; items.Add(new T("msg2"));
Classes and interfaces that let you add items already exists.
The solution seems to be to add multiple @font-face rules, for example:
Add a new one:
Using the Python you wish to add and pointing to the python which runs your jupiter:
(Note: this answer adds a python2 kernel to a python3-jupyter install, but it's conceptually easy to swap things around.)
Add a python2 kernel

Quit jupyter (or start another shell in the same dir): ctrl-c
Deactivate your python3 venv: deactivate
Create a new venv in the same dir for python2: virtualenv -p python2 .venv2
Activate your python2 venv: .
Adding kernel means you want to use Jupyter Notebook with versions of python which are not showing up in the list.
Install the dependencies with poetry add pandas jupyter ipykernel
With it's api, it becomes drop dead simple to add a month (and lots of other date functionality):
I took a look at the datejs and stripped out the code necessary to add months to a date handling edge cases (leap year, shorter months, etc):
This will add "addMonths()" function to any javascript date object that should handle edge cases.
->>  newDate.addMonths -> mydate.addMonths
If not, delete it and add the real path to the newest Git version.
For additional information, follow instructions at [installing and upgrading Git (hyper-link)].
If you are having issues with it, run Bash as administrator or add the 'git.exe' path to the "allowed apps through controlled folder access".
You can also wrap the view in a FrameLayout, then set the frame's background color and padding to what you want; however, the textview, by default has a 'transparent' background, so you'd need to change the textview's background color too.
Then set the padding on the textview to be the thickness you want for your border.
Basically you have a black square under the view you want to give a border, and then give that view some padding (not margin!)
You can put your view in a vertical LinearLayout (if it isn't already) and then add empty Views above and below it like this:
Just Add this TextView below the text where you want to add the border
Just as @Nic Hubbard said, there is a very easy way to add a border line.
Just to add my solution to the list..
To add a 1dp white border at the bottom only and to have a transparent background you can use the following which is simpler than most answers here.
For the TextView or other view add:
And in the drawable directory add the following XML, called borderbottom.xml
It also allows you to set the border widths independently, and you can also add borders on the left / right sides if you want.
Simplest way to add borders to inset the borders using InsetDrawable,following will show top border only :
Simply add Views at the top and bottom of the View
Add file to res/drawable
Add link on this file to background property
1) fragmentTransaction.addToBackStack(str);
Description - Add this transaction to the back stack.
Description - Replace an existing fragment that was added to a container.
This is essentially the same as calling remove(Fragment) for all currently added fragments that were added with the same containerViewId and then add(int, Fragment, String) with the same arguments given here.
3) fragmentTransaction.add(int containerViewId, Fragment fragment, String tag)
Description - Add a fragment to the activity state.
What does it mean to replace an already existing fragment, and adding
  a fragment to the activity state and adding an activity to the back
  stack ?
So you can add them to embed them in a activity.
For that you need to add that fragment in the stack using addToBackStack() and then commit() to reflect.
findFragmentByTag does this search for tag added by the add/replace
  method or the addToBackStack method ?
If depends upon how you added the tag.
It then just finds a fragment by its tag that you defined before either when inflated from XML or as supplied when added in a transaction.
One more important difference between add and replace is this:
replace removes the existing fragment and adds a new fragment.
Whereas add retains the existing fragments and adds a new fragment that means existing fragment will be active and they wont be in 'paused' state hence when a back button is pressed onCreateView is not called for the existing fragment(the fragment which was there before new fragment was added).
In terms of fragment's life cycle events  onPause, onResume, onCreateView and other life cycle events will be invoked in case of replace but they wont be invoked in case of add.
Edit: One should be careful if she is using some kind of event bus library like [Greenrobot's Eventbus (hyper-link)] and reusing the same fragment to stack the fragment on top of other via  add.
In this scenario, even though you follow the best practice and register the event bus in onResume and unregister in onPause, event bus would still be active in each instance of the added fragment as add fragment wont call either of these fragment life cycle methods.
Basic difference between add() and replace() can be described as:
add() is used for simply adding a fragment to some root element.
replace() behaves similarly but at first it removes previous fragments and then adds next fragment.
We can see the exact difference when we use addToBackStack() together with add() or replace().
When we press back button after in case of add()... onCreateView is never called, but in case of replace(), when we press back button ... oncreateView is called every time.
Example an activity have 2 fragments and we use FragmentManager to replace/add with addToBackstack each fragment to a layout in activity
Use add
Option 1 - "addToBackStack()" is never used
Case 1A - adding, removing, and clicking Back button
Case 1B - adding, replacing, and clicking Back button
Option 2 - "addToBackStack()" is always used
Case 2A - adding, removing, and clicking Back button
Case 2B - adding, replacing, removing, and clicking Back button
Option 3 - "addToBackStack()" is not used always (in the below examples, w/o indicates that it is not used)
Case 3A - adding, removing, and clicking Back button
Case 3B - adding, replacing, removing, and clicking Back button
When We Add First Fragment --> Second Fragment using add() method
When we use add() in fragment
The FragmentManger's function add and replace can be described as these
1. add means it will add the fragment in the fragment back stack and it will show at given frame you are providing
like
getFragmentManager.beginTransaction.add(R.id.contentframe,Fragment1.newInstance(),null)
The Main utility between the two is that when you are back stacking the replace will refresh the fragment but add will not refresh previous fragment.
Here is a picture that shows the difference between add() and replace()
So add() method keeps on adding fragments on top of the previous fragment in FragmentContainer.
While replace() methods clears all the previous Fragment from Containers and then add it in FragmentContainer.
What is addToBackStack
addtoBackStack method can be used with add() and replace methods.
If you want to go back to the previous Fragment then the we use addToBackStack() method in Fragment.
Use the .classList.add() method:
This method is better than overwriting the className property, because it doesn't remove other classes and doesn't add the class if the element already has it.
I will show you three ways to add classes and clarify some benefits of each way.
You can use any given method to add a class to your element, another way to check for, change or remove them.
The className way - Simple way to add a single or multiple classes and remove or change all classes.
The classList way - The way to manipulate classes; add, change or remove a single or multiple classes at the same time.
You need to split the className string into an array, search them through one by one, remove the one you need and add all others back to your element.
The classList way addresses this problem and can be used even if the class was set the className way.
You can add, remove or check for them as you wish!

Are you sure the address the site is being served up as is the same as the certificate?
However Chrome provides no way to import certs into the store so you should add them via IE instead.
On the Mac, you can use the Keychain Access utility to add the self-signed certificate to the System keychain, and Chrome will then accept it.
Now, the following command will add the certificate (where YOUR_FILE is your exported file):
On the site you want to add, right-click the red lock icon in the address bar:[image]

Click the tab labeled Connection, then click Certificate Information
Click the Details tab, the click the button Copy to File....
You can either use one of the methods outlined in the other answers to add the certificate to that store or use:
I had to tweak the Chrome launcher on macosx and added below script.
Double click the newly added certificate.
Type chrome://flags/ in the address bar.
In the address bar, click the little lock with the X.
Be sure you add the certificate to the System keychain, not the login keychain.
After it has been added, double-click it.
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain site.crt
Click the red lock with the cross in your address bar when trying to open your https localhost environment.
Add it to your 'System' keychain (not your 'login' keychain which is selected by default).
For development purposes on Windows you canadd to Chrome shortcut flag --ignore-certificate-errors
Otherwise, setup a TCP tunnel to listen on port 8090 locally and connect to broken-remote-site.com on port 443, ensure you have socat installed and run something like this in a terminal window:
socat tcp-listen:8090,reuseaddr,fork tcp:broken-remote-site.com:443
Then, in my case I have a self hosted web app, so I need to bind certificate with IP address and port, certificate should be on MY store with private key information, so I exported to pfx format.
With mmc console (File/Add or Remove Snap-ins/Certificates/Add/Computert Account/LocalComputer/OK) I imported pfx file in Personal store.
So I used mmc console (File/Add or Remove Snap-ins/Certificates/Add/Computert Account/LocalComputer/OK) I imported rootCA.pem in Trusted Root Certificates Authorities store.
Or with IP address:
With makecert it is not possible add SAN information.
With New-SelfSignedCertificate (Powershell) you could add SAN information, it also works.
Here is how to get the green lock on address bar again.
I had to add subject alt names to the ssl certification for chrome to accept it.
add these files and this example is all in one root directory
For macs only to add trusted certification (required):
I copied /etc/ssl/openssl.conf to a temporary file and then added a line subjectAltName = DNS:*.example.com under [ v3_ca ].
Add a personal certificate and private key for SSL client authentication
  Use the command:
For Fedora, Ubuntu, Linux, if you're getting example.com Not a Certification authority error when adding the certificate using the gui to add a new root authority.
After that, all certs signed by that key with the correct DN will be accepted by chrome without needing to add them independently.
For Firefox, the UI adding an exception certificate does work and it will trust it once you do that.
perhaps you're no adding an extension to the config or command line, such as v3_req
Note, my method bypasses the need for a CSR by just signing the certificates with the authority key and adding details for the dev servers.
Note: As stated by this [answer by kellen (hyper-link)] Chrome does allow you set the purposes for certificates, however IMO it cannot add new purpose for a certificate if the last was not created with such in mind.
Add the CA certificate in the trusted root CA Store.
Add to host.
Add extendedKeyUsage=serverAuth,clientAuth below basicConstraints=CA:FALSE, and make sure you set the "CommonName" to the same as $NAME when it's asking for setup
This added the certificate to my Mac Keychain (ie Keychain.app).
This was totally counterintuitive because SSL was already set to Always Trust, presumably by Safari when the cert was added.
navigate to C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\ but add to the PATH best
Step 4) Add the Cert to Trusted Root Certification Authorities
You can however add color to code samples with the tags below.
To do this just add tags such as these samples to your README.md file:
You can then add color text to the SVG file as usual:
However, it adds it as a new line starting with either - + !
It's worth mentioning that you can add some colour in a README using a placeholder image service.
I added some color to a GitHub markup page using emoji Enicode chars, e.g.
Both "git add *" and "git add SocialApp" called from top directory should add recursively all directories.
Try to call "touch SocialApp/SourceCode/DevTrunk/SocialApp/.temporary" (and check .gitignore) and then try git add again.
When I added the subdirectory it simply added it as a subproject without adding any of the contained files.
I solved the issue by removing the git repository from the subdirectory and then re-adding the folder.
If you want to add a directory and all the files which are located inside it recursively, Go to the directory where the directory you want to add is located.
I am actually used to add all files using the command:
But for some reason, it only adds the folder.
You simply need to specify the folder to add and then use * to add everything that is inside recursively.
Scenario / Solution 2:
By default, git add .
Scenario / Solution 3:
git add --all :/ works smoothly, where git add .
Scenario / Solution 4:
The issue I personally faced was adding Subfolders or Files, which were common between multiple Folders.
So Git was recommending me to add git submodule, which I tried but was a pain.
Finally what worked for me was:

 1. git add one file that's at the last end / level of a Folder.
For example:

git add Folder/Subfolder-L1/Subfolder-L2/Subfolder-L3/...file123.txt

 2. git add --all :/ now.
It'll very swiftly add all the Folders, Subfolders and files.
I just needed to do this, and I found that you can easily add files in subdirectories.
git add --all my/awesome/stuff/ works for me.

Add 9 different size icons:


29pt
29pt*2
29pt*3
40pt*2
40pt*3
57pt
57pt*2
60pt*2
60pt*3.
Add round icons:
In each mipmap folder, add additionally to the ic_launcher.png file also a round version called ic_launcher_round.png with the same size.
I was able to add an app icon to my react-native android project by following [this guy's advice (hyper-link)] and using [Android Asset Studio (hyper-link)]
It generates your assets and it also adds them correctly to your ios and android project:
You can install it using: yarn add @bam.tech/react-native-make in the react-native project
Adds missing icons sizes for iOS
In addition, I recommend this site for generating different sized icons if anybody is interested.
[https://medium.com/bam-tech/add-custom-icons-to-your-react-native-application-f039c244386c (hyper-link)]
If you're using expo just place an 1024 x 1024 png file in your project and 
add an icon property to your app.json i.e.
Warning: it's important to copy the key exactly without adding
newlines or whitespace.
Click your icon at the top right of the GitHub page, go to settings, and add ssh.
Just add this to your Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1:
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa  //adds the identity
This adds your key to your clipboard.
Attach your gesture listener to all the views you add to the main layout;
in addition to the try/catch, include a test for null and return.
onCreateis simply add it to the lowest layout like this:
I've added a [page fling listener (hyper-link)] that adds more checks to ensure that flings meet the threshold for page flings.
I nedded a more generic Class , I took Tomas's class and added an Interface that send events to your Activity or Fragment.
It is also possible that you have a JAR file located somewhere in your project folders (I had copied the Admob JAR file into my src folder) and THEN added it as a Java Path Library.
Suppose you have a package com.abc.xyz and a class named A.java inside this package, and another library project (which is added to the dependency of this project) which contains the same com.abc.xyz.A.java, then you will be getting the exact same error.
In other ways this may be occurred if you accidentally or knowingly edit/ add any thing in the class path file manually .In certain cases we may add android.jar path manually to classpath file for generating java doc.On removing the that after javadoc generated code will works fine.Please check this too if any one still occurs.
I finally traced it back to a bad additions to my .class file.
I think this was added by the plugin tools when I was trying to fix another problem, removing it got rid of the "Conversion to Dalvik format failed with error 1" build error:
Finally, I saw in the console that the error was due to duplicated class (one in the existing project, one in the added jar file) :
So check if you are adding jar with duplicated classes in your project.
This made the Android library to be added again to my referenced libraries, so now I have two Android JAR files referenced, hence I deleted one of them and now it compiles fine.
In the first place, I just deleted the directory link from the project tree and I added the JAR library to the build path, but this caused the exception.
adding the library JAR to the application project build path as usual.
got the .jar (located in a different directory outside of the project) using "Add External Jars"
In my case im having an exteranl jar added.So I moved the external jar position to top of android reference in Project Prop--->Java buildPath--->Project references
This can also be caused if you have added Android.jar file to your build path, perhaps by an accidental quick fix in Eclipse.
I had to add an Android target version under project -> properties -> Android.
I didn't have all google 'third party add-ons'.
Click in AVD SDK manager under available packages -> third-party add-ons -> Google Inc.
I had to manually add my libraries (Android and Java) to the build path, otherwise it wouldn't let me compile.
I was building debug APK using Ant and Added AdMob SDK JAR to libs/ directory.
[apply] UNEXPECTED TOP-LEVEL EXCEPTION: 
  [apply] java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: already added: Lcom/google/ads/AdActivity;

What worked for me was to remove all libraries, right-click project and select Android Tools -> *Fix Project Properties (which added back Android 1.6) and then add back the external JAR file.
I added the jSoup external JAR file to my project's path by first putting it in a source folder called "libs", and then right clicking on it, Build Path -> add to build path.
When I downloaded [Maven (hyper-link)] and re-built the protobuf-lite.jar file then added it anew as a user-library to my project everything worked fine.
I have added OpenFeint as library project:
It is also added into build path, ADT tools 16 gives error with this sceneario.
For me it happened because I added [JUnit (hyper-link)] and [Mockito (hyper-link)] libraries which were being compiled at runtime.
I was using ADT r14 and when ever i tried adding any library project, I got this error.
See also [java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: already added: Lorg/hamcrest/BaseDescription; Conversion to Dalvik format failed with error 1 (hyper-link)]
when i checked,i saw that there were 2 classes with the same name, 1 in each of the external jar file i had added.
i am also faced this problem when i am add same jar file with different versions, i simply remove old version jar an clean the project it works fine for me.
And add it again.
Make no sense remove all external libraries dependencies, if a developer add a library to his project most likely the library is needed.
adding the line -optimizations !code/allocation/variable to proguard-project.txt
In the Project SDK section, when you add an Android SDK you should
provide the Java SDK and all my Android SDKs uses Java 8 as SDK so it
create the class files with the wrong version even if the Project
level is 1.7 (i don't know why, i supposed that everything was choosed
by Project level).
"Another reason can be if you have a JAR file located somewhere in
  your project folder and then added it as a Java Path Library.
and then these two folders are also added to your build path:

Nothing worked for me here, i had to change my proguard file to add this line:
Edit: For the addition to your question, using setattr is fine.
Update: From the comment this is a repetition of: [Why can't you add attributes to object in python?
Add "%programfiles%\Git\Bin" to your PATH
Adding "%PROGRAMFILES%\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe -l -i" doesn't work for me.
The solution should be something like adding quotation marks in json file, but I didn't figure out how.
The only solution is to add "C:\Program Files\Git\bin" to %PATH% and write "commandline": "bash.exe" in profiles.json
You can also add other options like:
target git/bin/bash.exe to avoid spawning off additional processes which saves about 10MB per process according to Process Explorer compared to using bin/bash or git-bash
That means you need to add git to path when install git or add it to system environment later.
Open Settings, add following snippet inside the word profiles:
You can add icons for Tab to this location:
2) Add GitBash profile
3) Add GitBash color scheme
4) To add a right-click context menu "Windows Terminal Here"
In addition, the tab in Windows Terminal that opens will also need to be closed manually as it will display process exited information - [process exited with code 3221225786] etc.
Add the following JSON object to profiles.list.
You have to remove "useAcrylic" (if you have added it as suggested by some other answers) to make it work.
That's how I've added mine in profiles json table,
As of moment 2.8.4 - use .add(5, 'd') (or .add(5, 'days')) instead of .add('d', 5)
You're not telling it how/what unit to add.
The function add() returns the old date, but changes the original date :)
You can add days in different formats:
See more about it on Moment.js docs: [https://momentjs.com/docs/#/manipulating/add/ (hyper-link)]
add [https://momentjs.com/downloads/moment-with-locales.js (hyper-link)]  to your html page
var todayDate = moment().format('DD-MM-YYYY');//to get today date 06/03/2018 if you want to add extra day to your current date
then
var dueDate = moment().add(15,'days').format('DD-MM-YYYY')// to add 15 days to current date..
If you do end up running with formatting problems after adding X time to the function, try this format:
startDate = moment(startDate).add(1, "days").format("YYYY-MM-DD");
startDate = moment(startDate, "YYYY-MM-DD").add(1, "days");
Then you can do git rm <old directory> and git add <new directory> ([Help page (hyper-link)]).
Don't forget to add the changes to index & commit them after renaming with git mv.
After those ‘git mv’s, again, do not forget to add and commit the changes.
Add one more vote to the #!/usr/bin/env approach.
One possibility would be to not bother about reordering the columns in the table and simply modify it by add the columns.
If you want to add a single column after a specific field, then the following MySQL query should work:
If you want to add multiple columns, then you need to use 'ADD' command each time for a column.
In the second method, the last ADD COLUMN column should actually be the first column you want to append to the table.
E.g: if you want to add count, log, status in the exact order after lastname, then the syntax would actually be:
You cannot mention multiple column names with commas using ADD COLUMN.
You need to mention ADD COLUMN every time you define a new column.
ALTER TABLE listing ADD count INT(5), ADD log VARCHAR(200), ADD status VARCHAR(20) AFTER stat
I have done this code in case anyone faced my problem of adding lots of fields fast using MySQl code hope it helps , u can run this code on any online php compiler as well if u are too busy!

The ALTER TABLE command in SQLite allows the user to rename a table or to add a new column to an existing table.
It is not possible to rename a column, remove a column, or add or remove constraints from a table.
As you can see in the diagram, only ADD COLUMN is supported.
As SQLite has limited support to ALTER TABLE so you can only ADD column at end of the table OR CHANGE TABLE_NAME in SQLite.
It is not possible to rename a column, remove a column, or add or
  remove constraints from a table.
You could dump your database as described in the link above, then grab the "create table" statement and an "insert" template from that dump, then follow the instructions in the SQLite FAQ entry "How do I add or delete columns from an existing table in SQLite."
But you can however, add an extra column by using the ALTER table query.
[DB Browser for SQLite (hyper-link)] allows you to add or drop columns.
[3.35.0 from 2021-03-12 (hyper-link)] adds [ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN (hyper-link)]
[3.25.0 from 2018-09-15 (hyper-link)] added [ALTER TABLE RENAME COLUMN (hyper-link)]
[3.2.0 from way back in 2005-03-21 (hyper-link)] added [ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN (hyper-link)]
First, using the ADD instruction in a Dockerfile is very different from using a volume (either via the -v argument to docker run or the VOLUME instruction in a Dockerfile).
The ADD and COPY commands just take a copy of the files at the time docker build is run.
However, it's quite simple to achieve using COPY (which should be preferred to ADD).
Remember that any files you add to image with COPY or ADD must be inside the build context i.e.
When spinning up your stack use docker-compose -V. Without this if you added a new package and rebuilt your image it would be using the node_modules from your initial docker-compose launch.
So my short URLs add a couple of extra digits to the Base-62 string for the page number.
Then just add the append the random string to the baseURL:
Then calendly script is added to body.
I slightly tweaked his answer to come up with a solution for a long tag with various functions that was additionally already setting "src".
// add a custom component named Script
// hooks/Script.js
To add script tag or code in head tag <head>, use [react-helmet package (hyper-link)].
To add Js code in script tag inside body,
createElement uses the [innerHTML (hyper-link)] DOM API to finally add these to the DOM ([see code in React source (hyper-link)]).
innerHTML [does not execute script (hyper-link)] tag added as a security consideration.
Here is how I was finally able to add two external JavaScript files in my React JS code:
Step 2:
I then added import {Helmet} from "react-helmet"; header in my code.
Step 3:
Finally, in my code this is
how I added the external JS files using Helment
just add in body in html file
* expands to all the files in the current directory, and is only then passed to git, which adds them all.
is the current directory itself, and git adding it will add it and the all the files under it.
add * means add all files in the current directory, except for files whose name begin with a dot.
add .
has no special meaning in your shell, and thus Git adds the entire directory recursively, which is almost the same, but including files whose names begin with a dot.
The difference in meaning between 'git add .'
and 'git add *'is clearly described by [Denis (hyper-link)]:
git add expects a list of files to be added.
respectively and gives the result as a parameter to git add.
Now the difference is that with git add .
git will expand to the current directory whereas git add * triggers file globbing and such expands to all files and directories that do not start with a dot.
Additional notes (inspired by the @reka18 comment):
Note 1. git add -A and git add -u commands performed without additional parameters would be additional refinement (subdirectory or mask indication for the file name) work in the range of the entire working directory (also if we execute the command in the working subdirectory of the directory).
For example, if the git add .
or git add * command is executed in some subdirectory of a working directory, then their action is only used within this subdirectory, not the entire working directory.
The git add -A and git add -u commands can be further refined by adding a path or mask for files, for example, git add -A app/controllers or git add -u app\styles\*.
git add -A (--all) Adds everything, so that everything in your folder on disk is represented in the staging area
git add .
git add * Stages everything, but not files that begin with a dot & does not remove files that have been deleted from the disk
git add -u (--update) Stages only Modified Files, removes files that have been deleted from disk, does not add new
git add <file name 1> <file name 2> Adds only certain file(s)
You could try simply blocking the context menu by adding the following to your body tag:
you can add this to any tag you want to disable the context menu on
You should remember if you want to use the Firefox only solution, if you want to add it to the whole document you should add contextmenu="mymenu" to the <html> tag not to the body tag.
You would need to add a margin or something somewhere though
Now we will add the code from the accepted answer, and get the X and Y value of the cursor.
Just add the css transisions to fade in and out, and done!
Add to the page or element to be clicked the oncontextmenu event.
(If you are adding the ScrollView as the superview of the components just to make the TextField scroll up when keyboard comes up, then it's not needed.)
Add a UITextView to your UITableViewCells.
To bring back to original view state, add:
To get your view back to original add:
I had to add an explicit scrollRectToVisible in order to make the UITextField visible on iOS >= 3.2.
You need to add scrollview programmatically with specific frame size.
You have to add UIScrollViewDelegate in .h file.
This way, you can add your x, y, width and height values.
Step1:- I Added global notifications of UITextField, UITextView, and UIKeyboard in a singleton class.
To use it, simply add to viewDidLoad:
#define PADDING 10
Add your view controller as observer for keyboard notification
Then subclass your view controller from this KeyboardAwareController class (you may want to redefine scrollView and keyboardPadding methods):
I didn't see this possibility here, so i'm adding it, since I tried the methods in the answers but hours later discovered there is a much easier way in XCode 5 in iOS6/7:
Use NSLayoutConstraints.
In your appDelegate add this function
And add this method to initialize the activeField
[https://github.com/michaeltyson/TPKeyboardAvoiding (hyper-link)]
 download this file and add custom class as this in your table view it will manage all things for you don't need to do any thing.
You can just add a container UIView on the top of the controller's original view, then put those text fields on that view.
I add a vertical constraint from the topmost field to the container view, and create an outlet to that (topSpaceForFormConstraint in the code below).
Second add observers for keyboard notifications.
Add this to your viewDidLoad
Please add these lines in text field delegate method to scroll up in iPad.
Add a UIScrollView and add textFields on the top of it.
Add these methods : UITextFieldDelegate  & UIScrollViewDelegate.
2) Add the delegate and implement the listeners.
3) Add your animation method animateTextField to YourViewController class.
Now you can add UI elements on the top of the scroll view.
Add TextField Delegates.
Remember to add delegate and inherit UITextFieldDelegate at your header.
Delegate to add at ViewDidLoad
i had an issue with reseting to default main view while changing the text field or editing it's content (for example phone textfield and adding '-' sign, and view goes back covering textfields)
i finnaly overcome this by using auto layout and changing constraints constant, not frame size or position in notification delegates functions, like this:
You should add scrollView on your viewController.
Just add this to you pod file -> pod 'IQKeyboardManager'
Add the TextField and, whatever you want it to be floating above the keyboard while editing, to a view so they become children of the view.
without needing you to enter any code and no additional setup required.
To use IQKeyboardManager you simply need to add source files to your project
It may be a little difficult to calculate the padding, margin, cell height, but if your math is ok, it's simple.
Add my 5 cent :)
in viewDidLoad or viewDidAppear add addKeyboardObservers method.
If you have made UIView design as per above discuss hierarchy, now in your controller class you need add notifications observer in viewwillappear and remove observer in viewwilldissappear .
But this approach needs to add on every controller where ever UIView need to shifts .
KeyboardAwarePadding() will automatically add a padding in your view, It's more elegant.
No, you should not add it to source control.
All new project specific, machine local files will be added to the new location too.
I would add this to .gitignore:
And then use whatever git tool you prefer to add certain files like a shared configuration of the applicationhost.config if needed.
This way git adds the file, even if it is ignored.
[You can add comments (lines beginning with #) (hyper-link)]
Add this in your module.ts,
if ConfirmComponent is in another module, you need to export it there thus you can use it outside, add:
In the case of a dynamically loaded component and in order for a ComponentFactory to be generated, the component must also be added to the module’s entryComponents:
make sure Add new components into the routing path
Error description says that components should be added to entryComponents array and it is obvious, but make sure you have added this one in the first place:
TL;DR: A service in ng6 with providedIn: "root" cannot find the ComponentFactory when the Component is not added in the entryComponents of app.module.
So if your service is located in, for example, the "OverlayModule", where you also declared the OverlayExampleComponent and added it to the entryComponents, the service cannot find the ComponentFactory for OverlayExampleComponent.
Add that component to entryComponents in @NgModule of your app's module:
If this is your case just add the component to the module declarations and entryComponents as other responses suggest, but also add this to your module
You only need to add it to entryComponents if a component will be included in the modal.
In
  this case remember to add content component as an entryComponents
  section of your NgModule.
I discovered you need to add the dynamic component to the ag-grid module .withComponents[]
I just added entryComponents array in to my app.module.ts file.
To fix this error you can add a router to the component or add it to entryComponents of module.
Add a router to component.drawback of this approach is your
component will be accessible with that url.
Add it to entryComponents.
Add 'NgbModalModule' in imports and your component name in entryComponents App.module.ts as shown below
[ (hyper-link)]
I'm using Angular8, and I'm trying to open the component dynamically form another module, 
In this case, you need to import the module into the module that's trying to open the component, of course in addition to export the component and list it into the entryComponents array as the previous answers did.
In my case, I forgot to add MatDialogModule to imports in a child module.
In this section, you must enter the component that is used as a child in addition to declarations: [CityModalComponent](modal components) in the following section in the app.module.ts file:
I'm not sure if it will add deleted files, but git add .
from the root will add all untracked files.
Also see: [Difference of git add -A and git add .
git add -A .
on git add -A and git add -u
Also see: [Difference of git add -A and git add .
freeze - Freeze all files in the repository (additions, deletions, modifications) to the staging area, thus staging that content for inclusion in the next commit.
You want git add -A:
git add -A stages All;
git add .
git add -u stages modified and deleted, without new.
I use the following line to add for staging all the modified and newly created files, excluding the ones listed in .gitignore:
I guess that the command line option -mod should add also the deleted files...  Or, if you have file names with embedded blanks, the following one-liner should do the trick:
I tried git add -A and this prompted,
warning: The behavior of 'git add --all (or -A)' with no path argument

To add content for the whole tree, run:

Additionally, you could handle when the condition is null.
Oops, looking at the assembly code it seems that icc not only vectorized the multiplication, but also pulled the additions out of the loop.
The key thing to note here is the massive amount of manual loop-unrolling as well as interleaving of multiplies and adds...
In order to achieve peak FLOPS on Intel Haswell and AMD Bulldozer processors (and later), FMA (Fused Multiply Add) instructions will be needed.
If you would like to add vector to itself both popular solutions will fail:
It must be possible in PHP to address that case...
If one of the columns differ, the row will be added.
If the table is empty, the row will be added.
If a row exists where all the specified columns have the specified values, the row won't be added.
If you don't have this, add it, even when you don't need it at first sight.
Then we add a parameter which accepts a function argument, our callback.
Here it is 0, but still it registers an asynchronous event it will be added to the last position of the Event Queue for execution, which makes the guaranteed delay.
Also see my answer at [Visual Studio code sidebar Vertical guideline (customize sidebar) (hyper-link)] where with v1.36 you can add colorized tree indent guides to make the explorer file structure more obvious.
You can add guidelines as well with:
Adding the non-greedy quantifier ?
When you add a new character you look to see whether the active point is still in the existing tree.
Otherwise you need to add a new node to the suffix tree at the active point, fallback to the next shortest match, and check again.
Note 2:
When you add a new node and fallback you add a new suffix pointer for the new node.
Before we do this, we introduce two more variables (in addition to
#), which of course have been there all the time but we haven't used
them so far:
remainder tells us how many additional inserts we need to
make.
Important: Each insert is
done in O(1) time since the active point tells us exactly where to
go, and we need to add only one single character at the active
point.
If the text is n
characters in length, there are obviously n steps (or n+1 if we add
the dollar sign).
Additional variables used
remainder - shows the number of suffixes we must add explicitly.
When the symbol we want to add to the tree is already on the edge, we, according to Observation 1, update only active point and remainder, leaving the tree unchanged.
Let's look at the example of a suffix tree for cdddcdc if we add a suffix link in such case and if we don't:
If we DON'T connect the nodes through a suffix link:

before adding the last letter c:

[image]

after adding the last letter c:

[image]
If we DO connect the nodes through a suffix link:

before adding the last letter c:

[image]

after adding the last letter c:

[image]
The problem is that if we don't put a suffix link here, later, when we add some new letters to the tree, we might omit adding some nodes to the tree due to the Rule 3, because, according to it, if there's no a suffix link, then we must put the active_node to the root.
When we were adding the last letter to the tree, the red node had already existed before we made an insert from the blue node (the edge labled 'c').
We need additional variable(s) to keep that information.
That case we only need add a new leaf to that node, take it as a standard edge split operation, which means the suffix links if there's any, should be maintained correspondingly.
(However, I did have to add some basic narrative for the flow, so the beginning might indeed feel redundant.)
This way when we add additional characters, those characters will be implicitly added to all suffix labels, without having to visit and update all of them.
The branching operations we execute on the tree (the addition of new branch nodes and leaf nodes) won't propagate automatically everywhere they need to.
For example in case of the string 'ABCXABCY' (see below), a branching to X and Y needs to be added to three different suffixes, ABC, BC and C; otherwise it wouldn't be a valid suffix tree, and we couldn't find all substrings of the string by matching characters from the root downwards.
Since, when we add the repeated character A (and the rest of the repeated characters in succession), we have no idea yet when/where do we need to split the suffix into two branches.
The variable remainder tells us how many repeated characters we added implicitly, without branching; i.e.
Here we split the previously added ABCX into ABC->X and ABC->Y.
Lastly, we need to add the current character (Y) itself to the root as well.
Of course one big question is how to add these links.
The existing answer is that we can add the links when we insert new branch nodes, utilizing the fact that, in each extension of the tree, the branch nodes are naturally created one after another in the exact order we'd need to link them together.
Secondly, even after adding the edge information, we still have no way to identify a position that is farther down in the tree, and not directly connected to the root node.
As I mentioned above, even in the case of using the suffix link, the 'active length' is often not compatible with the linked position, since that branch of the tree might contain additional branching.
add to angular-cli-build.js file:
[code snippet]
add to index.html
[code snippet]
In the angular-cli.json file locate the styles[] array and  add  font-awesome references directory here, like below:
[code snippet]

In more recent versions of Angular, use the angular.json file instead, without the ../.
and add MatIconModule to your @NgModule imports
If you have issues with ElectronJS or similar and have a sort of 404 error, a possible workaround is to uedit your webpack.config.js, by adding (and by assuming that you have the font-awesome node module installed through npm or in the package.json file):
UPDATE Feb 2020:
[fortawesome (hyper-link)] package now supports [ng add (hyper-link)] but it is available [only for angular 9 (hyper-link)] and up:
Add FontAwesomeModule to imports in src/app/app.module.ts:
If you're using Angular CLI, add the font-awesome CSS to styles inside the angular-cli.json
Install the font-awesome library and add the dependency to package.json
To add Font Awesome CSS icons to your app...
Add the following to _variables.scss:
$fa-font-path : '../node_modules/font-awesome/fonts';
In styles.scss add the following:
Add it in your package.json as 
"devDependencies" 
font-awesome : "version number"
Just added this in case it helps someone find the answer quicker than I did :-)
You can always edit index.html and add font awesome CSS in the head.
Add  node_modules/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css to angular.json.
Remember not to add any dots in front of the node_modules/.
Option 1: Add the css-Files
Add the following package:
Afterwards add the following lines to your angular.json:
Just follow their documentation to add the icons.
They use the svg-icons, so you only have to add the svgs / icons, you really use.
Install the font-awesome library and add the dependency to package.json.
To add Font Awesome CSS icons to your app...
Add the following to _variables.scss:
In styles.scss add the following:
If you are building angular project, you also need to add these imports in your angular.json :
I just want to add here that if any one want to call a function on load event of div & you don't want to use jQuery(due to conflict as in my case) then simply call a function after all the html code or any other code you have written including the function code and 
simply call a function .
we can use MutationObserver to solve the problem in efficient way adding a sample code below
You cannot add event onload on div, but you can add onkeydown and trigger onkeydown event on document load
You need to add a height constraint to your horizontal list.
Adding these properties in List View Worked for me.
If anyone have another solution please, mention in comment or add answer.
add shrinkWrap: true and physics: NeverScrollableScrollPhysics() in ListView
and I wanted to scroll last scroll view with the whole column
for this add
First, you have to add a ListView, an EditText and a button into your activity_main.xml.
Now, whenever this data will be altered, it will affect the list view and thus add the item to it, after you'll call adapter.notifyDataSetChanged();.
If you're using a RecyclerView, update only the last element (if you've added it at the end of the list of objs) to save memory with: mAdapter.notifyItemInserted(mItems.size() - 1);
Otherwise if you want to add 2 calls in ng-click you can add ';' after edit($index) like this
ng-click="edit($index); open()"
Add the function to the html
The standard way to add Multiple functions
and all your *.java files will be added recursively.
[Sergio Acosta's answer (hyper-link)] is probably your best bet if some of the files to be added may not already be tracked.
You can use git add [path]/\*.java to add java files from subdirectories,
e.g.
git add ./\*.java for current directory.
From [git add documentation (hyper-link)]:
Adds content from all *.txt files under Documentation directory and its subdirectories:
Adding *.txt:
If you are already tracking your files and have made changes to them and now you want to add them selectively based on a pattern, you can use the --modified flag
For example, if you only want to add the CSS changes to this commit, you can do
As mentioned in "[git: How do I recursively add all files in a directory subtree that match a glob pattern?
(hyper-link)]", if you properly escape or quote your  pathspec globbing (like '*.java'), then yes, git add '*.java'
Git 2.13 (Q2 2017) improves that for interactive add:
I wanted to only add files that had a certain string based on git status:
git status | grep string | xargs git add
Just use git add *\*.java.
This will add all .java files in root directory and all subdirectories.
Adding a Windows command line solution that was not yet mentioned:
[alias]
         addt = !sh -c 'git ls-files | grep \"\\.$1*\" | xargs git add' -
If you want to add all modified java file can just do:
git addt java
Samely, if you want to add all modified python file can just do:
git addt py
As it's not mentioned here, consider also the "[magic signature (hyper-link)]" :/ to recursively add anything matching below the project root:
headers(added 1.5)
A map of additional header key/value pairs to send along with the request.
Assuming JQuery ajax, you can add custom headers like -
If you want to add a custom header (or set of headers) to an individual request then just add the headers property:
If you want to add a default header (or set of headers) to every request then use $.ajaxSetup():
If you want to add a header (or set of headers) to every request  then use the beforeSend hook with $.ajaxSetup():
Override XMLHttpRequest's send method and add the header there:
You have your arguments to the remote add command reversed:
If you want to share a locally created repository, or you want to take contributions from someone elses repository - if you want to
  interact in any way with a new repository, it's generally easiest to
  add it as a remote.
You do that by running git remote add [alias]
  [url].
That adds [url] under a local remote named [alias].
Use [unshift (hyper-link)], which modifies the existing array by adding the arguments to the beginning:
Use .unshift() to add to the beginning of an array.
will add a nice shadow-like effect to the left and right of the elements that normally make up a document.
Just use ::after or ::before pseudo element to add the shadow.
If you read the discussion in the [issue 2745 (hyper-link)] not only docker may never support symlinks they may never support adding files outside your context.
For instance, this command will give the ADD command access to anything in your current directory.
Then a second dockerfile pulls that image and adds the data and creates a new image which is then deployed and never stored anywhere.
As is described in [this (hyper-link)] GitHub issue the build actually happens in /tmp/docker-12345, so a relative path like ../relative-add/some-file is relative to /tmp/docker-12345.
It would thus search for /tmp/relative-add/some-file, which is also shown in the error message.
Since the build context is now one directory higher, I had to make a few additional changes:
Copy shared (in addition to api/src or frontend/src)
[code snippet]
you should read the file, every time you want to add a new property to the json, and then add the the new properties
Add some data to it, for example:

In addition, ruby one-line comments start always with #, so the <%=# Comment %> style matches perfectly with both pure-ruby and erb styles for one-line comments.
You can achieve this by adding Gesture Recogniser in your code.
There are a number of commonly used touch events (or gestures) that you can be notified of when you add a [Gesture Recognizer (hyper-link)] to your view.
In addition to these, you can also make your own custom gesture recognizer.
To add a gesture programmatically, you (1) create a gesture recognizer, (2) add it to a view, and (3) make a method that is called when the gesture is recognized.
You can study the gesture recognizers that I added to these views to see how they work.
You can add multiple gesture recognizers to a single view.
Another way is adding a transparent button to the view
You can add it to the view after that.
[view ss_addTapViewEventListener:^(UITapGestureRecognizer *recognizer) { ... } numberOfTapsRequired:1];
Use UITapGestureRecognizer for to add touch event
How do I add a touch event to a UIView?
Additionally, UIControl inherits from UIView so you're not losing any functionality.
Note: Other suggested solutions that involve removing and then re-adding the project to the solution will break project references.
Go back to Visual Studio, and in Solution Explorer, right click the solution and choose Add -> Existing project.
Now the project is back in the solution, but the project doesn't seem to be added to source control.
If you had inter-project references to the project you renamed, you need to add them again to the individual projects that referenced it.
Now readd the solution mapping to your workspace and get the latest version.
My workaround to accomplish this is to create the project with the last part of the path as its name, so that it doesn't create an additional directory:
You get a question: "Projects have recently been added to this solution.
You'll be told that there're new projects added.
Remove the project from the solution and add it again, and then check-in.
Add the existing project to the solution (your renamed project)
It said something like "re-adding project".
Use the Git move command like this:
[code snippet]
See documentation for additional options: [https://git-scm.com/docs/git-mv (hyper-link)]
Add each project back in using Add existing project from Solution.
I changed a few lines of the source of stat_smooth and related functions to make a new function that adds the fit equation and R squared value.
It addresses comments by @shabbychef and @MYaseen208.
@MYaseen208 this shows how to add a hat.
[2017-03-08] @elarry Edit to more precisely address the original question, showing how to add a comma between the equation- and R2-labels.
To allow use to customize the regression formula (instead of fixed as y and x as literal variable names), and added the p-value into the printout as well (as @Jerry T commented), here is the mod:
I also added an option to output it as latex so you can use this function in a rmarkdown like this:
Now we need to add the text to the plot:

I got the same error while trying to add an fk.
There is a pitfall I have experienced with "Error 1215: Cannot add foreign key constraint" when using Laravel 4, especially with JeffreyWay's Laravel 4 Generators.
I am sure, there are even more, similarly subtle issues when adding these sort of constraints, which is why when coming across constraint errors, always make sure that the constraints and their implications make sense in your current context.
I just wanted to add this case as well for VARCHAR foreign key relation.
I changed this to VARCHAR and I can get the values from a reference table so that I don't have to alter the parent table to add additional options.
On using this command I got the following verbose description for the error with no additional helpful information
Failed to add the foreign key constraint.
Error 1452: Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint

(Props to this page for pointing it out: [https://www.percona.com/blog/2017/04/06/dealing-mysql-error-code-1215-cannot-add-foreign-key-constraint/ (hyper-link)])
Rename the table something, maybe just add the word "copy" next to the current table name.
So added a child table to that code line when creating it.
I'm not sure if this is already in the task framework of Microsoft - but if it isn't that would be one of the first things I would add.
The async and await keywords don't cause additional threads to be
  created.
This context contains things specific to the original Http request such as the original Request object which has things like language, IP address, headers, etc.
The way I understand it is also, there should be a third term added to the mix: Task.
Same code above added as image below:
[ (hyper-link)]
Create 'Task' (only one task and it will be an additional method)
Additional Notes - Update
Otherwise the overhead added by async (creating the state machine, execution context etc) eats up all the benefits.
To make it a touch less java specific, the basic principle would be to convert to some linear date format, julian days, modified julian days, seconds since some epoch, etc, add your day, and convert back.
So adding the milliseconds for a day, does the trick.
use DateTime object obj.Add to add what ever you want day hour and etc.
Look to new methods added to the old classes.
You could add a day to this, but keep in mind this in UTC.
You can also represent your span-of-time to be added, the one day, as a Period.
Java 9 adds some minor features and fixes.
The [ThreeTen-Extra (hyper-link)] project extends java.time with additional classes.
This project is a proving ground for possible future additions to java.time.
Time zone is crucial as adding a day to get the same [wall-clock time (hyper-link)] tomorrow might mean making adjustments such as for a 23-hour or 25-hour day in the case of [Daylight Saving Time (DST) (hyper-link)] here in the United States.
After adding a day, we convert the DateTime object back into a java.util.Date object.
Similarly, you can add MONTHS, DAYS, MINUTES etc
Change value of no_of_day_to_add as you want.
I have set value of no_of_day_to_add to 1 because u wanted only one day to add.
I found a simple method to add arbitrary time to a Date object

Right click the Bookmarks Bar, and click Add Page
The [top answer, by jondavidjohn (hyper-link)] is good but I'd like to tweak it to address a couple of points:
Adding to @jondavidjohn's answer, we can also set it as a bookmark with URL as the javascript code.
and then add it to the toolbar of Chrome or Firefox so that instead of pasting the script again and again, we can just click on the bookmarklet.
which can be pasted either directly in Console or create a new Bookmark page (in Chrome right-click on the Bookmark Bar, Add Page...) and paste this code as URL.
this answer based on @genesis answer, at first I tried the bookmark version @jondavidjohn, and it is not working, so I change it to this (add it to your bookmark):
You can change the src address.
It adds your parameter to end, so you can get latest value in your back-end code.
It adds your parameter to the end"
Using my editParams() function, you can add, remove, or change any parameter, then use the built in replaceState() function to update the URL:
This is what I use when it comes to some basic url param additions or updates on the server-side like Node.js.
Following function will help you to add,update and delete parameters to or from URL.
As best I can tell none of the above answers address the case where the query string contains parameters which are themselves an array and hence will appear more than once, e.g:
Easiest solution, works if you have already a tag or not, and removes it automatically so it wont keep adding equal tags, have fun

So try adding the following to your ~/.curlrc file:
Edit, to make things more readable you can add ANSI colours to the -w line, it's not that easy to write directly, but [this (hyper-link)] script can generate a ~/.curlrc file with colours.
The general solution for bash is to add a newline symbol into the command prompt:
I managed to get a new line added dynamically to prompt when command output didn't have a new line at end.
Set the default value adding :default => 1
add_column :table, :column, :boolean, :default => 1
So if you have a column with no default value, then you should do this to add a default value.
As of Rails 4 you can't generate a migration to add a column to a table with a default value,
The following steps add a new column to an existing table with default value true or false.
Run the migration from command line to add the new column
The above command will add a new column in your table.
Re-add server and everything then worked.
Step1: Windows --> Preferences --> Server --> Run time Environments
  --> Add --> select the tomcat version which was unavailable before --> next --> browse the location of your server with same version
Note that git will not ignore a file that was already tracked before a rule was added to this file to ignore it.
To address your question though, you may need to either de-index the .tmproj file (if you've already added it to the index) with git rm --cached path/to/.tmproj, or git add and commit your .gitignore file.
So in the case of the given question, it might make sense to first check for an existing excludes file, and add the new file mask to it.
Then you should open it with some kind of notepad and add the needed ignore rules.

What is git remote add ...?
The command git remote add origin git@github.com:peter/first_app.git creates a new remote called origin located at git@github.com:peter/first_app.git.

The OP is asking about whether it is possible to add an Attribute to an Entity class for a Unique Key.
If you'd like to use an Attribute to add Unique Keys to your Entity Framework Core entity classes, you can do what I've posted [here (hyper-link)]
We can add Unique key index by using fluent api.
This adds the required unique index in the database.
You should also add a sticky bit on the folder so that all the files created in the folder will always have the group of git.
I just wanted to add my solution.
After you add some stuff... commit them and after all finished push it!
If some other person tries to add/commit/push same files, or content (git keep both as same objects), we will face the following error:
After that you will need to add a new property that is equivalent to --shared=group done for the new repository, according to the documentation, this make the repository group-writable, do it executing:
Add this repo as another remote repo in your local repo.
(git remote add foo //SERVERNAME/path/to/copied/git)
There is a possibility also that you added another local repository with the same alias.
I'll add my two cents just as a way to discover files with a specific ownership inside a directory.
Add one more property android:singleLine="true" in your Textview
this will restrict texview length to 13  but problem is if you try to add 3 dots(...), it wont display it, as it will be part of textview length.
You can limit your textview's number of characters and add (...) after the text.
EDIT:
I have added check for less character as per your limited no.
This cuts off the text that doesn't fit but lets users know that the text has been truncated by adding an ellipsis (the three dots).
You need to add following lines into your layout for the textview
Add These two lines in your text
Steps to add '...' at end of the text if it is too long:
add these two lines
android:ellipsize="end" android:maxLines="1"
Thanks to @tokeinizer_fsj that told me in a comment that I didn't get completely the meaning of the question (I thought that add meant just adding keys that eventually where different in the two dictinaries and, instead, i meant that the common key values should be summed).
So I added that loop before the merging, so that the second dictionary contains the sum of the common keys.
For in-place operations such as c[key]
+= 1, the value type need only support addition and subtraction.
There are no type restrictions, but the value type
  needs to support addition, subtraction, and comparison.
It works like dict.update() but adds counts instead of replacing them.
Additionally, please note a.update( b ) is 2x faster than a + b
This can be easily done by adding at the top of the script the following PHP code:
I always recommended to add the following statement, while coding:
This error will not cause an exception, therefore, some developers will occasionally suppress the warning by adding the error suppression operator @ before the expression.
If the value is zero you either should not divide, or you should change the value to 1 and then divide so the division results in the equivalent of having divided only by the additional variable.
You can actually avoid this error by not adding E_STRICT to error_reporting(), eg
Just double clicking the file will likely open it in your browser using an address such as:

This kind of syntax is called [IIFE (hyper-link)] and it was [added in PHP 7 (hyper-link)].
It's a much better way to remove it from status... Also be aware that any fresh clone of you repo will have to add its .gitignore, which can be annoying.
If you want files ignored for your clone only, add them to .git/info/exclude, not in  .gitignore file.
If you want to ignore files in just one repository but want to avoid committing the ignore list (for example for personal files) you can add them to .git/info/exclude in that repository.
Simply run git reset directory, it will unstage all newly added files.
You need to import { REACTIVE_FORM_DIRECTIVES } from '@angular/forms' in your controller and add it to directives in @Component.
After you fix that, you will probably get another error because you didn't add formControlName="name" to your input in form.
If you have to import two modules then add like this below
For my case, I've been using multiple modules files, i added ReactiveFormsModule in app.module.ts
But this wasn't working when I use a [formGroup] directive from a component added in another module, e.g.
I thought if i added ReactiveFormsModule in app.module.ts, by default ReactiveFormsModule would be inherited by all its children modules like author.module in this case...
IF YOU ARE DOING TESTING, find your *.specs.ts file and add :
Then add FormsModule and ReactiveFormsModule in to your imports array.
If you have this problem when you developing a component so you should add these two modules to your closest module :
And if you are developing a test for your components so you should add this module to your test file like this:
Then add FormsModule and ReactiveFormsModule into your Module's imports array.
You may be thinking that I have already added it in AppModule and it should inherit from it?
step 2: add "ReactiveFormsModule" to import section
Then add FormsModule and ReactiveFormsModule in to your imports array.
import { FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
and add it in imports array in the app-module.ts file.
I moved a component (that uses the [formGroup] directive) from one project to another, but failed to add the component to the declarations array in the new module.
I added the ReactiveFormsModule and FormsModule as mentionned in the comments above in both of my modules but it had no effect until I reloaded my project with another "ng serve".
And you have already imported FormsModule, ReactiveFormsModule and added it into your imports-section within e.g.
I added the component in routing module but didn't include it main module.
Then press m to bring up the NERDTree Filesystem Menu and choose a for "add child node".
A little adding because I had to use different answers to get the actual solution (for me).
You just need to add a second parameter.
where 2 is total number of digits, for 0 ~ 9 -> it will display 00 to 09 rest nothing will be added.
Additionally, there is small "hack" to put float number into dimension, but be WARNED that this is really hack, and you are risking chance to lose float range and precision.

I know I'm late to the party, but you could try spacing the boxes with padding.
How about just adding a border the same color as the background using css?
it's simple .. you have to add solid border right, left to col-* 
and it should be work ..:)
The root problem is that columns in bootstrap 3 and 4 use padding instead of margin.
This way you still get proper padding inside your columns.
I have seen solutions that appear to work by creating space, but unfortunately the columns they create have extra padding on either side of the row so it ends up making the row thinner that the grid layout was designed for.
To obtain a particular width of spacing between columns, we have to set up padding in the standard Bootstrap's layout.
Inside the col-md-?, create another div and put picture in that div, than you can easily add padding like so.
Bootstrap 4, file custom.scss you can add following code:
This by default provides some padding inside the outer div the way you seem to need.
Moreover you can also modify the padding using custom CSS.
As a workaround to other solutions, I propose make both columns "col-md-5" instead of "col-md-6", and then in the parent element "row" that contains the columns, add the class "justify-content-between", which puts the free space in the middle, as you can check in the bootstrap doc [here (hyper-link)]
Each column has horizontal padding (called a gutter) for controlling the space between them.
This padding is then counteracted on the rows with negative margins.
So the right answer is: set cols' padding-left/right equal to minus your row's margin-left/right.
I needed one column on mobile and two columns from tablet portrait up, with equal spacing between them in the middle (also without any grid-added padding inside columns).
According to Bootstrap 4 [documentation (hyper-link)] you should give the parent a negative margin mx-n*, and the children a positive padding px-*
Where 1em on the max-width is equal to the left/right margin added together.
I have just added a block element like div and set border for the differences.
also adding some extra padding or margin in that extra div will work perfectly..
Instead of adding the image to the
image view, clear the subviews of
the image view, create a custom 
view that adds an UIImageView for the image and another view, perhaps a simple UIView that provides the desired spacing, and add it as a subview of the
image view.
I want to suggest that you manipulate the UIImageView directly to set a fixed size/padding, but I'm nowhere near Xcode so I can't confirm whether/how this would work.
If you are not using section headers (or footers) already, you can use them to add arbitrary spacing to table cells.
Since you can't literally add space between cells you can fake it by manipulating the UITableView's cell height and then adding a UIView to the contentView of your cell.
The way I achieve adding spacing between cells is to make numberOfSections = "Your array count" and make each section contains only one row.
add a inner view to the cell then add your own views to it.
(That is, add a UITableView and hook up the tableView outlet to the View Controller).
How did you get the extra padding/space on the right and left?
I got it the same way you add spacing to any view.
Just use the [pin tool (hyper-link)] in the Interface Builder to add spacing for the leading and trailing constraints.
Yes you can increase or decrease the spacing(padding) between two cell by creating one base view on content view in cell.Set clear colour for content view background and you can adjust the height of the base view to create space between cells.
add tableview in view controller
add a customcell for tablview cell
In it, he only applies them to left and right sides but the UIEdgeInsetsMake init allows to add padding to all four points.
Based on Husam's answer: Using the cell layer instead of content view allows for adding a border around the entire cell and the accessory if need.
All you have left to do is make the cell's height bigger by the same value as your desired verticalPadding, and then modify your inner layout so that any views that had spacing to the edges of the cell have that same spacing increased by verticalPadding/2.
Minor downside: you get verticalPadding/2 padding on both the top and bottom of the tableView, but you can quickly fix this by setting tableView.contentInset.bottom = -verticalPadding/2 and tableView.contentInset.top = -verticalPadding/2.
2) Re-position this view in layoutSubviews to add the idea of spacing
In the custom cell, make a background view with constraints so that it doesn't fill the entire cell, give it some padding.
1) Add an ImageView to the bottom of your table cell view.
it's important to add subview (container) and put other elements in it.
I'd like to warn everyone who wants to use the solution like adding headers that will serve the purpose of spacing.
In case you need to animate insertions and deletions of rows I would go with adding this space in the cells itself.
To add spacing between rows, a second prototype cell is to be used.
Add a different cell Identifier to the second prototype cell, then add an empty view and constraint its edges to the edges of the cell, then set the emptyView's color to "clear".
Adding my 2 cents to the @kad81 answer,
Check NETFramework of the referred dll & the Project where you are adding the DLL.
I tried cleaning, rebuilding, removing and readding the project reference, etc... with no success.
Most of the times the reason would be that current project ( where you are adding reference of another project ) points to a different .net framework version than the rest ones.
I found that the path to package folder is not updated when you add a reference so restarting VS, changing .NET version, or any mentioned recommendation does not solve the problem.
The .nuget folder was missing from where that .sln file was added.
I came back later and added the .sln file to the root and deleted the subfolder.
One of the reasons to get this annoying yellow triangle is that you are adding a reference to a project twice, meaning:
project c references project a (which adds implicit ref.
If you're using the newer style Sdk projects add OutputType to the ProjectGroup element with a value of Library in the project you're referencing.
add to A all rows from X where the first element < 3:
As this question is been 7 years before, in the latest version which I am using is numpy version 1.13, and python3, I am doing the same thing with adding a row to a matrix, remember to put a double bracket to the second argument, otherwise, it will raise dimension error.

If no calculations are necessary after every row, it's much quicker to add rows in python, then convert to numpy.
Here are timing tests using python 3.6 vs. numpy 1.14, adding 100 rows, one at a time:
So, the simple solution to the original question, from seven years ago, is to use vstack() to add a new row after converting the row to a numpy array.
If you don't need to run data analysis on the array after every addition, it is better to buffer the new rows to a python list of rows (a list of lists, really), and add them as a group to the numpy array using vstack() before doing any data analysis.
I use numpy.insert(arr, i, the_object_to_be_added, axis) in order to insert  object_to_be_added at the i'th row(axis=0) or column(axis=1)

Optionally, you can amend your merge commit before you push it, if you want to add a summary of what was done in the development branch.
So you can change a given list by adding or removing elements.
Tuple can only allow adding tuple to it.
Bottom line, the easiest way to append to a tuple is to enclose the element being added with parentheses and a comma.
The label instances on the left are dynamically added using the button.

Although it's okay to add a subview to a control, there's no guarantee it'll actually work, because the control might not expect it to be there and might thus behave poorly.
If you can get away with it, just add the label as a sibling view of the button and set its frame so that it overlaps the button; as long as it's set to appear on top of the button, nothing the button can do will obscure it.
I added this code in the -titleRectForContentRect: of a UIButton subclass but the code can also be placed in drawing routine of the UIButton superview, which in that case you shall replace all references to self with the UIButton's variable.
Add to use this with config file like Plist, you need to use CDATA to write the multilined title, like this:
I just wanted to add that if you are using storyboards, you can type [Ctrl+Enter] to force a newline on a button title field.
If you want to add a button with the title centered with multiple lines, set your Interface Builder's settings for the button:
You have to add this code:
I had an issue with auto-layout, after enabling multi-line the result was like this:

You can add files using git add, example git add README, git add <folder>/*, or even git add *
When you make modifications run git status which gives you the list of files modified, add them using git add * for everything or you can specify each file individually, then git commit -m <message> and finally, git push -u origin master
Run git add README, the files are staged for committing.
Then run git status again, it should give you - the files have been added and ready for committing.
Then run git commit -m 'Added README'
Run these commands

When adding a directory to github check that the directory does not contain a .git file using "ls -a" if it does remove it.
.git files in a directory will cause problems when you are trying to add a that directory in git
if you want add folder to existing repo ..then add folder to local project code
If you want to add an empty folder you can add a '.keep' file in your folder.
Then "git add ."

If u want to add Hello world at the end of each line:
List has the method [add(int, E) (hyper-link)], so you can use:
You can take a look at the [add(int index, E element) (hyper-link)]:
Shifts the element currently at that position (if any) and any
  subsequent elements to the right (adds one to their indices).
Once you add you can then check the size of the ArrayList and remove the ones at the end.
Since you want to add new element, and remove the old one.
You can add at the end, and remove from the beginning.
Queue has methods add(e) and remove() which adds at the end the new element, and removes from the beginning the old element, respectively.
So, every time you add an element to the queue you can back it up with a remove method call.
As you can see, when the maximum size is reached, then adding new element automatically removes the first element inserted.
If  deleting the oldest element is necessary then you can add:
Otherwise list will add your object at beginning and also retain oldest element.
There are various data structures which are optimized for adding elements at the first index.
The JDK includes the [Deque (hyper-link)] structure which offers methods like [addFirst(e) (hyper-link)] and [offerFirst(e) (hyper-link)]
You can use list methods, remove and add
Java LinkedList provides both the addFirst(E e) and the push(E e) method that add an element to the front of the list.
[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html#addFirst(E) (hyper-link)]
I had a similar problem, trying to add an element at the beginning of an existing array, shift the existing elements to the right and discard the oldest one (array[length-1]).
After that you'll be able to add this folder as a submodule.

This way you don't need to add the CSS outside of the component:
Günter's answer is great (question is asking for dynamic class attribute) but I thought I would add just for completeness...
If you're looking for a quick and clean way to add one or more static classes to the host element of your component (i.e., for theme-styling purposes) you can just do:
In the component, add an input:
Then in the component's HTML template add something like:
You can simply add @HostBinding('class') class = 'someClass'; inside your @Component class.
If you want to add a dynamic class to your host element, you may combine your HostBinding with a getter as

So, you could add a custom header such as: x-Trigger: CORS, and that should trigger the pre-flight request and hit the OPTIONS block.

If you also add a FilterRegistrationBean you can additionally specify individual servlets and url patterns to apply.
There are three ways to add your filter,
[Embedded servlet containers - Add a Servlet, Filter or Listener to an application (hyper-link)]
To add a Servlet, Filter, or Servlet *Listener provide a @Bean
definition for it.
Add this @Bean configuration to your @Configuration class and the filter will be registered on startup.
Also you can add Servlets, Filters, and Listeners using classpath scanning,
And I added it to the Spring Boot configuration by adding it to Configuration class as follows:
In the below example, I'm adding a custom filter before the UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter (see [all the default Spring Security filters and their order (hyper-link)]).
But you also need to add @ServletComponentScan annotation in your @SpringBootApplication class:
First, add @ServletComponentScan to your SpringBootApplication class.
Second, create a filter file extending Filter or third-party filter class and add @WebFilter to this file like this:
Add @ServletComponentScan to your Main Class
You may add a package named filter inside it.
Also you can add  &lt;br&gt; instead of \n.
And then you can add text to TexView:
for the new line in TextView just add \n in middle of your text
it works..
Add \n in XML strings, while reading:
For me the solution was to add the following line to the layout:
Go to values> strings inside add string
use "\n" to add new line
then add the string name inside the text view
You can use the addMethod()
Thanks to the answer of redsquare I added a method like this:
Additionally, it looks like there is a file called additional-methods.js that contains the method "pattern", which can be a RegExp when created using the method without quotes.

As mentioned on the [addMethod documentation (hyper-link)]:
Please note: While the temptation is great to add a regex method that checks it's parameter against the value, it is much cleaner to encapsulate those regular expressions inside their own method.
So yes, you have to add a method for each regular expression.
PS: there is also bundled plugin for that, [https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/blob/master/src/additional/pattern.js (hyper-link)]
You may use pattern defined in the additional-methods.js file.
Note that this additional-methods.js file must be included after jQuery Validate dependency, then you can just use
Note: make sure to escape all the "\" of ur regex by adding another "\" in front of them else the regex wont work as expected.
[LinearLayout (hyper-link)] is a subclass of [ViewGroup (hyper-link)], which has a method called [addView (hyper-link)].
The [addView (hyper-link)] method should be what you are after.
Calling addView is the correct answer, but you need to do a little more than that to get it to work.
If you create a View via a constructor (e.g., Button myButton = new Button();), you'll need to call setLayoutParams on the newly constructed view, passing in an instance of the parent view's LayoutParams inner class, before you add your newly constructed child to the parent view.
I struggled with getting Views added to a TableRow to display properly until I figured out that I wasn't passing an instance of TableRow.LayoutParams to the child view's setLayoutParams.
This is late but this may help someone :) :)
For adding the view programmatically try like
You can add any number of view as same.
please notice that you need a ViewGroup in order to add a view (which is any layout you can think of)
so as an example lets say you have a fragment which it view already been inflated and you know that the root view is a layout, and you want to add a view to it:
One more way to add view from Activity
All you need to do is inflate the view programmatically and it as a child to the FrameLayout by using addChild() method.
Per Android recommendation, you should add only one childView to FrameLayout[ [link] (hyper-link)].
(Note that setting last parameter of findViewById to null and adding view by calling addView() on container view (frameLayout) is same as simply attaching the inflated view by passing true in 3rd parameter of findViewById().
I'm pretty sure you can't simply add on delete cascade to an existing foreign key constraint.

Using the provided CSS, you can add a tooltip to an element using the data-tooltip attribute.

Click My Apps then click the app you want do add the purchase to
For this tutorial, we are going to be adding an in-app purchase to remove ads, so choose non-consumable.
Click the blue add language button, and input the information.
At the bottom, you should see linked frameworks and libraries click the little plus symbol and add the framework StoreKit.framework If you don't do this, the in-app purchase will NOT work!
In your bridging header file, add the line #import "MyObjectiveCHeaderFile.h", where MyObjectiveCHeaderFile is the name of the header file that you created in step one.
So, for example, if you named your header file InAppPurchase.h, you would add the line #import "InAppPurchase.h" to your bridge header file.
Add the following code into your .h file:
Next, you need to import the StoreKit framework into your .m file, as well as add SKProductsRequestDelegate and SKPaymentTransactionObserver after your @interface declaration:
and now add the following into your .m file, this part gets complicated, so I suggest that you read the comments in the code:
Now you want to add your code for what will happen when  the user finishes the transaction, for this tutorial, we use removing adds, you will have to add your own code for what happens when the banner view loads.
Now, somewhere in your viewDidLoad method, you're going to want to add the following code:
Now that you have added all the code, go into your .xib or storyboard file, and add two buttons, one saying purchase, and the other saying restore.
I hope this helps to all of those hoping to add an in-app purchase to their iOS application.
2 - Issue payment request - use SKPayment & SKPaymentQueue to add payment to the transaction queue.
Now that you've set up your in-app purchase information on App Store Connect, we need to add Apple's framework for in-app-purchases, StoreKit, to the app.
Turn this capability ON, and Xcode will add StoreKit to your project.
Next, we're going to add a variable to define the identifier for our in-app purchase (you could also use an enum, which would be easier to maintain if you have multiple IAPs).
Let's add an initializer for our class next:
Now, we're going to add the required functions for SKProductsRequestDelegate and SKPaymentTransactionObserver to work:
We'll add the RemoveAdsManager class later
Now let's add some functions that can be used to start a purchase or a restore purchases:
Next, let's add a new utilities class to manage our IAPs.
Let's add some code to the first two functions, removeAds and restoreRemoveAds:
And lastly, let's add some code to the last five functions.
Lastly, you need to add some way for the user to start the purchase and call RemoveAdsManager.removeAds() and start a restore and call RemoveAdsManager.restoreRemoveAds(), like a button somewhere!

Add is same as svn's add (how ever sometimes it is used to mark file resolved).
add tells git to start tracking a file.
git add adds files to the Git index, which is a staging area for objects prepared to be commited.
git commit commits the files in the index to the repository, git commit -a is a shortcut to add all the modified tracked files to the index first.
git add adds your modified files to the queue to be committed later.
git commit commits the files that have been added and creates a new revision with a log...
If you do not add any files, git will not commit anything.
git add isn't on the figure because the suggested way to commit is the combined git commit -a, but you can mentally add a git add to the change block to understand the flow.
git add selects changes
I was confused about what 'add' really does.
I just read a very enlightening paragraph from the book Git Pro that I'd like to add here, because it clarifies things
It turns out that Git stages a file exactly as it is when you run the
git add command.
If you commit now, the version of benchmarks.rb as it
was when you last ran the git add command is how it will go into the
commit, not the version of the file as it looks in your working
directory when you run git commit.
If you modify a file after you run
git add, you have to run git add again to stage the latest version of
the file
add -in git is used to tell git which files we want to commit, it puts files to the staging area
example 
Staging a file named index.html
git add index.html
I think the problem is you need to add GO statement in between to separate the execution into batches.
[view.setPadding(0,padding,0,0); (hyper-link)]
This will set the top padding to padding-pixels.
You can set padding to your view by pro grammatically throughout below code -
And, also there are different type of padding available -
[Padding (hyper-link)]
[PaddingBottom (hyper-link)]
[PaddingLeft (hyper-link)]
[PaddingRight (hyper-link)]
[PaddingTop (hyper-link)]
like SpK and Jave suggested, will set the padding in pixels.
If you store the padding in resource files, you can simply call
Write Following Code to set padding, it may help you.
While padding programmatically, convert to density related values by converting pixel to Dp.
Essentially, TypedValue.applyDimension converts the desired padding into pixels appropriately depending on the current device's display properties.
use below method for setting padding dynamically
I strongly recommend putting your dp padding in dimen xml file and use the official Android conversions to have consistent behaviour with regard to how Android framework works.
The bit in the angle brackets (<Integer> and <String>) gets removed, so you'd end up with two methods that have an identical signature (the add(Set) you see in the error).
But you screw up a little, and instead of editing the existing, raw toList() method, you add a new method like this:
It is not a limitation required by the erasure of type parameters; because method resolution occurs at compile-time, adding generic types to the method identifier would have been sufficient.
Define a single Method without type like void add(Set ii){}
Or with some more descriptive names, self-documenting for oyu cases, like addNames and addIndexes or such.
The simple-and-direct approach is to create and add a new style node to the document.
YUI just recently [added a utility (hyper-link)] specifically for this.
You can add classes or style attributes on an element by element basis.
Here's my general-purpose function which parametrizes the CSS selector and rules, and optionally takes in a css filename (case-sensitive) if you wish to add to a particular sheet instead (otherwise, if you don't provide a CSS filename, it will create a new style element and append it to the existing head.

This is my solution to add a css rule at the end of the last style sheet list:

When I've done this, rather than fiddling the original migration, I create a new one with just the add column in the up section and a drop column in the down section.
As currently posted, you're adding the column and then creating the table.
Or, as you're modifying an existing migration, just add it to the create table instead of doing a separate add column.
If you have already run your original migration (before editing it), then you need to generate a new migration (rails generate migration add_email_to_users email:string will do the trick).
It will create a migration file containing line:
add_column :users, email, string
Then do a rake db:migrate and it'll run the new migration, creating the new column.
Your migration code is almost perfect: you just need to remove the add_column line completely (that code is trying to add a column to a table, before the table has been created, and your table creation code has already been updated to include a t.string :email anyway).
if you have not added any data to the tables.Then edit the migration file by adding the email column to it and then call
To add a column I just had to follow these steps :
rails generate migration add_fieldname_to_tablename fieldname:string
Alternative
rails generate migration addFieldnameToTablename
Once the migration is generated, then edit the migration and define all the attributes you want that column added to have.
Example using one of the steps mentioned previously- 
rails generate migration addEmailToUsers
You can change the schema in from db/schema.rb, Add the columns you want in the SQL query.
You can also do this ..
  rails g migration add_column_to_users email:string
then rake db:migrate
  also add :email attribute in your user controller ;
Sometimes rails generate migration add_email_to_users email:string produces a migration like this
In that case you have to manually an [add_column (hyper-link)] to change:
You also can use special [change_table (hyper-link)] method in the migration for adding new columns:
You can also add column to a specific position using before column or after column like:
you need to add after: :email or before: :email
You also need to explicitly add the new version of the submodule in the main project.
It would be cool to have an automated iteration through each submodule, updating the parent repository pointer (using git add) to point to the head of the submodule(s).
Then some submodule initializing, might be necessary, if new submodules have been added or are not initialized yet:
This list of relative submodule paths is captured in an array ($(...)) - finally iterate this and do git add $i to update the parent repository.
When calling submodule helper, adding "--" in front of "git pull" will
stop parseopt for parsing options that do not really belong to
submodule--helper foreach.
While at it, I also add "--" to other subcommands that pass "$@" to
submodule--helper.
This commit fixes the problem by adding the double dash in front of the subcommand during the recursion.
the simplest way to handle git projects containing submodules is to always add
First add the directory to be included:
Then you also must add the header files to the list of your source files for the current target, for instance:
First, you use include_directories() to tell CMake to add the directory as -I to the compilation command line.
Second, you list the headers in your add_executable() or add_library() call.
Crude [include_directories (hyper-link)] will append a directory to the current project and all other descendant projects which you will append via a series of [add_subdirectory (hyper-link)] commands.
A similar answer is with other pairs of commands [target_compile_definitions (hyper-link)]/[add_definitions (hyper-link)],  [target_compile_options (hyper-link)]/[CMAKE_C_FLAGS (hyper-link)]
Add include_directories("/your/path/here").
4.The src/CMakeLists.txt file adds further subdirectories, which in turn contain CMakeLists.txt files.

Since we often focus on changing View's color in normal and pressed state, I'm going to add more details:
Note that you add colors  in res/values/color.xml
and include the attribute in your fab
add colors in color.xml file and then add this line of code...
floatingActionButton.setBackgroundTintList(ColorStateList.valueOf(getResources().getColor(R.color.fab2_color)));
for Material design, I just changed the floating action button color like this,
Add the below two lines in your Floating action button xml.
The solution is to find a different approach to the problem you are trying to address this way.
You need to have a div parent that takes the padding and the :after.
[Here's another approach (hyper-link)] (assuming you have control of the HTML): add an empty <span></span> right after the input, and target that in CSS using input.mystyle + span:after
I'm using this approach in AngularJS because it will add .ng-invalid classes automatically to <input> form elements, and to the form, but not to the <label>.
Adding a reference to this System.Runtime.dll assembly fixed the issue:
Adding the missing references as suggested in other answers also solves the problem, but the error remains solved even after you remove the references again.
Once expanded, I then added the following new configuration XML as I was instructed:
I installed a nuGet package of System Runtime and added the reference from
packages\System.Runtime.4.3.0\ref\net462\System.Runtime.dll
Removing the reference over the Nuget Package Manager and re-adding it solved the problem for me.
The only way that worked for me - add the assembly to web.config
i added System.Runtime.dll to bin project and it worked :)
You must add a reference to assembly 'System.Runtime, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'.
You must add a reference to assembly 'System.Runtime, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'.
Apparently a new package added to our project was referencing an older version of the .NET Framework, causing the "definition in multiple assemblies" issue (CS1685), which led to the razor view compiler error at runtime.
Adding
Adding the proposed <Reference solved the build error, at the price of a missing reference warning (yellow triangle on the added entry in the references tree) in Visual Studio.
install [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49978 (hyper-link)]  Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6.1 Developer Pack and add this line of code in Web.config file
After that, you can add elements to it:
You need to use append to add elements to the end of the list.
This is an old thread, but just adding this for completeness.
To add something to a list, use list.append()
If it's full, ie got 10 items then adding another item results in item @index 0 being discarded.
You can use a <para /> tag to produce a paragraph break or you can wrap text in <para></para> tags as a way to group the text and add the blank line after it, but there is no equivalent to <br /> or anything like that.
Add a <para> tag with a special char in it, the 255 char, or [invisible char (hyper-link)].
Notice that there is no extra line added when we use <br/> instead of <para>.
It automatically removes any prior defaults on the column, before adding the new default.
If you attempt to add a default to a column when one already exists, you will get the following error (something you will never see if using this stored proc):
alter table TableName
 add constraint DF_TableName_WhenEntered
 default getutcdate() for WhenEntered
To add new items to a plain object use this syntax:
Then you can add elements using push().
This allows you to add multiple items to the cart like so:
then add object to the new index of element
Notice the elements are added with indexes and also see that there is a new length property added to the object.This will be useful to find the length of the object too.This works because of the generic nature of push() function
Adding new key/pair elements into the original object:
In case anyone else needs this, I finally found a good way to add objects or arrays of objects:
$ git remote add RepoName RepoURL
usage: git remote add []
Now Push to remote
$git add .
----> Add all the files and folder as git staged'
$git commit -m "Your Commit Message"  - - - >Commit the message
$git push  - - - - >Push the changes to the upstream
This can be further automated by adding above sed command to a makefile.
You can add any attributes using {[attr]="[prop]"}
You could change the regexp exceptions with adding more extension in (?!html?|php3?|aspx?)
The code is compatible with IE8+ and you can add it to the bottom of your page.
Just make sure that the target attribute is passed first, if there are additional attributes in the link, copy/paste them to the end of the reference URL.
That effectively adds a default target to every anchor element.
So, it isn't quite true that you cannot add link attributes to a Markdown URL.
To add attributes, check with the underlying markdown parser being used and what their extensions are.
If you are using [GatsbyJS (hyper-link)] there is a plugin that automatically adds target="_blank" to external links in your markdown.
yarn add gatsby-remark-external-links
In your code, juste add:
There is an easy way to add constraints quickly (example):
Add a new item to it:
If you want to add new items from another hash - use merge method:
but it's not wise to use it when you should to add just one element more.
The following function adds months to a date in JavaScript ([source (hyper-link)]).
Add twelve months to February 29th 2020 (should be February 28th 2021)
Add one month to August 31st 2020 (should be September 30th 2020)
The following is an example of how to calculate a future date based on date input (membershipssignup_date) + added months (membershipsmonths) via form fields.
As above stated method, you can add month to Date function.
Just to add on to the accepted answer and the comments.
As most of the answers highlighted, we could use [setMonth() (hyper-link)] method together with [getMonth() (hyper-link)] method to add specific number of months to a given date.
Example: (as mentioned by @ChadD in his answer. )
All these seem way too complicated and I guess it gets into a debate about what exactly adding "a month" means.
If the latter, then adding a month to Feb 27th gets you to March 27th, but adding a month to Feb 28th gets you to March 31st (except in leap years, where it gets you to March 28th).
For those looking for a simple solution, just add milliseconds and be done.
Sample code to add one month:
where X is the number of months we want to add.
For adding prefix or suffix for files(directories), you could use the simple and powerful way by xargs:
It finds all the HTML files recursively and adds prefix_ in front of their names:
To add a prefix to all files and folders in the current directory using util-linux's rename (as opposed to prename, the perl variant from Debian and certain other systems), you can do:
If you insist on using arrays, you can use [java.util.Arrays.copyOf (hyper-link)] to allocate a bigger array to accomodate the additional element.
but then this is a fixed size and no elements can be added.
and you want to add some elements to it like numbers please us StringBuilder which is much more efficient than concatenating string.
you can create a arraylist, and use Collection.addAll() to convert the string array to your arraylist
Adding new items to String array.
There are many ways to add an element to an array.
If you are using DB generated Ids (like IDENTITY in MS SQL) you just need to add entity to ObjectSet and SaveChanges on related ObjectContext.
When I added a new customer and a new order at the same time I was doing something like this;
Now when I save the changes the id that is generated for customer is also added to order.
I've no need for the additional steps
The problem is if you create a table and add the
part later, future update-databases won't add back the (newsequentialid())
To fix the proper way is to wipe migration, delete database and re-migrate... or you can just add (newsequentialid()) into the table designer.
All answers are very well suited for their own scenarios, what i did different is that i  assigned the int PK directly from object (TEntity) that Add() returned to an int variable like this;
You might be able to work around that problem, and apply the rule by referring to it, via addClass():
I would assume you tried it without adding !important?
Inline CSS (which is how JavaScript adds styling) overrides the stylesheet CSS.
My issue was that I had already set !important for the width in my CSS to avoid conflicts with other theme CSS, but any changes I made to the width in jQuery would be unaffected since they would be added to the style attribute.
Another easy method to solve this issue adding the style attribute:
I also discovered that certain elements or add-on's (like Bootstrap) have some special class cases where they do not play well with !important or other work-arounds like .addClass/.removeClass, and thus you have to to toggle them on/off.
Using "cssText" as the property name and whatever you want added to the CSS as its value.
Instead of using the css() function try the addClass() function:
The easiest and best solution for this problem from me was to simply use addClass() instead of .css() or .attr().
$('#elem').addClass('importantClass');
We can use setProperty or cssText to add !important to a DOM element using JavaScript.
Last step: Apply this class using the addClass method as follows:
The safest workaround to this is to add a class and then do the magic in CSS :-), addClass() and removeClass() should do the work.
This solution will leave all the computed javascript and add the important tag into the element:
You can do (Ex if you need to set the width with the important tag)
The [API docs on link_to (hyper-link)] show some examples of adding querystrings to both named and oldstyle routes.

[code snippet]
In Quake's case, one iteration is "good enough", but if it wasn't for you... then you could add as much iteration as you need.
[code snippet]
The idea is that at each iteration, you add one bit onto r, the "current" square root of x; each square root is accurate modulo a larger and larger power of 2, namely t/2.
It was easy to fix by adding one to the original argument before computing the error.
(Add two for cube roots, etc.)
Additional mod-255 test
However, this simple line, which most of the time adds one or two very fast instructions, greatly simplifies the switch-case statement into one if statement.
However, it can add to the runtime if many of the tested numbers have significant power-of-two factors.
Depending on how many dynamic classes you need to add as your project grows it's probably worth checking out the [classnames (hyper-link)] utility by JedWatson on GitHub.
Also add import statement :
and add this in className attribute :
to add class :
Additionally, if the class appears in more than one element with the same logic, then the solution would be extracting that logic to a method or function.
The easier way is to do it in the GUI, but if this isn't an option, you can go the long way around of copying the data, dropping the column, re-adding it with identity, and putting the data back.
you can't do it like that, you need to add another column, drop the original column and rename the new column or or create a new table, copy the data in and drop the old table followed by renaming the new table to the old table
The trick also works even if the identity column is a primary key, is part of a clustered or non-clustered index, or other gotchas which can trip up the the simpler "add/remove/rename column" solution.
The same trick works to add IDENTITY to an existing column.
Adding/removing columns, changing nullability, etc.
UPDATE - [Eric Wu (hyper-link)] had a comment below that adds important info about this solution.
If the table is actively being extended with new rows (meaning you don't have much if any downtime between adding IDENTITY and adding new rows, then instead of DBCC CHECKIDENT you'll want to manually set the identity seed value in the new table schema to be larger than the largest existing ID in the table, e.g.
Obviously, if no new rows are being added to the table (or they're only added occasionally, like a daily ETL process) then this race condition won't happen so DBCC CHECKIDENT is fine.
There is cool solution described here:
[SQL SERVER – Add or Remove Identity Property on Column (hyper-link)]
Although this post is old and I am making an assumption about the requestors need, I felt this additional information could be helpful to users encountering this thread as I believe the conversation could lead one to believe that an existing column can not be set to be a primary key without adding it as a new column first which would be incorrect.
Create a duplicate, identical new table, except add an identity field on the PK field where it had been before.
--Add the PK to the new table.
--Add the FK to the new table.
--Add the FK's back to the dependency table.
Then add a new column using alter query to set as primary key and identity value
Now we've adding a primarykey and identity to the existing column on the table.
Add new column 'EmployeeId_new' in the 'Employee' table 

ALTER TABLE Employee ADD EmployeeId_new INT IDENTITY(1,1)
Now Column 'EmployeeId' removed from table 
So we will Rename the newly added new column 'EmployeeId_new' with 'EmployeeId'

sp_rename 'Employee.EmployeeId', 'EmployeeId_new', 'COLUMN'
To rearrange the table in the same form as It was, we have to add Primary Key Constraint for the column 'EmployeeId'

ALTER TABLE Employee add constraint [PK_dbo.Employee] primary key  (EmployeeId)
I used this links : [https://blog.sqlauthority.com/2014/10/11/sql-server-add-auto-incremental-identity-column-to-table-after-creating-table/ (hyper-link)]
[Add primary key to existing table (hyper-link)]
You can add Identity constraint here in 'Column Properties'.
Add the modifier "IDENTITY" to your column
If you need to add multiple then you can do it like this:
If target element hasn't style attribute, you can use this method to add inline style to element.
You can add specific CSS property to element using pure javascript, if you don't want to use jQuery.
I have added an explanation to understand what the heck is going on.
Add all Files for version control with

git add .
git commit -m 'AddingBaseCode'

Step 6: add, commit and push all the files and folders of your project.
It's notable to understand that if you'd like to conditionally add attributes you can also add a dynamic declaration:
You can add colon before attribute (also can use conditions) like
If you're not on Servlet 3.1 yet, then you need an additional utility method to obtain the submitted file name.
You need the common-io.1.4.jar file to be included in your lib directory, or if you're working in any editor, like NetBeans, then you need to go to project properties and just add the JAR file and you will be done.
I added the source code for commons-fileupload and commons-io into my Eclipse project to trace the actual error and finally got some insight.
And then, in the Servlet "Controller" add the Annotation for a Multi-part to indicate multipart data is processed in the servlet.
You can add these columns by specifying the column types manually:
While this does not have the same terse syntax as the add_timestamps method you have specified above, Rails will still treat these columns as timestamp columns, and update the values normally.
I made a simple function that you can call to add to each table (assuming you have a existing database) the created_at and updated_at fields:
For those who don't use Rails but do use activerecord, the following also adds a column to an existing model, example is for an integer field.
I then used the gem [migration_data (hyper-link)] to add the time for current projects on the migration such as:
So when you add timestamps with null: false, which is the default and often desirable, those existing records are all invalid.
But I think that answer can be improved upon, by combining the two steps into one migration, as well as using the more semantic add_timestamps method:
add_timestamps(table_name, options = {}) public
Adds timestamps (created_at and updated_at) columns to table_name.
Additional options (like null: false) are forwarded to #add_column.
[Nick Davies answer (hyper-link)] is the most complete in terms of adding timestamp columns to a table with existing data.
As some have noted, #add_timestamps unfortunately adds the null: false restriction, which will cause old rows to be invalid because they don't have these values populated.
I don't see the value in adding incorrect data to the table.
I was able to add the timestamp columns manually with the following:
class AddTimestampsToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_timestamps :users, default: -> { 'now()' }, null: false
  end
end
This is a simple one to add timestamp in existing table.
First, create a style.xml in values folder and add a style to it.
Second, in your app Manifest.xml add android:theme="@style/splashScreenTheme" to your main activity.

Just make sure there's a file in the folder like doc/foo.txt and run git add doc or git add doc/foo.txt, and the folder will be added to your local repository once you've committed (and appear on GitHub once you've pushed it).
Then you can create local folders and files inside your local_directory, and add them to the repository using:
You can also add everything using:
First we need to add files to the directory.
Then commit those added files.
git add app/ config/
Original answer
You cannot create an empty folder and then add files to that folder, but rather creation of a folder must happen together with adding of at least a single file.
You can add more folders similarly
To add a new directory all you have to do is create a new folder in your local repository.
Create a new folder, and add a file in it.
Now go to your terminal and add it like you add the normal files in Git.
2)Click create Add file and then create a new file.
3)Give the folder name you want to create with a ' / ' mark and then add a file in it

Instead of adding the changes you make to resolve the conflict, you can use git reset HEAD file to resolve the conflict without staging your changes.
With this command GIT will try to apply the changes as they were before, without trying to add all of them for commit.
You don't have to execute git add before.
There are two ways of marking conflicts as resolved: git add and git restore --staged <file>....
While git restore --staged <file>... marks the conflicts as resolved and removes files from the index, git add also marks the conflicts as resolved, but keeps files in the index.
Adding files to the index after a conflict is resolved is on purpose.
According to [git stash questions (hyper-link)], after fixing the conflict, git add <file> is the right course of action.
It was after reading [this comment (hyper-link)] that I understood that the changes are automatically added to the index (by design).
That's why git add <file> completes the conflict resolution process.
The fastest way I have found is to resolve the conflict, then do git add -u, and then do git reset HEAD, that doesn't even involve a commit.
git add .
This allows an additional string to be attached to the label of an edge.
The solution you have provided doesn't add a padding for your views inside your UIStackView (as you wanted in the question), but it adds a leading for the UIStackView.
A solution could be to add another UIStackView inside your original UIStackView and give the leading to this new UIStackVIew.
Then, add your views to this new UIStackView.
If you want this padding for only one arranged view, you need to use nested UIStackView
What worked for me is to add to stack view another UIView that's just a spacer (works at least with stackView.distribution = .Fill):
(Such as if I add leading/trailing constraint to selected on image stackview, that adds leading to collectionview too, but doesn't add trailing; and it be conflict for sure).
Then add your padding:
If you only need leading padding, then you can set the stack view's Alignment to "Trailing" and then you will be free to specify unique Leading constraints on each of its contained subviews.
As a bonus, you can also set the stack view's alignment to "Center" and then you can use Leading and/or Trailing constraints to give each item its own padding on both sides.
Be sure this constraint set after you parentView.addArrangdSubView(firstView)
What we did was add transparent components (e.g., UIButton/UIView) as the first and last children of the UIStackView.
Then set constrain the width of these invisible children to adjust the padding.
For first and last views there can be two options, either set insets as @tolpp suggested or add constraint attaching to parent (stackview) with constant to add padding.
The solution would be to have a regular view in the stack view to hold whatever views you are wanting to add constraints to, and then you can add constraints for your items that are relative to the views in the stack view.
Just add an empty view at the beginning of the stack view (also constraining its width and/or height):
I created this simple UIView extension to add the constraints:
Put your JAR in app/libs, and in app/build.gradle add in the dependencies section:
Create "libs" folder in app directory copy your jar file in libs folder right click on your jar file in Android Studio and Add As library... 
Then open build.gradle and add this:
Add your jar file to the folder app/libs.
Then right click the jar file and click "add as library".
The GUI based approach would be to add an additional module in your project.
Add a dependency to the module that you created in step 4.
Add jars to libs folder from Project view … create lib folder if not exists
Add libs to gradle.... in build.gradle file :

The Gradle answer is to add a jar/manifest/attributes setting like this:
If you are using the command line to assemble .jar it is possible to point to the main without adding Manifest file.
If you want to have your .class files in packages, add the package in the beginning of the .java.

Simply add this to your java module's build.gradle.
I added this into the parent pom.xml, which caused the issue.
I fixed the issue by adding the same configuration to the modules that i wanted to be packaged as a jar, but changed the value of skip to false:
[List<T>.Add (hyper-link)] adds a single element.
Instead, use [List<T>.AddRange (hyper-link)] to add multiple values.
Additionally, List<T>.AddRange takes an IEnumerable<T>, so you don't need to convert tripDetails into a List<TripDetails>, you can pass it directly, e.g.
(To clarify/correct what I meant in the comment, you don't need the git add ., since commit -a usually serves the same purpose - adding any changes that have not yet been staged, if the files have already been added)
If the file is already being tracked then you do not need to run git add, you can simply write git commit -am 'your message'
I have added the following to my .bashrc (or .bash_profile if Mac):
git config --global alias.acpp '!git add -A && branchatu="$(git
  symbolic-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)" && branchatu=${branchatu##refs/heads/}
  && git commit -m "$1" && shift && git pull -u origin $branchatu && git
  push -u origin $branchatu'
I ended up adding an alias to my .gitconfig file:
Adds all files, then uses the comment for the commit message and pushes it up to origin.
The alias can be also defined from command line, this adds it to your .gitconfig:
This goes in the eshell alias file, which might be in ~/.emacs.d/eshell/alias   I've added the first part z [https://github.com/rupa/z/ (hyper-link)]  which let's you quickly cd to a directory, so that this can be run no matter what your current directory is.
Add in ~/.bash_profile for adding, committing and pushing with one command put:
There's also a function for adding and committing in a similar way:
You can also add an alias for pushing to the remote:
Building off the [lazygit (hyper-link)] answer, the following solution adds a user check to verify the changes before pushing.
Changes will now be added, committed, and push :).
git add is already contained in -a parameter of commit, but if you want you can connect them all:
..to add all files, commit them, and push them.
(I also added the "-u" because I like to do this anyway, even though it's not related to this issue.
I like this approach because it also allows to to use "git put" without adding all the files (skip the "-a"), or with any other options I might want to pass to commit.
Write a small script named gitpush.sh with below lines and add it your ~ directory.
Now add an alias in ~/.bashrc like below :
[This Result (hyper-link)]
- Try this: Simple script one command for git add, git commit and git push
default gitall will add all in current git repo
will add certain file to change, and use custom commit message
After this, restart your terminal and simply add, commit and push in one easy command, example:
Please see my answer,I added everything into a single line
You can do two things to add animations, first you can let android animate layout changes for you.
Your second option would be to manually add animations.
Try adding this line to the xml parent layout
By design there isn't a built in mechanism for Windows to propagate an environment variable add/change/remove to an already running cmd.exe, either from another cmd.exe or from "My Computer -> Properties ->Advanced Settings -> Environment Variables".
If you modify or add a new environment variable outside of the scope of an existing open command prompt you either need to restart the command prompt, or, manually add using SET in the existing command prompt.
ADDED
In my example I did an install using a Batch file that added new environment variables.
To programmatically add or modify system environment variables, add
  them to the
  HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
  Manager\Environment registry key, then broadcast a WM_SETTINGCHANGE
  message with lParam set to the string "Environment".
I played around with using VirtualAllocEx to allocate additional memory in the target process for the environment storage, and was able to set and read an entirely new table.
Unfortunately any attempt to modify the environment from normal means will crash and burn as the address no longer points to the heap (it will crash in RtlSizeHeap).
The easiest way to add a variable to the path without rebooting for the current session is to open the command prompt and type:
I use this Powershell script to add to the PATH variable.
In order to force your attribute to be returned in the array, add it as a key to the $attributes array.
Any attributes listed in the $appends property will automatically be included in the array or JSON form of the model, provided that you've added the appropriate accessor.
That can be used automatically to add new accessors to the model without any additional work like modifying methods like ::toArray().
Just create getFooBarAttribute(...) accessor and add the foo_bar to  $appends array.
you can use setAttribute function in Model to add a custom attribute
The above basically will add a large-video css class to the div element if video.large is truthy.
Adding the flag to CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS is redundant.
Suppose you want to add those flags (better to declare them in a constant):
There are several ways to add them:
As of CMake 3.13 you can also use [target_link_options (hyper-link)] to add linker options which makes the intent more clear.
You can also add linker flags to a specific target using the LINK_FLAGS property:
GCC on GNU/Linux or MSVC on Windows) without any additional flags.
Steps to add a toolchain:
To add class to a element
The classList property ensures that duplicate classes are not unnecessarily added to the element.
In order to keep this functionality, if you dislike the longhand versions or jQuery version, I'd suggest adding an addMany function and removeMany to DOMTokenList (the type of classList):
The standard definiton allows only for adding or deleting a single class.
Newer versions of the [DOMTokenList spec (hyper-link)] allow for multiple arguments to add() and remove(), as well as a second argument to toggle() to force state.
At the time of writing, Chrome supports multiple arguments to add() and remove(), but none of the other browsers do.
I liked @rich.kelly's answer, but I wanted to use the same nomenclature as classList.add() (comma seperated strings), so a slight deviation.
Should we be checking for something more specific than the existence of DOMTokenList.prototype.addMany?
What exactly causes classList.add() to fail in IE11?
I include that script and use element.classList.add("first","second","third") as it's intended.
Since the add() method from the classList just allows to pass separate arguments and not a single array, you need to invoque add() using apply.
For the first argument you will need to pass the classList reference from the same DOM node and as a second argument the array of classes that you want to add:
Assume that you have an array of classes to being added, you can use ES6 spread syntax:

let classes = ['first', 'second', 'third'];
elem.classList.add(...classes);
Call it like this:
removeAddClasses(node.classList,arrayToRemove,arrayToAdd);
...and arrayToAdd is an array of class names to add:
['myClass3','myClass4'] etcetera
Add
A better way to add the multiple classes separated by spaces in a string is using the [Spread_syntax (hyper-link)] with the [split (hyper-link)]:
One of the best solution is to check if an element exists and then proceed to add or possibly remove and above all if the element is empty, delete it.
Suppose you have a table named test1, to which you want to add an auto-incrementing, primary-key id (surrogate) column.
Add the id column
I added the serial column at the end of my target table.
The reason 'addPane' is assigned to this is because of the <pane> directive.
addPane is assigned to this so that the pane link function can see it.
Then in the pane link function, addPane is just a property of the tabs controller, and it's just tabsControllerObject.addPane.
So the pane directive's linking function can access the tabs controller object and therefore access the addPane method.
So in the "tabs" controller constructor function, when the addPane function is created
Views cannot see the addPane function -- they only have access to functions defined on $scope.
The addPane() function's "scope" (I'm referring to JavaScript's function scope/closures here) gives the function access to the tabs isolate $scope.
I.e., addPane() has access to the "tabs IsolateScope" in the diagram above because of a closure that was created when addPane() was defined.
(If we instead defined addPane() on the tabs $scope object, the pane directive would not have access to this function, and hence it would have no way to communicate with the tabs $scope.)
you can add:
If you add method to the controller through "this" method, you have to call it in the view with controller's name "dot" your property or method.
$scope has a different 'this' then the controller 'this'.Thus if you put a console.log(this) inside controller it gives you a object(controller) and this.addPane() adds addPane Method to the controller Object.
this.methodName() inside controller means to add methos inside controller object.$scope.functionName() is in HTML and inside
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP PRIMARY KEY,ADD PRIMARY KEY (col_name1, col_name2);
ALTER IGNORE TABLE table_name ADD UNIQUES INDEX idx_name(some_id, another_id, one_more_id);
Add it in two steps, and it's good to make it unsigned too:
I think I also had to add in $table->engine = 'InnoDB';
So adding a ->nullable() to the new column did the trick.
For making addition of foreign key constraint in laravel, the following worked for me:
Adding the constraint  line immediately after (1) i.e.
We cannot add relations, unless related tables gets created.
In following laracasts, and in reading these posts, I believe the correct answer is similar to Vickies answer, with the exception that you don't need to add a separate schema call.
Alternatively or in addition, Lower the datecode for tables that don't need foreign keys.
how it can add relation to a table that does not exist!.
and add to a new migration file, here its name is create_prioritiesForeignKey_table and add these codes:
your pointer principal key must be add unsigned method, let me show:
The way I solved it is by adding primary keys "$table->bigIncrements('id')" to every single table that is related to the table "users" and its associations, in my case the table "role".
You can fix this by just adding InnoDB at the end of your table creation like so:
I had this issue with laravel 5.8 and i fixed this code, as shown [here in Laravel documentation (hyper-link)], to where ever i am adding a foreign key.
Since this syntax is rather verbose, Laravel provides additional, terser methods that use convention to provide a better developer experience.
In your code is just delete the column user_id and add the foreignId on the reference:
if first table id type is bigint then while adding foreign key check the type should be bigint in other table.
It is easy, just overload has_add_permission method in your Admin class like so:
Create (aka add)
In additon to the above as posted by
Note: many of these options have already been covered in other answers: [Add multiple columns to DataFrame and set them equal to an existing column (hyper-link)], [Is it possible to add several columns at once to a pandas DataFrame?
(hyper-link)], [Add multiple empty columns to pandas DataFrame (hyper-link)]
if adding a lot of missing columns (a, b, c ,....) with the same value, here 0, i did this:
If you just want to add empty new columns, [reindex (hyper-link)] will do the job
Using a Dockerfile with the ADD instruction, you can inject it during your build process
You need to add
I'm trying to work the problem the other way: adding public ssh key to an image.
Check this out for more details: [http://docs.docker.io/reference/builder/#add (hyper-link)]
The ssh key remains stored within the image, even if you remove the key in a layer command after adding it (see comments in [this post (hyper-link)]).
Since you can't add/copy any file outside the dockerfile context, which means it's impossible to just link ~/.ssh/id_rsa into image's /root/.ssh/id_rsa, and when you definitely need a key to do some sshed thing like git clone from a private repo link..., during the building of your docker image.
in your dockerfile:

add this file as /root/.ssh/id_rsa
do what you want, such as git clone, composer...
rm /root/.ssh/id_rsa at the end
anytime you have to run a container from this image with some ssh requirements, just add -v for the run command, like:
docker run -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa:/root/.ssh/id_rsa --name container image command
The solution I found is to add your keys using the --build-arg flag.
Then you can use the new experimental --squash command (added 1.13) to merge the layers so that the keys are no longer available after removal.
Unfortunately, I'm on docker 1.9, so --squash option is not there yet, eventually it needs to be added
An additional upside is that it works with a non-root user too and will get you connected to GitHub.
You can do this publishing to the container's environment some additional variables:
We generate a pre-sign URL to access the key with aws s3 cli, and limit the access for about 5 minutes, we save this pre-sign URL into a file in repo directory, then in dockerfile we add it to the image.
In order to avoid further SSH key passphrase prompts it is automatically added to ssh-agent.
As one of the steps in your Dockerfile, create a .ssh directory by adding:
RUN mkdir -p /root/.ssh
Ensure that your container's ssh_config knows where to find the public keys by adding this line: 
RUN  echo "    IdentityFile /root/.ssh/id_rsa" >> /etc/ssh/ssh_config
Expose you local user's .ssh directory to the container at runtime:
docker run -v ~/.ssh:/root/.ssh -it image_name
Or in your dockerCompose.yml add this under the service's volume key:
- "~/.ssh:/root/.ssh"
I was trying to figure out how to add signing keys to a container to use during runtime (not build) and came across this question.
Docker secrets seem to be the solution for my use case, and since nobody has mentioned it yet I'll add it.
And you need to add the --ssh default parameter to docker build.
[Docker Secrets (hyper-link)] (Cross-platform, adds complexity)
The drawback here is additional complexity due to the machinery required to create and manage a keystore such as [Vault by HashiCorp (hyper-link)].
Create a docker-compose.env file and add it to your .gitignore file.
Update your docker-compose.yml and add [env_file (hyper-link)] for service requiring the key.
Additional resources:
I fixed it added 'node' user to nodejs container and 700 to ~/.ssh in container.
add env attribute in your compose file:
So instead of executing the swift build command (or whatever build command is relevant to your environment) directly in the docker run command, we instead execute the build-init.sh script which starts the ssh-agent, then adds our ssh key to the agent, and finally executes our swift build command.
Note 1: For this to work you'll need to make sure your ssh key does not have a passphrase, otherwise the ssh-add /root/.ssh/id_rsa line will ask for a passphrase and interrupt the build script.
Use COPY or ADD instead.
We see here that FROM is just a namespace, it is like a header for the lines below it and can be addressed with an alias.
The final readable comment of the public key string (normally your computer name if you did not add a -C comment in the parameters of ssh-keygen) is not important, just leave it there.
Quoting [a user's (hyper-link)] comment:

If anyone gets a hold of your
image, they can retrieve the key... even if you delete that file in a
later layer, b/c they can go back to Step 7 when you added it

The attacker could wait with this private key until you use the key pair again.
Add some functions - the singleton's 'methods'.
If you want to run __init__ every time the class is called, add
I originally was writing a comment but it was too long, so I'll add this here.
It also prevents you from creating additional instances by doing type(MySingleton)() (that also returns the same instance).
Additional thing to consider is to make sure that deserialization isn't creating any other instances.
By default, when you add a file to a repository, Git will try to honor its filesystem attributes and set the correct filemode accordingly.
:-)  I just want to add that in Git, file permissions are recorded only1 as either 644 or 755 (spelled (100644 and 100755; the 100 part means "regular file"):
Then add your new remote repo:
Ensure you create the new remote first, using bitbucket/github GUI, but don’t add any files to it or there will be a merge problem.
So you'll not be able to add origin, but you need to use set-url.
This has the advantage over using concat() of adding elements to the array in place rather than creating a new array.
... or add it to Array's prototype:
Then, Array.prototype.push has to additionally allocate more memory each time, and (for some browser implementations) maybe even recalculate some position-lookup data for sparseness.
Can you increase the padding?
That will add 4px of vertical spacing between each row.
add this style before the class="highlighted"
padding-bottom and
display is inline-table
add a div to the cells that you would like to add some extra spacing:
The downside is however, that it adds some extra whitespace after the last cell.
This will add a tr after every tr, if you have so many trs like me.
Because margin is ignored on tr, I usually use a workaround, by setting a transparent border-bottom or border-top and setting the background-clip property to padding-box so the background-color does not get painted underneath the border.
A way to mimic the margin on the row would be to use the pseudo selector to add some spacing on the td.
Although margin doesn't work, padding does work :
You can create space between table rows by adding an empty row of cells like this...
For what is worth, I took advantage that I was already using bootstrap (4.3), because I needed to add margin, box-shadow and border-radius to my row, something I can't do with tables.
On css I added a few lines to mantain the table behavior of bootstrap
Add labels to each argument in your plot call corresponding to the series it is graphing, i.e.
Then simply add Pyplot.legend() to the bottom of your script and the legend will display these labels.
Add a label= to each of your [plot() (hyper-link)] calls, and then call [legend(loc='upper left') (hyper-link)].
You can add a custom legend [documentation (hyper-link)]
Add a new record to a frame
If you are adding rows inside a loop consider performance issues.
Open src/app/app.module.ts and add:

Then, open your angular-cli-build.js and add this line:
As per their document, you can take following steps to add Bootstrap library.
Then add the needed script files to to apps[0].scripts in angular-cli.json file:
Finally add the Bootstrap CSS to the apps[0].styles array:
You can also watch this video by Mike Brocchi which has useful information on how to add bootstrap to your Angular-Cli generated project.
After add these lines in your angular-cli.json (angular.json from version 6 onwards) file
This will add bootstrap 4 to your project.
For scripts you will still have to add the file in the angular-cli.json  file like so (In Angular version 6, this edit needs to be done in the file angular.json):
open src/app/app.module.ts and add
open src/app/app.component.html and test all works by adding
Add/Change the following in angular-cli.json
"styles": [
    "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
  ],
  "scripts": [
    "../node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js",
    "../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js"
    ],
Add code to .angular-cli.json:
[code snippet]
Last add bootstrap.css to your code style.scss
[code snippet]
This guide will walk you through adding bootstrap to your Angular CLI project and configuring it to use bootstrap.
Open app.component.html and add the following markup:
If you are using bootstrap-sass, add the following to _variables.scss:
In styles.scss add the following:
Open app.component.html and add the following markup:
To ensure your variables are used open _variables.scss and add the following:
TLDR, install bootstrap via npm and add the styles link to "styles" section in your .angular-cli.json file
2.add to .angular-cli.json
And in your .angular-cli.json, add to styles section:
Add this to your main module class.
add this path | import boostrap within style.css or style.scss
Add Bootstrap to Project
4.1 open .angular-cli.json
4.2 find the "styles" section in the json
4.3 add the bootstrap css path as below
.
Now you have succesfully added the bootstrap css in angular 5 project
add bootstrap button component
Note : 
 if you added bootstrap path after ng serve , you must stop and rerun the ng serve to reflect the changes
3.Goto angular.json in Angular 6 project / .angular-cli.json in Angular 5 and add the listed:
Install bootstrap using npm i -S bootstrap or yarn add bootstrap.
Just add these three lines in Head tag in index.html
Step1:
npm install bootstrap@latest --save-dev
This will install the latest version of the bootstrap, 
However, the specified version can be installed by adding the version number
Step2: Open styles.css and add the following
    @import "~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css"
I just added this line in style.scss
In my case i also wanted to override bootstrap variables.
For Adding Bootstrap and Jquery both
after running this command, please go ahead and check your node_modules folder you should be able to see bootstrap and jquery added into it.
Add node package of bootstrap as dev dependency
You have many ways to [add Bootstrap 4 in your Angular project (hyper-link)]:
Adding the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files in the styles and scripts arrays of the angular.json file of your project
You can try to add the following link tag at top and script tags at the bottom in your app.component.html.
Import into your project, add below line in your styles.scss
Add this in your styles.css file
"If you have an Angular ≥ 9 CLI project, you could simply use our schematics to add ng-bootstrap library to it."
All the configurations will be automatically added.
ng add @ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap
So, Angular uses webpack, therefore, in your app.module.ts, just add:
Then to your styles.scss, add:
Additionally, if you tried to edit some request headers manually, like origin-header from the developers tools that come with the browsers, the browser will refuse your edit and may send a preflight OPTIONS request.
And add the header field in your Ajax call.
Try to add 'Content-Type':'application/json':
A fix for this problem is to add swap (i.e.
To add this extra space to your instance you type:
To enable it by default after reboot, add this line to /etc/fstab:
You can add a 1 GB swap to your instance with these commands:
To enable it by default after reboot, add this line to /etc/fstab:
Add/Make sure the following are in your /etc/fstab
We can add swap space in any server
You can use the following script to add swap on Amazon Linux.
All you need to do is add data-clipboard-target="#toCopyElement" on any button, initialize it new Clipboard('.btn'); and it will copy the content of DOM with id toCopyElement to clipboard.
For example, if you want to add a click event to a Component, you have to use Renderer and ElementRef (this gives you as well the option to use ViewChild, or anything that retrieves the nativeElement)
So to remove the listener we added dynamically we must assign listen or listenGlobal to a variable that will hold the function returned, and then we execute it.
As you can see, now it verifies if we're passing a string (document, body or window), in which case it will use an internal addGlobalEventListener function.
In any other case, when we pass an element (nativeElement) it will use a simple addEventListener
If i´m adding a listener
I added a common component commonlib-header which is used like this in an external application.
The dynamic event is added in the onClick(fn: any) method:
I will add a [StackBlitz example (hyper-link)] and a comment to the answer from @tahiche.
The return value is a function to remove the event listener after you have added it.
I added a body with an image as follows: 
<img src="x" onerror="alert(1)"></div> 
to show that the sanitizer is doing its job.
a line beginning with 160000), in which case the repository in projectfolder has already been added as a "gitlink".
If it doesn't appear in the output of git submodule, and you want to re-add it as a submodule, you can do:
... to add the repository as a submodule.
... and then add the submodule with:
Starting with an empty repo, adding the submodule in a new folder called "projectfolder/common_code".
After that it was possible to add the project code in projectfolder.
It is now possible to add more submodules, and the project code can be added to projectfolder.
The error I was getting was a little different: <path> already exists and is not a valid git repo (and added here for SEO value)
The directory will be created as part of the git submodule add command.
git submodule add git://url_to_repo projectfolder/common_code/ (Note the required trailing slash.)
Add submodule
For example: You have a theme folder called AwesomeTheme that's a dedicated repository, you try do dump it directly into your main repository like git submodule add sites/themes and you get this "AwesomeTheme" index already exists.
Now you can run git submodule add git@AwesomeTheme.repowhateverurlthing sites/themes/AwesomeTheme
if there exists a folder named x under git control, you want add a same name submodule , you should delete folder x and commit it first.
Committing is not needed, staging suffices.. git add / git rm -r
and then add submodule
An alternative approach is [resample (hyper-link)], which can handle duplicate dates in addition to missing dates.
I left the missing dates as NaNs to make it clear how this works, but you can add fillna(0) to replace NaNs with zeroes as requested by the OP or alternatively use something like interpolate() to fill with non-zero values based on the neighboring rows.
This should get the id added.
I've added some code to my project, so it's more convenient.
Just remove COLUMN from ADD COLUMN
It could be doing the temp table renaming if you are trying to add a column to the beginning of the table (as this is easier than altering the order).
The correct syntax for adding column into table is:
To add multiple columns use brackets:
This is how Adding new column to Table
To add a row:
You have to add datarows to your datatable for this.
Additionally, you can also export your data:
In addition to the other answers.
If you control the structure of the DataTable there is a shortcut for adding rows:
// Assume you have a data table defined as in your example named dt
dt.Rows.Add("Name", "Marks");
The DataRowCollection.Add() method has an overload that takes a param array of objects.
So while this is a convenient way to add row data, it can be risky to use.
You can write one liner using [DataRow.Add(params object[] values) (hyper-link)] instead of four lines.
You can also use DataTable.Columns.AddRange to add columns with on statement.
Question 2: How to add row(s)?
Answer 2: Add one row:
Add multiple rows: use ForEach loop
You can add Row in a single line
Add column to table:
Add row to DataTable method 1:
Add row to DataTable method 2:
Add row to DataTable method 3 (Add row from another table by same structure):
Add row to DataTable method 4 (Add row from another table):
Add row to DataTable method 5 (Insert row at an index):
There is no need to subclass it if all you need to do is add a button to it.
Try adding the button to the navigationItem of the view controller that is going to be pushed onto this PropertyViewController class you have created.
You don't actually add buttons and such directly to the UINavigationController.
In BaseView u can define generic methods to add right button or to change left button text.
You should add your barButtonItem in - (void)pushViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController animated:(BOOL)animated method.
Navigation bar and also added background image to right button.
It seems that some people (like me) may come here looking for how to add a navigation bar button in the Interface Builder.
Alternatively, you could add a UINavigationBar from the Object Library.
Control drag from the UIBarButtonItem to the View Controller to add an @IBAction.
This issue can occur if we delete the view controller or try to add new view controller inside the interface builder(main.storyboard).
To fix this issue, it requires to add "Navigation Item" inside new view controller.
Also you are able to add multiple buttons using rightBarButtonItems
Note: If you had an Elastic IP address assigned to instance A when you stopped it, you’ll need to reassociate it after starting it up again.
You can just add a new key to the instance by the following command:
Though you can't add a key pair to a running EC2 instance directly, you can create a linux user and create a new key pair for him, then use it like you would with the original user's key pair.
Step 2: create a new user, we will call our new user “john”:
[code snippet]
Set password for “john” by:
[code snippet]
Add “john” to sudoer’s list by:
[code snippet]
.. and add the following to the end of the file:
[code snippet]
Alright!
Add your SSH pub key to ~ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys on this attached drive.
I didn't find an easy way to add a new key pair via the console, but you can do it manually.
Then edit the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys and add the new key on a new line.
You can actually add a key pair through the elastic beanstalk config page.
To add a new ENUM values:
For the way our enums are set up, I've added new values to existing enum types via:
When using Navicat you can go to types (under view -> others -> types) - get the design view of the type - and click the "add label" button.
Can't add a comment to the appropriate place, but ALTER TABLE foo ALTER COLUMN bar TYPE new_enum_type USING bar::text::new_enum_type with a default on the column failed.
The only problem is that no constraint can be added (and thus neither modified) to a domain if it is used by any composite type (the docs merely says this "should eventually be improved").
(A call to ALTER DOMAIN test_domain VALIDATE CONSTRAINT val_check ends up with the same error as adding a new constraint to the domain used by a composite type, unfortunately.)
If you fall into situation when you should add enum values in transaction, f.e.
execute it in flyway migration on ALTER TYPE statement you will be get error ERROR: ALTER TYPE ... ADD cannot run inside a transaction block (see [flyway issue #350 (hyper-link)]) you could add such values into pg_enum directly as workaround (type_egais_units is name of target enum):
If you are using Postgres 12 (or later) you can just run ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE inside of transaction ([documentation (hyper-link)]).
If ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE (the form that adds a new value to an enum
type) is executed inside a transaction block, the new value cannot be

If your using a UILabel you have to remember that the default setting is 1 line, so it does not matter how many breaks you add (\n or \r), you need to make sure it is set to more than one line so it could be allowed to append more lines.
When our custom directive is compiled, it will modify the element by adding directives and removing itself and use $compile service to compile all the directives (including those that were skipped).
Here's a solution that moves the directives that need to be added dynamically, into the view and also adds some optional (basic) conditional-logic.
The directive takes an array of objects, each object contains the name of the directive to be added and the value to pass to it (if any).
I was struggling to think of a use-case for a directive like this until I thought that it might be useful to add some conditional logic that only adds a directive based on some condition (though the answer below is still contrived).
I added an optional if property that should contain a bool value, expression or function (e.g.
defined in your controller) that determines if the directive should be added or not.
I'm also using attrs.$attr.dynamicDirectives to get the exact attribute declaration used to add the directive (e.g.
I wanted to add my solution since the accepted one didn't quite work for me.
I needed to add a directive but also keep mine on the element.
In this example I am adding a simple ng-style directive to the element.
To prevent infinite compile loops and allowing me to keep my directive I added a check to see if what I added was present before recompiling the element.
This wouldn't work if any of the added directive's require any of the original element's directives or if the original element has absolute positioning.
Then add them using a video filter:
In both cases you must specify video and audio codec, or just copy stream if you just want to add subtitle.
So it will even add the images the matroska may include as attachments (though not another types AFAIK) and convert them to tracks; you will not be able to watch but they will be there (you can demux them).
As you can see, it's all about the -map 0, that tells FFmpeg to add all the tracks, which includes metadata, chapters, attachments, etc.

As other users are pointing out, this is not enough to add the scrollbars.
If an issue is taken about cells not filling the entire table, append the following additional CSS code:
I figured out this answer based on [previous solution and it's comment (hyper-link)] and added some adjustments of my own.
I was able to fix this by adding some styles to the tbody.
So when I wanted to anchor a button at the bottom of the UI, I worked around this by putting the button at the bottom of the CoordinatorLayout (android:layout_gravity="bottom") and adding a bottom margin equal to the button's height to the view beneath the toolbar.
I managed to fix this by adding:
In Firefox you can just add background image to option:
I am going to add an alternative that only uses HTML and CSS without any JS.
My solution is to use FontAwesome and then add library images as text!
Use List<T>.Insert(0, item) or a LinkedList<T>.AddFirst().
Of course, Insert or AddFirst will do the trick, but you could always do:
Add a "Module Library".
There you can select a Jar Directory to add.
Add the directory(ies) you want (note you can multi-select) and click OK
Then you just add this folder to your classpath and %IDEA%\lib\idea_rt.jar.
In the tree structure, find the directory you want to add.
Then either add as a source or test source.
You would have to add the column as allowing NULL, then fill the column with the values you want, and then set it to NOT NULL afterwards.
You either need to define a default, or do what Sean says and add it without the null constraint until you've filled it in on the existing rows.
In this provided function you can add the Active property to the element.
Then it will add a new property named 'Active' and a sample value for this property ('Active) to every single object inside of this object.
Just to clarify: use setText("\u2022 Bullet"); to add the bullet programmatically.
Another best way to add bullet in any text view is stated below two steps:
Then add this drawable in textview and set its pedding by using below properties
Try using list.AddRange(VTSWeb.GetDailyWorktimeViolations(VehicleID2));
Use the AddRange method.
Use .AddRange to append any Enumrable collection to the list.
Use [List.AddRange(collection As IEnumerable(Of T)) (hyper-link)] method.
If you care about it and absolutely only want to get this one single thing working, go with a combination of addEventListener and attachEvent.
If you want to be able to extensively create objects and add and remove event listeners throughout your code, and want that to work across browsers, you definitely want to delegate that responsibility to a library such as jQuery.
Finally, you can try either addEventListener or jQuery, jQuery has the advantage of a nicer interface.
$(element).on('click', function () { add_img(); });
For vc, add following code in assert.h,
Last Ditch Effort: Add a reference to System.Runtime (right click project -> add -> reference -> tick the box next to System.Runtime), although I think I've always figured out one of the above has solved it instead of doing this.
Try add netstandard reference in web.config like this:"
Manually editing the .csproj file and adding the reference below worked for me.
You must add a reference to assembly 'netstandard, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51'."
and ultimately the solution was to add the "netstandard" assembly reference mentioned above:
Manually editing the .csproj file and adding the reference.

I was facing this problem when trying to add a .NETStandard dependency to a .NET4.6.1 library, and compiling it in Linux with Mono 4.6.2 (the version that comes with Ubuntu 16.04).
You can add  to your web.config in your project.
It wouldn't work when you add it to projects web.config because it works with MVC.
It may cause due to adding/removing the .netframework in improper way or it may broke unexpected way.
The solution of Quango in  is working but I prefer to resolve it by adding this code in my Web.config like new projects :
This is where netstandard.dll exists:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Reference Assemblies\Microsoft\Framework\.NETFramework\v4.7.2\Facades\netstandard.dll
Add ref to your Project through this.
You must add a reference to assembly 'system.Runtime, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a
Open .csproj file and under <ItemGroup> tag add a new <Reference> tag as below
No, you have to add them one at a time.
There's no loop in the ADD branch so no repetition is allowed.

As for how those methods work you will need to manually add some macros to decorate your types, which behind the scenes create metadata in the type to provide answers to GetMethods etc.
It required adding some boilerplate code to the classes that would be output:
The first call adds this object to the filtering system, which calls the BuildMap() method to figure out what methods are available.
A Meta Compiler like the Qt Meta Object Compiler which translates your code adding additional meta informations.
A Framework constisting of macros that allow you to add the required meta-informations.
Downsides to the system that might discourage you from bothering:  adding all of the messages and key-values is extremely tedious; it's slower than without any reflection; you'll grow to hate seeing boost::static_pointer_cast and boost::dynamic_pointer_cast all over your codebase with a violent passion; the limitations of the strongly-typed system are still there, you're really just hiding them a bit so it isn't as obvious.
[CAMP (hyper-link)] is an MIT licensed library (formerly LGPL) that adds reflection to the C++ language.
Interesting reflection library that uses clang tooling library to extract information for simple reflection with no need to add macro's: [https://github.com/chakaz/reflang (hyper-link)]
Some additional clang tooling approaches:
It uses a meta-compiler like Qt's and adds meta information directly into object files.
This macro should have zero-overhead to struct creation/destruction in run-time, and the code of T.EnumerateWith() should be generated on-demand, which can be achieved by making it template-inline function, so the only overhead in all the story is to add ENUMERATE_MEMBERS(m1,m2,m3...) to each struct, while implementing specific method per member type is a must in any solution, so I do not assume it as overhead.
That's all there is, no additional code is needed to setup reflection.
Optionally you can supply superclasses (in the parenthesis of the first argument) and field annotations (in the parenthesis preceeding the field you want to annotate) to be able to traverse superclasses or add additional compile-time information to a field (such as Json::Ignore).

Add this code in your .csproj file:
This problem is not related to Visual Studio itself, so answers suggesting adding build steps to copy files over are rather a workaround.
Same with adding compiler binaries manually to the project.

If you were adding ASPNETCOMPILER to compile your Razor views in MVC, like in [this StackOverflow question (hyper-link)], then change PhysicalPath to place where Roslyn nuget package is located (usually pointed via $CscToolPath variable):
Add PropertyGroup to your .csproj file
At project creation the $(WebProjectOutputDir)\bin doesn't exist, therefore when Rosalyn is added as a dependency by NuGet it installs it properly.
Your build is trying to find \bin\roslyn\csc.exe because the following packages have been added to your project.
What is Roslyn and Who added them(packages) in the project : If you’re using .net Framework 4.5.2 to create projects
using VS2015, you might have noticed that the project templates use
Roslyn by default.
After much frustration I decided on a 'hack' fix - an additional post-build task to delete these files from the bin directory, removing the conflict.
select add > files and add all files from packages\Microsoft.Net.Compilers.1.3.2\tools
I compared the new project with the last working project, and found the following lines were missing and needed to be added back in:
This result in, when I installed the component on the main program, the Microsoft.Net.Compilers get added it selves automatically.
Remember this package compile your folder and if its not there you cannot compile anything and so you cannot add anything too.
I originally tried to added target node to the .proj file as mentioned in some of the other answers, but that just lead to another error where the msbuild could not copy the pagefile.sys which seemed from what I read to be a bug in the nuget package.

Create a formset which corresponds to the situation before clicking the "add" button.
Modify the formset to correspond to the situation after clicking the "add" button (change the number of extra fields).
Attach that JavaScript to the "add" button.
After it is finished, it updates the TOTAL_FORMS field to reflect the new form and adds it to the end of the set.
1) User adds two new forms to the formset using the "add-more" button
4) Formset is now reduced to the original form, all dynamically added forms are not there
You must keep that information accurate in order for Django to be aware of the forms you add.

Ok, Here I have seen a lot of answers already given,
I want to add some more that are fixed unresolved function/method/variable warning.
Note that the additional packages that you want to use are included.
Use add to append single values
Use update to add elements from tuples, sets, lists or frozen-sets
If you want to add a tuple or frozen-set itself, use add
Note: Since set elements must be hashable, and lists are considered mutable, you cannot add a list to a set.
You also cannot add other sets to a set.
You can however, add the elements from lists and sets as demonstrated with the ".update" method.
This question is the first one that shows up on Google when one looks up "Python how to add elements to set", so it's worth noting explicitly that, if you want to add a whole string to a set, it should be added with .add(), not .update().
If you do bar_set.add(foo_str), the contents of your set will be {'this is a sentence'}.
The way I like to do this is to convert both the original set and the values I'd like to add into lists, add them, and then convert them back into a set, like this:
This way I can also easily add multiple sets using the same logic, which gets me an TypeError: unhashable type: 'set' if I try doing it with the .update() method.
No - you have to do it the other way around: add it right from the get go as INT IDENTITY - it will be filled with identity values when you do this:
If you don't care about the number order, you'd add the column, NOT NULL, with IDENTITY in one go.
If you need to preserve some number order, then add the numbers accordingly.
This allows you to generate a script which will do the column drop/add/keep numbers/reseed for you.
When we add and identity column in an existing table it will automatically populate no need to populate it manually.
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT;
This answer is a small addition to the highest voted answer and works for SQL Server.
The question requested an auto increment primary key, the current answer does add the primary key, but it is not flagged as auto-increment.
The script below checks for the columns, existence, and adds it with the autoincrement flag enabled.
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD COLUMN ID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT ;
This could be useful
alter table   /** paste the tabal's name **/
add id int IDENTITY(1,1)
So, given this, what type of object could you add to List foo3 that would be legal after any of the above possible ArrayList assignments:
You can't add an Integer because foo3 could be pointing at a List<Double>.
You can't add a Double because foo3 could be pointing at a List<Integer>.
You can't add a Number because foo3 could be pointing at a List<Integer>.
You can't add any object to List<?
The only "guarantee" you have is you are able to add a value of type T (or any subclass of T) without violating the integrity of the list being pointed to.
Notice how the src list declaration uses extends to allow me to pass any List from a family of related List types and still guarantee it will produce values of type T or subclasses of T. But you cannot add to the src list.
extends Number > list ) that which of them it is, so when u wanna use add method its not known if the input is of the same type or not; what is the type at all?
Because untypedList, superclassedList and trulyclassedList are just references to list, you will still be adding elements to the original ArrayList.
Because 3 is primitive (int), which does not extend Number, you can add its boxed type (Integer.valueOf(3)).

It works no matter if you've created a .gitignore or not, no matter if you've added node_modules to git tracking or not.
git rm -r --cached removes the node_modules folder from git control if it was added before.

and next add this in your .gitignore file
You can also add others files too to ignore them to be pushed on github.
You can add them according to your requirement.

Note: You can easily change or add more websites on Google Analytics page from your Google Analytics admin panel.
Update 2: - Adding Google Analytics Tracking ID to Already created Github pages (As requested by [@avi-aryan (hyper-link)] )
You can add Google Analytics to a Jekyll site the same way you would any other site.
For anyone interested, if you are using Jekyll with GitHub pages, I just wrote a post showing how to correctly [add Google Analytics Tracking ID to Jekyll (hyper-link)].
Add Google Analytics Tracking ID code to analytics.html.
Finally, open _layouts/head.html, and add {% include analytics.html %} just before the end </head> tag.
Add google_analytics: UA-xxxxxxxx-x to your _config.yml
Create a file _includes/google-analytics.html and add the google analytics js code in it.
Then add a new file to your repository root named Gemfile with this content:
From the installation instruction, I didn't have to add the {% seo %} in the html, luckily, because I have no html.
To add Google Analytics, I just followed the advice in the 'cayman' repository ([https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman (hyper-link)]):
With me, I was unable to configure Google Analytics 4 (prev Web+App) via adding google_analytics: UA-xxxxxxxx-x to your _config.yml as mentioned previously in one of the answers.
Add html file to the header
in the Rmarkdown YAML, add the reference to your specific script ([see ref here (hyper-link)]):
Adding analytics via _config.yml.
Add this tracking ID to your gh-pages sites's _config.yml.
The above steps show how to add google analytics to an existing gh-pages site.
<input type='button' value='XYZ' id='btnAddProfile'>
<button id='btnAddProfile'>XYZ</button>
$("#btnAddProfile").html('Save');
$("#btnAddProfile").text("Save");
You can also add extra properties like this:
the below function will check the column if exist return appropriate message else it will add the column to the table.
You can't pass these as parameters, you'll need to do variable substitution in the string on the client side, but this is a self contained query that only emits a message if the column already exists, adds if it doesn't and will continue to fail on other errors (like an invalid data type).
Can be added to migration scripts invoke function and drop when done.
And then add the column to particular table.
This will add all paths and ignore matches from .gitignore
I think you mean git add .
which will add all of the files to the repo that AREN'T specified in the .gitignore - you can see these changes by typing git status
in bash usually means this directory and all other directories recursively, so if you do this from the bottom level of your repo, you should add all of the files.
My usual git flow is to create the .gitignore file and add the project files to the repo.
I'll test the .gitignore file by typing git status after importing the files - if I see the files that I've added (for example only .php or .html, NOT .mp3 or .mov), then you can git add .
to add all, and git commit -m "initial commit" to commit them and you should be set.
Try git add .
(which means "add all files in the current directory and below")
Any rule you add here will not be checked in, and will only ignore files for your local repository.
Add rules to the exclude file as you would the .gitignore file
Mine still include files i told it to ignore, so i did this...
i added to gitignore -> " .gitignore "
then i tried " git status ", and the file i wanted ignored were ignored.
Ensure that these directories are not already added to git, as that will override the ignores.
All the above answers are valid, but something that I don't think is mentioned is that once you add a file from that directory into the repo, you can't ignore that directory/subdirectory that contains that file (git will ignore that directive).
To ignore already added files run
The generic way to ignore all subfolders, while continuing to track the files that are in the /bin directory would be to add the following line to your project's .gitignore file:
Besides putting the correct entries in your .gitignore file, if you're trying to ignore something already added to the repo, you have to do git rm -r /path/to/dir and commit that before you add the dir to your .gitignore file.
To just exclude all subdirectories but take the content, add "/":
The second issue is that when you're adding a fragment this way, you must pass a reference to the fragment's containing view, and that view must have a custom id.
basically you don't need to add a frameLayout as container of your fragment instead you can add straight the fragment into the android  root View container
To add a fragment into a Activity or FramentActivity it requires a
  Container.
Add frameLayout in your activity
now in activity, add following method
This answer does not address table alteration.
I tried to add the primary key afterwards by changing the sqlite_master table directly.
Use this as a method in your class to check 1st whether the column you want to add is missing .
Adding a legend to just one plot, however, alters the size of one plot relative to the other.
Note that this will require library(grid) in addition to library(gridExtra).
You cannot add a new property() to an instance at runtime, because properties are data descriptors.
You can add a property to a class dynamically.
But that's the catch: you have to add it to the class.
Say you have an object that you want to add a property to.
Now I will typically add them to the source code where the object is defined, but let's assume you don't have that access, or you need to truly dynamically choose your functions programmatically.
My solution requires you to add 2 extra lines above your class to create a base class for the class you want to add the properties to, then 1 line per and you have the option to add callbacks to control the data, inform you when data changes, restrict the data which can be set based on value and / or data-type, and much more.
Additionally, the values are the only non-static data which are assigned to the class instance, but the actual property is assigned to the class meaning the things you don't want to repeat, don't need to be repeated... You can assign a default value so the getter doesn't need it each time, although there is an option to override the default default value, and there is another option so the getter returns the raw stored value by overriding default returns ( note: this method means the raw value is only assigned when a value is assigned, otherwise it is None - when the value is Reset, then it assigns None, etc.. )
There are many helper functions too - the first property which gets added adds 2 or so helpers to the class for referencing the instance values...
They are ResetAccessors( _key, .. ) varargs repeated ( all can be repeated using the first named args ) and SetAccessors( _key, _value ) with the option of more being added to the main class to aide in efficiency - the ones planned are: a way to group accessors together, so if you tend to reset a few at a time, every time, you can assign them to a group and reset the group instead of repeating the named keys each time, and more.
I also create a lot of functions, as mentioned, some of which use  accessor function information so it doesn't need to be called ( as it is a bit inconvenient at the moment - right now you need to use _class..FunctionName( _class_instance, args ) - I got around using the stack / trace to grab the instance reference to grab the value by adding the functions which either run this bit marathon, or by adding the accessors to the object and using self ( named this to point out they're for the instance and to retain access to self, the AccessorFunc class reference, and other information from within the function definitions ).
This beauty makes it incredibly easy to create new classes with dynamically added properties with AccessorFuncs / callbacks / data-type / value enforcement, etc.
I am also working on an IDE-like code mapping system for it - take a look at: [https://bitbucket.org/Acecool/acecoolcodemappingsystem/src/master/ (hyper-link)] ( Add Repo in Package Manager first, then Install Plugin - when version 1.0.0 is ready, I'll add it to the main plugin list... )
Adds the properties when the class is defined, instead of every time an object is created.
After the class has been defined, you just do this to add a property to it dynamically:
If I guess correctly, these are paddings for stack alignment.
Is it the padding that is the culprit in this case?
It is very likely that the padding is the culprit.
The reason padding is felt to be necessary and is useful in some cases is that code is typically fetched in lines of 16 bytes (see [Agner Fog's optimization resources (hyper-link)] for the details, which vary by model of processor).
The same rules might come into play when you swap the location of add and work in the generated code or when the position of both slightly changes.
Is it the padding that is the culprit in this case?
an XX byte boundary cuts add() in the middle (XX being machine dependent).
if the call to add() has to jump over an XX byte boundary and the target is not aligned.
if  add() is not aligned.
a 256 byte boundary cuts add() right in the middle and neither add() nor the loop is aligned.
In case gcc-4.7.3 -Os (executes in 0.822 secs), the 256 byte boundary only cuts into a cold section (but neither the loop, nor add() is cut):
Nothing is aligned, and the call to add() has to jump over the 256 byte boundary.
In case gcc-4.6.4 -Os (executes in 0.709 secs), although nothing is aligned, the call to add() doesn't have to jump over the 256 byte boundary and the target is exactly 32 byte away:
How can the inlining of such a tiny function like add() fail?

Best cross browser solution (mostly for IE support) like @Steve said is to make a div 98px in width and height than add a border 1px around it, or you could make a background image for div 100x100 px and draw a border on it.
Yes, box-shadow is used to add box-shadows to the elements.
This way, the border width is not added to the width of an element.
If you use box-sizing: border-box means not only border,
  padding,margin, etc.
You can look at outline with offset but this needs some padding to exists on your div.
It also has no need for additional markup or misappropriating other css properties that may be needed later on.
One solution I didn't see mentioned above is the case where you have padding on your input, which I do 99% of the time.
What I like about this is that I have the full menu of border + padding + transition properties for each side.
The syntax for [IBM DB2 LUW (hyper-link)] is similar, repeating the keyword ADD but (if I read the diagram correctly) not requiring a comma to separate the added items.
[PostgreSQL DLL (hyper-link)] to add an FK column:
ALTER TABLE TableName
 ADD NewColumnName INTEGER,
 FOREIGN KEY(NewColumnName) REFERENCES [ForeignKey_TableName](Foreign_Key_Column)
If you also need to add default values in case you already have some rows in the table then add DEFAULT val
If there is a remote section in your repository's configuration file, and the URL matches, you need only to add push configuration.
You don't have to remove your existing "origin" remote, just use a name other than "origin" for your remote add, e.g.
git remote add github git@github.com:myname/oldrep.git
You might have already added a 'git origin' to your .git configuration.
Now that your old remote repository is disconnected, you can add the new remote repository.
Yes, these are for repository init and adding a new remote.
git remote add origin git@github.com:username/myapp.git
You need to check the origin and add if not exists.
Now add it again
if you've added the remote repo as origin try implementing this command.
Once you removed existing origin you can add new origin by firing below command in you case ..
Once you add your origin in git, then you can push your local commit to remote origin
Use printf command to have 0 padding:
This is a terse description of the new features added to bash-4.0 since
the release of bash-3.2.
z.  Brace expansion now allows zero-padding of expanded numeric values and will add the proper number of zeroes to make sure all values contain the same number of digits.
Now if you want to copy your files to containers in non-development environments, you can use the ADD or COPY instructions in your Dockerfile.
The fundamental difference between these two is that ADD makes whatever you're adding, be it a folder or just a file actually part of your image.
Anyone who uses the image you've built afterwards will have access to whatever you ADD.
This is true even if you afterwards remove it because Docker works in layers and the ADD layer will still exist as part of the image.
To be clear, you only ADD something at build time and cannot ever ADD at run-time.
A few examples of cases where you'd want to use ADD:
You can then do: ADD ./requirements.txt /requirements.txt followed by RUN pip install -r /requirements.txt
You want to use your app code as context in your Dockerfile, for example, if you want to set your app directory as the working dir in your image and to have the default command in a container run from your image actually run your app, you can do:
ADD ./ /usr/local/git/my_app
WORKDIR /usr/local/git/my_app
CMD python ./main.py
You can do this by creating a mount point at /var/log/my_app by adding VOLUME /var/log/my_app to your Dockerfile and then running your container with docker run -v /host/log/dir/my_app:/var/log/my_app some_repo/some_image:some_tag
A good strategy in that case is to add VOLUME /etc/settings/my_app_settings to your Dockerfile, run your container with docker run -v /host/settings/dir:/etc/settings/my_app_settings some_repo/some_image:some_tag, and make sure the /host/settings/dir exists in all environments you expect your app to be run.
You can also add an extension method to the Enum type rather than an instance of the Enum:
All answers are great, but they are talking about adding extension method to a specific type of enum.
What if you want to add a method to all enums like returning an int of current value instead of explicit casting?
