Would you even want to override [Activity|ViewGroup|View].dispatchTouchEvent?  Unless you are doing some custom routing you probably should not.
For example, the simplest case is that of View.dispatchTouchEvent which will route the touch event to either OnTouchListener.onTouch if it's defined or to the extension method onTouchEvent.
