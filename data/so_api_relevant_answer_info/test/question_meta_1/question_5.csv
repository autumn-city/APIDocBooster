,Found out the reason.,Output of BatchNorm1d in PyTorch does not match output of manually normalizing input dimensions,<machine-learning><batch-normalization><pytorctl>,www.stackoverflow.com/questions/48991874,"In an attempt to understand how BatchNorm1d works in PyTorch, I tried to match the output of BatchNorm1d operation on a 2D tensor with manually normalizing it. The manual output seems to be scaled down by a factor of 0.9747. Here's the code (note that affine is set to false):
[code snippet]
Output is:

Doing the same thing for BatchNorm2d works without any issues. How does BatchNorm1d calculate its output?
