hello guys ,now we will come to example about Tracking and counting objects using yolov5 and
deepsort, here I will use open source deepsort with pytorch, Watch my example video
it will count cars on highway through this line ,, as we know about yolov5 is
a fast and accurate algorithm for object detection and deepsort is an algorithm for object tracking
deepsort it has two main points to care about it will use a distance to calculate
the position distance in vector space to link the previous and next frames and the
cosine distance between the feature vectors of the boxes using the deeplearning model
, for algorithms about tracking, it will have 2 main points, it
is about finding the link between the previous boxes and the next box. The second is
the life cycle of the tracks, it consists of 3 main steps: initialization, tracking and delete tracking object.
here I create a new environment for the project
I use venv or  type "ctrl + shift + p" in vscode for exists environment
after creating , activate the environment
clone 2 projects deepsort and yolov5 
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/mikel-brostrom/Yolov5_DeepSort_Pytorch.git
next I will copy the example video file and learn the track.py file. 
first read the input initialization variables,
1, this is yolov5's model, I choose yolov5n as a
small and light model that helps to run fast and still meet the accuracy ,
2 is deepsort's model uses an OSnet X025 reid model,
the third parameter is the input source, my input is video, source = 0 for webcam
imgz is the size of the image
when processing video, it will read out frame by frame , resize it to 640x640
when we reduce this imgz it will help improve the processing speed
but that means the accuracy it will probably be reduced
then next is the confidence threshold of yolov5, of classes and iou box
increased a bit, default device is cpu, device = 0 for gpu
if there are many gpu, you can choose another index
next to watch vi deo
 
pretrain model with coco dataset has 80 classes 
This class parameter filters out classes to detect
& advanced parameters
the main processing function detects
this as input
if using webcam source = 0
deepsort using vector distances, and the extracted cosine vector creates the cost matrix
which helps calculate to link the detection boxes over consecutive frames, the deepsort class will manage them and the lifecycle of the tracked objects
here is the config deepsort
maxage = 30 is the number the number of frames, this is the life time of the tracks when the link is lost, it does not delete immediately, but waits for 30 frames if the box does not appear, then it will delete
it. get these guys to go to the bar
Yes, there will be a waiting time for the next 34 If there are any beliefs it can't believe
n_init =3 is a 3 frame challenge since the new box appears, that box will be tracked if 3 frames appear in a row
n_init =3 is a 3 frame challenge from the appearance of a new box, that box will be monitor if there are 3 consecutive frames
but it still finds a pen to link to increase the strange ID, it will change the id
to confirm the status,
please run the test, first need to install the necessary libs
first need to install the necessary libs
install the necessary libs
ok , need to clone reid to the project
clone reid to the
test run
this is the result
it will download the model
to increase the link , change the MAX_DIST value
ok , better then
help the boxes less flicker,
reduce the situation where the boxes exchange id's with each other
press q to turn off the video
followed by the track
load the model
LoadImage is a thread that reads the frame and the main thread preprocessor
will take the frame from there and the processor
reads each frame
with the original frame and , the preprocessor frame
sets it to values ​​from 0 to 1
performs the detection of boxes in
the resulting frame passing through nms to
give the findings and in deepsort to initialize, track , delete
out of the box , then the deepsort input comes with confs , and
if the class is less than the initial threshold value, it will ignore that box
even though ng to filter
function  update caculate distance and change status tracks
if the boxes are unlinked, it will be initialized
when it is linked to the boxes in the previous track, then the id will be assigned
to see the returned deepsort values ​​(bbox, track id, class)
if there is a return
(bbox, track id, class)
that drawing , then to perform the problem of counting the number of cars, it will need to have a
line as a landmark and determine when the car passes. that landmark, then we will count and increment the counter.
The idea is to use the center point of the box
to draw the center point to visualize, point to the function box_label
p1 is the upper left
point p2 is the lower right of box
drawing the circle box at the center of the box
determines the center based on p1 , p2
determines the center based on p1 , p2
Now I will need to define a line as a marker
when the center passes will count
and draw here
start_point , end_point
needs to determine the size of the frame , w and h
the length and width of the image
define the line at y- 350
which defines the line at y- 350
which defines the line at y- 350
when turned on The green line
defines the event to count
generating the counter variable , and a list store the ids that have been counted so as not to count twice with 1 id
the count function will do the counting
here I will use global for the global variable to
take the center and the line
to take the center and the line
to get the center and the line to
when the center of a box  cross this line,it will have a 
Y point > Y point of green line 
now his height
the y value of the center is greater than the y value of the line
said slightly green line cure other sneezes this is not the height of p - 350
350 our green line
h - 350 then the blue dot line
if y of center is greater than y of landmark
add id to list data after counting to not count again
condition id not in what's up with the data
,
draw the count value on the image
Yes, there seems to be something wrong, yes,
the results are
wrong
with the problem of losing the card on the way out, so what do you think this will be an
exercise ? You rotate by red-shifting the high function, this way it helps you to get to other videos
that can be applied to your other problems. Have you followed?
