The getBaseContext() is the method of ContextWrapper.  And ContextWrapper is, "Proxying implementation of Context that simply delegates all of its calls to another Context. Can be subclassed to modify behavior without changing the original Context." (as per javadocs)
The method getBaseContext() can be used to access the “base” Context that the ContextWrapper wraps around.  You might need to access the “base” context if you need to, for example, check whether it’s a Service, Activity or Application:
The answer by Waqas is very clear and complete, however I'd like to further clarify the difference between using this vs. getBaseContext(), or getApplication() vs. getApplicationContext(). 
"Proxying implementation of Context that simply delegates all of its calls to another Context". 
The same logic applies to getApplication() vs. getApplicationContext().
