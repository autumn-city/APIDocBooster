Hey everybody and welcome back to another python scripting tutorial
though this time, It's the first in blender 2.9
So as I mentioned in the last video, I want to take a look at an error message and how we can fix it
So let's go ahead and jump right in
i'm going to change this to the scripting workspace
Then let's make a little bit of room over here
now, let's get rid of the python console
don't need it
So i've already installed the add-on if I press n
Go down to the shader library
So for those of you who don't know the shader library is just a simple add-on that will add a shader
So if you want to download this it is a free blender add-on
There will be a link in the description to our blog go ahead and check that out
So this all worked fine in previous versions of blender?
But in version 2.9
We can see the stylized section no longer works and if we go down here to the info window if we just scroll the mouse
We can see this error code pops up.
So let's make a bit of space.
Let's read this error message. It's quite a big one
And then if we scroll through all of this don't worry about all of this text right now i'll explain what this means
It's not important
So, let's just scroll all the way up to the top here
So this is what your error message looks like
And by the way, it now has a red x which is a nice little addition to blender 2.9
So we can see right here. It says line 167
So if we had the script open, we'll be able to see where it is. So let's go ahead and do that
So you could just go to open and find the script
But what i'm going to do instead is go to one of these options here
I'm going to open up the search operator for me. It's spacebar, but for you, it could be f3
Then i'm just going to type edit source
And then click this and it'll open up the script for me
So now with this script open, I want to go to line 167
just scroll down
It actually displays the line of text here so we know it's a problem with something in this line of text
Then if we go down it says type error
Error with keyword argument icon so we know it's a problem with somewhere within this icon
So if we keep reading it says force underscore smoke flow not found in any of this list
And this is just a list of all the possible icons that you can use, so don't worry about all these
It's just saying that the force underscore smoke flow is no longer in this list. So that's all it is
It's just changed an icon so we can see over here force underscore smoke flow is no longer being used
so if we change this to say question
Since we know it's here
now if we run script
We can see these options are now being displayed. The only problem was the icon
So yeah, maybe icons have changed you need to go through your options and just make sure there is no errors there
It's definitely worthwhile checking your error code see what the problem is and see where you can fix it
We can see it's just a simple fix by changing the icon name in the future
It might be a little bit more complex
But by reading the error messages we can get a clear understanding of what the problem is
