We use the FragmentManager 
to begin a transaction,
to look that we want 
to add this transaction
to the back stack,
and the use the replace command
specifying the container i.d.
whose contents we want to replace
and the new fragment we want 
to put in there.
And we execute the transaction 
by calling commit.
Now you can actually chain 
a number of changes together
within the same transaction, 
so it's also possible to achieve
much of the same effect 
by first removing the contents
of container A and adding 
fragment B to that container.
