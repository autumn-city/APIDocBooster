There is no standard C++ sgn function.
Is there a standard sign function (signum, sgn) in C/C++?
Is there a standard sign function (signum, sgn) in C/C++?
and I found first function - the one with two arguments, to be much more useful from "standard" sgn(), because it is most often used in code like this:
in fact i have this piece of code using sgn()
Further down in the [same Javadocs for compareTo (hyper-link)], the "sgn" function is described.
In the foregoing description, the notation sgn(expression) designates the mathematical sign function, which is defined to return one of -1, 0, or 1 according to whether the value of expression is negative, zero, or positive, respectively.
There is no sgn method that I can see in Java.
but referring to the [well-known mathematical function ("sgn") (hyper-link)] was sufficient.
Well, then I simply have to define my own sgn(x) function.
int sgn(double d) {
  if (d < -eps) {
    return -1;
  } else {
    return d > eps;
  }
}
sgn function returns -1 is the value is lower than -eps, 0 if value is in [-eps,eps] and 1 if value is greater than eps.
You can inline your sgn.
And again, inlining the sgn,
One approach that can work better is by implementing a custom sgn() function that has epsilon-tolerance around zero, instead of expecting precise equality with zero.
From your compare we have sgn(compare(x, y)) as negative and sgn(compare(y, x)) as zero, invalidating the first condition of the Comparator contract.
In the foregoing description, the notation sgn(expression) designates the mathematical signum function, which is defined to return one of -1, 0, or 1 according to whether the value of expression is negative, zero or positive.
If sgn is 0, ~sgn+1 is also 0, so pow2 ^ (~sgn+1) == pow2.
If sgn is 1, (~sgn+1) is 0xFFFFFFFF, and (pow2 ^ (~sgn+1)) + sgn == -pow2.
You can do something like (from the link)
x += ((pow2 ^ -sgn) + sgn)
Note that there is already an _mm_sign_epi16 intrinsic in SSSE3 (PSIGNW - see tmmintrin.h), which behaves somewhat differently, so I changed the name for the required function to _mm_sgn_epi16.
The rest of the application should be made dependent on the promise returned by SGN.importPermissions(), and so it could be like this:
I've overlooked that the logarithm of the sigmoid function can be rewritten: log(1.0/(1.0+exp(-sgn*dot(l1, l2a.T)))) = log(1)-log(1.0+exp(-sgn*dot(l1, l2a.T))) = -log(1.0+exp(-sgn*dot(l1, l2a.T)))
Moreover, to get a correct determinant, det and sgn must be initialized to 1, as signaled by @KileKanos.
You should not do the compareTo twice; compare once and assign the result to sgn; then break if !=0
Another item to do is to verify that the sgn function has a declaration in this translation unit.
The implementor must ensure that sgn(compare(x, y)) == -sgn(compare(y, x)) for all x and y.
Finally, the implementor must ensure that compare(x, y)==0 implies that sgn(compare(x, z))==sgn(compare(y, z)) for all z.
(where sgn(x) is the 'Math.signum()' function.)
This question features answer that explains those:

Did you also mean to leave the line sgn <= That(3);?
You can't drive sgn from multiple places.
If the input is negative, use the two's complement, else use the original number (and output the appropriate value on sgn).
df.SGN.where(df.SGN == 'VW') marks all non-VW values as NA;

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
arr = np.array([12, 15, 9, 8, -1, 1, -12, -10, 10])
sgn = pd.Series(np.sign(np.trunc(arr/10)))
trailingEdge = sgn[sgn!=0].diff()
edgeIndex = np.array(trailingEdge[trailingEdge!=0].index)
edgeIndex[:-1] + np.diff(edgeIndex) / 2
I had some trouble figuring out why float4byte does sgn * Math.pow(16.0, exp - 6) * mant, when I realized that simply is the same as sgn * Math.pow(16, exp) * (mant / Math.pow(2, 24), which is exactly the way IBM floats work.
your Sgn and sgn declarations) then use the type checker on that file to resolve the types.
double xDotDot = -const_b/mxDot-const_k/mx+p/m*sgn;
And in signed_hash() method i was passing authenticatedattributebytes to
sgn.getEncodedPKCS7.
You seem to be referencing the wrong entity name,      targetEntity="SGN\Models\BetterButtonTransaction" should be 
targetEntity="name_of_the_table_as_is_in_the_database".
An example: VietJet offers SGN-DAD for a base fare of 55EUR ( without taxes& fees ).
Thus, before calling signWS you have to hash that attributes structure returned by sgn.getAuthenticatedAttributeBytes and then wrap the resulting hash value in a DigestInfo object.
This is due to the jumps introduced by the sgn() function.
The following algorithm calculates the jump points of the sgn() function and then evaluates the analytic integrals on all pieces:
In that equation you found online, there's something that looked curious, namely two occurrences of Î¸(sqrt(sgn(sin(t/2)))).
Taking the square root of the sgn function is wrong (the is no real square root of -1).
