Note that onCreate() is only invoked when the database file didn't exist so the DROP TABLE is really not needed. 
 And then that query you have to execute inside the callback method onCreate, which you have to override once you extend a class with the SQLiteOpenHelper class.  So that query you have to execute inside the onCreate.  Either you can execute it directly-- you can put the whole query directly inside a db.exeSQL. 
 And inside the SQLiteOpenHelper class, I will be putting a database-- I will be creating that whole structure.  There will be onCreate, there will be onUpgrade, insert query will be there, and update, delete-- all those queries will be there inside one class.  That will be the subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper class. 
Suppose for the first time deployment , database version was 1 and in second deployment there was change in database structure like adding extra column in table.  Suppose database version is 2 now.
For what it's worth, it's also a bad idea to catch exceptions in onCreate().  If the method returns successfully (doesn't throw), the framework thinks the database was created successfully.
