in this video we will talk about how to add labels 
on bar plot like this and also like this so please  
stay tuned first of all we import matplotlib 
package which is a package for plotting in python  
so we import matplotlib dot pyploy as plt then 
we define two variables day and the temperature  
of each day and the days are the days of the 
week saturday all the way up to friday and the  
temperature is the corresponding temperature of 
each day for example the corresponding temperature  
of saturday is 30 the corresponding temperature 
of sunday is 32 and etc so here we have defined  
two variables day and the temperature and we 
want to plot a bar plot which the x values are  
the days of the week and the height of each bar 
is the temperature in order to plot a bar plot  
we can have two approaches the stateful approach 
and the stateless approach so let's talk about the  
stateful approach and after that we are going to 
talk about the stateless approach as well but now  
let's start with the stateful approach in order to 
plot a bar plot in the stateful approach we simply  
type plt.bar because we want to have a bar plot 
and the x-axis i mean the values on the x-axis  
is the days of the week and the height of each 
bar is the temperature i mean the corresponding  
temperature of each day and also let's pass 
face color and edge color of each bar the  
face color of each bar for example let's consider 
light gray and the edge color for example black  
and if i simply type plt.show in order to show 
the plot you can see that here is our bar plot  
now in order to add value labels in the center 
of each bar in the bar plot we should simply  
store the results of this line in a variable 
let's say for example called bar plot and then  
we simply type plt dot bar label and we should 
pass a couple of arguments the first argument  
is the name of our bar plot so this is the name of 
our bar plot which is bar plot and then the labels  
the labels that we want to show is the temperature 
of each day and the label type is center because  
you want to put the labels on the center in 
the center of each bar so if i run a code
you can see here is the result and the labels is 
in the center of each bar but if you want to put  
the labels on the edge of each bar i mean on the 
top of each bar you can simply replace "center"  
with "edge" and if you run the code you can see 
that here is the results but maybe you want to  
have some distance between the edge of each bar 
i mean top of each bar and the label in order to  
do so you can simply pass another argument which 
is padding and for example you can provide three  
two five or whatever number you want for example 
let's pass three and if i run the code you can see  
now we have a padding of three but as you can see 
this chart doesn't look good because you know the  
y limit of this chart is not proper because of 
these labels and for example if you change the  
limit of the y-axis for example to zero all the 
way up to 36 or let's say 37 then the labels are  
going to be more beautiful so let's change the y 
limit so we simply change the y limit from 0 all  
the way up to 37 and if i run the code now you can 
see the chart is now better and also if you want  
to rotate these x tick labels you can simply type 
plt.xticks so you can simply type plt dot xticks  
and you should pass a rotation for example 
equal to let's say 47 45 and if i run the code  
you can see that we have rotated the 
x tech labels and also you can rotate  
these values as well so for example you 
can pass for example rotation equals to 45  
to this bar label and if you run the code you 
can see also these labels have been rotated  
now let's talk about the stateless approach which 
is very similar to the stateful approach in order  
to do so we simply type plt dot subplots which 
returns two values the first one is our figure  
and the second one is our axes and we want to 
plot a bar plot on our axes so we simply type axes  
dot bar so i should copy this line and i want 
to store the results of this line in a variable  
let's say called bar plot let's say called bar 
plot and then we simply type axes dot bar label  
again i copy this line and plt dot show 
in order to show the chart so i deleted  
these lines and you can see that we have only 
the stateless approach so if i run the code  
you can see here is the results and also you can 
change the y limit so i should simply type ax dot  
set y limit not y limit because in the stateless 
approach we have set y limit and here we should  
pass 0 for example all the way up to 37 and if I 
run the code you can see here is the result and  
in order to rotate the x-tick labels we should 
simply type ax which means our axes and our axes  
has a x-axis so i simply type x-axis because we 
want to change something from the x-axis and i  
want to set tick parameters and the parameter 
that i want to change is the rotation which  
i'm going to pass 45 and if i run the code you 
can see now the x-tick labels have been rotated
