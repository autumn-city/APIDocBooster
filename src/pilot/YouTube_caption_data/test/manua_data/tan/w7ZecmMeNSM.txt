Hello and welcome to the Compute
keynote for re:Invent 2020.
My name is Dave Brown and I'm
the vice president for Amazon EC2.
This is my eighth re:Invent
and it is always an exciting
time for us and our customers.
While things are
a little different this year,
we still have an enormous number
of exciting new announcements.
And I'm still excited
that we could be
with so many of you
here in a whole new way.
Well, we have an action
packed hour ahead of us.
So let's get going.
To say 2020 has been an unprecedented
year is an understatement.
COVID-19 has impacted us all.
The way we learn, the way we work,
the way we entertain,
the way we go about our lives.
Our commute times
and carpooling duties
were replaced with
finding a quiet place
to take video calls
and ensuring our kids
turned in their virtual
homework assignments.
Safer at home and shelter in place,
mandates led governments, schools,
businesses to quickly
implement secure
and reliable work
from home solutions.
This put pressure on IT leaders
to respond quickly
to scale their businesses
and meet demands like moving
from in-person interactions
to transactions online.
All of this also led to an enormous
demand in cloud services,
providing organizations
with the agility
that they needed
to support new workloads.
AWS has been able to respond quickly
by helping to provide scalable
and reliable infrastructure
capacity and support our customers.
Across many industries,
companies have looked
to the cloud to ramp
to massive scale to take their
business operations online.
Blackboard, a leading EdTech
company servicing students,
businesses and
governments around the world,
were faced with a 3600%
increase in demand overnight.
We were able to help them
scale 50 times in EC2 capacity
to ensure that students
around the world
migrated from in
the classroom to online learning.
Customers supporting remote
work such as LogMeIn had
to suddenly scale to levels that
they had previously never expected
as everyone moved
to work from home.
Epic games, known for the industry
leading games like
Fortnite and Rocket League,
saw a rapid increase in usage
across the gaming platform.
We were able to help them
scale to meet this demand,
along with hosting some of
the world's largest online events,
consisting of millions of players.
Vyaire, a global medical
company that manufactures,
sells and distributes over
20,000 respiratory care products
and solutions found in ambulances,
operating rooms and nursing homes.
This year, demand for their medical
products hit an all time high.
Which saw Vyaire increase
from about 30 units per week
to almost a thousand per day.
Vyaire migrated to AWS
to increase ventilator
production twenty times,
helping first line responders treat
critical conditions due to COVID-19.
It is during these
unprecedented times
that technologies
are tested to see
if they can scale to meet
the demands of increased usage,
higher performance, reduce
costs and changing customer needs.
Within EC2 and the broader AWS,
we moved to work from
home in early March.
Our existing tools and use of
cloud services supported us well
as we transitioned to what has
now become the new normal.
Like many of our customers,
through this,
we had been able to maintain and
accelerate our pace of innovation.
So far in 2020,
we have had over 160 new launches,
including more than 100 new instances
and 130 new feature releases.
Our customer focus,
our pace of innovation,
our proven track record
and our long term focus
is what sets AWS apart.
Andy Jassy has often said
there is no compression algorithm
for experience,
which is especially true
when it comes to learning
to operate at cloud scale
and ensure that we provide the best
technology platform to our customers.
Gartner's latest magic quadrant
is a testament to our leadership.
For the 10th consecutive year,
Gartner has placed
AWS as their cloud leader
in the Cloud Infrastructure platform
and Services Magic Quadrant.
So, how did we build this platform
that scales for unprecedented times?
Our vision is to build
the compute platform
for virtually every
workload and every need.
We built this massive
compute platform for you,
pushing the limits on security,
pace of innovation
and delivering the best
performance at the lowest price,
enabling support
for diverse workloads
and extending the cloud
to where you need it.
So with no further introduction,
let's start with how
we built this platform
to push the limits
on the fundamentals.
AWS Nitro System is the foundation
on which we were able to deliver
industry leading security,
performance and innovation.
Traditionally,
hypervisors have a lot to do,
including protecting the physical
hardware, firmware, BIOS,
virtualizing the CPU,
storage, networking,
all while providing a rich set
of management capabilities.
After spending
the early years of EC2
optimizing traditional
virtualization systems
to the point of
diminishing returns,
we knew we had to do
a dramatic change of architecture
if we were going
to continue to provide
the performance and security
that our customers
were looking for.
This realization forced us to rethink
everything about virtualization
and compute in the cloud
and became the spark for
us to create the Nitro system.
Over a period of five years,
we worked to develop the Nitro system
by breaking apart
virtualization functions,
offloading them to dedicated
hardware and software,
and reducing costs
by delivering practically all
of the resources of a server
to your instances.
While we began rolling out components
of the Nitro system as early as 2012,
it was only in 2017 that we
launched our first instance
that was fully controlled
by the Nitro system.
RC5 instances.
Now with the Nitro system,
we can offer the world's
most secure cloud environment
the best performance
at the lowest price
and not only more innovation,
but also at a faster pace.
The Nitro system is unique to AWS,
and it is the platform for building
our latest generation of instances.
Although it was only
launched three years ago,
the Nitro system today is used
for over 70 per cent of
instances within EC2.
Let's take a closer look at
the security within the Nitro system.
At AWS,
security is our number one priority.
So when it comes to reinventing
virtualization with the Nitro system,
we made security our
number one priority as well.
The Nitro system has been engineered
with a hardware based route of trust
using the Nitro security chip,
allowing us
to cryptographically measure
and validate
the system continuously.
This provides a significantly
higher level of trust
in what is running than can be
achieved with traditional hardware.
Earlier I mentioned most of
the virtualization resources
are offloaded to dedicated
hardware and software.
This not only makes the hypervisor
more lightweight and efficient,
but it also makes it more secure
because the attack services
and vulnerabilities are minimized.
Finally, the Nitro system
offers a lockdown security model
that prohibits all
administration access,
including those of
Amazon employees,
eliminating the possibility of
human error and tampering.
And this is just
the baseline of the security
built into our platform available
to virtually any workload.
Now,
a platform should not only be secure,
but also have security
features that are easy to use.
Our customers are looking
for ways to more easily process
the highly sensitive data,
so we thought we could help.
Recently you may
have heard of terms like
confidential computing or trusted
computing or isolated computing.
Regardless of
the terminology used,
it is about making processing of
highly sensitive data more secure.
Today, customers use Amazon EC2
to process a range of
highly sensitive data,
such as personally
identifiable information,
health care records, financial data,
intellectual property and more.
They protect this data with
access controls and encryption
when it is in rest and in transit.
But what happens when this data
needs to be decrypted for processing?
Customers set up separate VPCs,
remove unnecessary third
party software on the instances,
limit connectivity,
restrict user access
and more just to isolate
the processing of the sensitive data.
Well, we wanted to make
it a whole lot easier.
So last month we
announced Nitro Enclaves
that simplifies this,
enabling you to easily create
fully isolated compute
environments called enclaves,
to isolate processing of
your highly sensitive data.
To better understand what
Nitro Enclaves are all about,
I caught up with Colm MacCÃ¡rthaigh,
Senior Principal of EC2
to talk more about
our Nitro Enclaves.
Let's take a look.
Well, welcome Colm and thank
you for joining us here today.
We launched Nitro Enclaves
just a few weeks ago now.
And can you maybe start off by
telling us what is the difference
between a Nitro enclave
and a normal EC2 instance?
Yeah,
so Nitro Enclaves help customers
protect their sensitive data
while it's being processed
and they're actually created
from the existing resources
on an EC2 instance.
We take those resources
and we create a highly
isolated virtual machine
that's got no durable storage,
no access to external networking,
and it's got a very,
very small surface area
that's exposed
to any kind of attack.
And in fact,
even the root user or admin users
in the EC2 instance can't
see inside that enclave,
can't read its memory, don't have
any visibility of what's going on.
The only communication
between that instance
and the enclave is a secure
local channel called a vsock.
OK, well, so we've actually
brought a lot of the security
that we built into
the Nitro system
and brought that up
into the application level
to allow our customers to use it.
And so, aside from the isolation,
what are some of the other
benefits of Nitro Enclaves
that you'd like to highlight?
Isolation is definitely the biggest
benefit of Nitro Enclaves.
But enclaves have also been
designed to be very flexible
and easy to use because they're
provided as a virtual machine.
They're compatible with any
programming language or framework
and very easy to use with
almost any programming model.
And second,
Nitro Enclaves use robust,
simple,
CPU based isolation technology
for protecting the instances
from one another.
But that's also combined
with the unique design
of the Nitro system
to provide a route of trust
that's rooted in
AWS design silicon.
And in fact, based on that, we're
including cryptographic attestation
where the Nitro system can
verify the identity of reapplication
and then use that verified
identity for first class integration
with our key management and
certificate management services.
Well, it's fantastic.
So we actually only
launched Nitro Enclaves
just a few weeks ago,
but I'm interested to hear
what is the customer
response been like so far?
So the customer
response has been great.
We've had customers thrilled
with the format and interface
that Nitro Enclaves provides.
We've had customers such
as Adzuna and Cast Labs
and Evervolt building applications
on top of Enclaves already.
So far, the feedback has been
that the Enclaves model
is simple and easy to use
and the folks can get
running quite quickly.
For those customers,
securing data is a big part
of what they've been
doing for a long time.
And so to have a managed,
secure environment available
that can keep that sensitive
data processing isolated
is an enormous simplifier.
Well, and so the simplification
we brought to Nitro Enclaves
has really open this up
to a much broader customer base
to be able to use this,
whereas previous solutions would have
been much more complicated to adopt.
Can you tell me more about
how customers can get started
with Nitro Enclaves?
Yeah.
So Nitro Enclaves is free to use.
There's no cost or
charge to customers
beyond what you are already
paying for your EC2 instance
and it's now generally available.
So our documentation and
material is all there on our website.
Just search for Nitro Enclaves.
And we've also got a number
of reference and open source
Nitro Enclave applications
available in our GitHub repository,
including our own ACM for
Nitro Enclaves application.
So it's pretty easy to take
those and get going.
Fantastic.
So it's a really simple to get going.
Well Colm, I know we're both
very excited about Nitro Enclaves
and see what customers
are going to do with it.
And just thanks again for
coming in and talking today.
Thank you.
As you can see,
we're super excited
about Nitro Enclaves,
especially the ease of
use and the level of security
that it brings to your
application environment.
Another important
benefit of the Nitro system
is enabling better
performance for your workloads.
Before we dive deep into how
we are able to offer better price,
performance and choice,
let's consider what better price
performance actually means.
For a lot of workloads,
customers are looking
for better raw performance.
At the same time, they're looking for
the lowest cost instances or compute.
Price performance is all about giving
you the best possible performance
for every dollar you spend.
Nitro based instances are able
to offer better price performance
across CPU, networking and storage,
because we offload management
processes to lower
cost dedicated hardware.
Not having to hold back
resources for management software
means more savings that can be passed
on to customers in price performance.
It's only the Nitro
System that allows us
to have the broadest selection
of processes in the cloud.
With the very latest
calls from Intel,
AMD and our own ARM based processor,
Graviton2.
Intel have been with us from
the very beginning of EC2.
And today the majority
of our instances
continue to be powered by
the very latest Intel processors.
These are not simply
off the shelf Intel,
Skylake and Cascade
like processors,
but we have partnered with
Intel to bring new processors
that provide the highest
sustained all core turbo frequency,
allowing customer
workloads to run faster.
We're excited to announce a number
of notable new instances with Intel
at re:Invent this year.
A new high frequency instance,
our M5ZN and EBS
optimized instance R5B
offering 60 gigabytes of
bandwidth and 260k IOPS
of EBS storage and a dense
storage instance D3 and D3EN
that offer up to 336 terabytes
of local hard disk drive storage.
We launched our
first AMD instances
in 2018,
powered by the AMD Epic processors
and delivering 10 percent
improved price performance
for x86 workloads.
Customers have loved
the simplicity of migration
and the opportunity to save
10 percent price performance
with very little
effort on their part.
And now let's take
a look at a processor
that is only available
to AWS customers
and provides price
performance benefits
that are seldom
seen in the industry.
Graviton2, our ARM based
services designed and built by AWS,
delivers 40 percent
better price performance
than the current generation of
comparable x86 based instances.
That's 40 percent
better performance
and 20 percent lower cost.
Last re:Invent, we announced
three new instances on Graviton2.
M6g, R6g and C6g,
which are now generally available
along with additional
disk based variants.
A few months ago we launched T4g,
offering the lowest and
best price performance
for burstable workloads.
And new, just at re:Invent,
we launched this C6gn for
compute intensive workloads
such as high
performance computing.
C6gn instances deliver up to 40
percent better price performance
compared to C5n instances,
along with 100 gigabit networking
and support for
elastic fabric adapter.
And our targeted applications
such as data analytics,
network appliances,
real time video communication
and high performance computing.
From the start, we knew that
growing a strong ecosystem
to support ARM based workloads
was going to be critically important.
We worked closely
with operating system
and independent software
ecosystem partners
to drive support for
the 64 bit ARM architecture.
Support for ARM in the open
source software community
was already pervasive,
but AWS is building ARM based
processes at scale
has helped galvanize
the rest of the ecosystem,
prioritizing ARM support.
We have also brought
ARM support to container
based workloads with
support for both ECS and EKS
and have a growing
number of AWS services
that are integrated
with Graviton2.
In my conversations
with customers,
many are concerned about
the complexity of
moving to Graviton2.
But in almost all cases,
the migration is much
simpler than they expected,
and they're reaping
the 40 percent price
performance benefits
before they know it.
Here are a few of
the thousands of customers that
have adopted Graviton2 instances
for their production workloads.
Customers like Nielsen,
Ancestry.com,
CBS, DataDog and LG
Electronics have migrated
and have seen
the benefits of Graviton2
and what it has to offer.
Earlier this week,
I spent some time with Don MacAskill,
the CEO and Chief Geek
of SmugMug and Flickr.
SmugMug is an early adopter
of Graviton based instances
and has been with us on the Graviton
journey from the very beginning.
Let's see what Don had to say.
Well, welcome, Don, and thanks
very much for joining me today.
You know, we've had a long and
fantastic history with SmugMug.
I think you were one of
our very first S3 customers.
I've been working with
you on EC2 over the years
and we're here today to talk
a little bit about Graviton
and what you've been doing
with Graviton at SmugMug.
And so maybe we can start off
about what made you
interested in Graviton to start with.
Yeah. Well,
thank you so much for having me.
It has been a fun journey
getting here to ARM on AWS.
I think we got interested
in ARM about a decade ago
because we knew that for
so many of our workloads,
the price performance would
be way better on ARM than it was
on traditional server,
data center processors.
That's primarily because
many of our workloads
are just not very CPU intensive.
They're often iO bound,
so they're busy shuffling bytes
in and out of network
interfaces or storage or memory
or things like that.
And so for a long time,
it's felt like we were wasting
cost and power on CPUs,
that we're essentially
partially idle.
And so when we found out
that Graviton was coming,
we got really, really excited.
We've been interested
in this for a long time.
And as soon as it came along,
we discovered that absolutely it
was an amazing fit for many
of our CPU light workloads
that needed move
a lot of data around.
And then things really took
a turn for the better when Graviton2
came out, because all of a sudden
even our CPU intensive workloads
were operating
faster on Graviton2,
than they were on
traditional processors.
It was pretty amazing.
That's fantastic.
And Don, you know, with Graviton1,
one of the things we were
really focusing on was,
was triggering that ecosystem,
making sure that the ecosystem
was there to be able to support
workloads running on Graviton.
And so from
an ecosystem point of view,
can you go into more details on how
easy was it to actually use Graviton?
Yeah, so we were really
excited about this project,
but we thought it would
be kind of pretty hard.
We were switching
CPU architectures
and instead we had our first large
scale workload up in about two weeks
because the Linux ecosystem
was already well prepared
for the advent of ARM.
Linux has been on small and embedded
devices running ARM for a long time,
and so most of our two weeks
wasn't spent doing heavy lifting
so much as it was spent just testing
every layer of the architecture
to make sure that all of the packages
we found already precompiled
for ARM actually worked well.
And, you know,
we're bug free and stable and fast.
And so we found out
that was indeed the case.
So two weeks later,
we went into production
and we haven't looked back since.
That's amazing, Don.
And I actually remember when
the launch of Graviton2 happened,
I think it was the very next day
that you actually tweeted and said,
hey, we've just migrated to Graviton2
that literally was one day.
Yeah, it was literally one
day that was that was really fun
and, you know,
the team was really excited about it
and kind of charged off to do it
without even knowing
that was happening.
And so it was great to just
kind of find out later in the day
that, oh, Graviton2 launched
and oh, we already have
a large scale work load up on it.
And, you know, even in
just the last couple of weeks,
we've moved, I think,
three or four major big workloads.
The vast majority of compute
at Flickr is now on Graviton2.
We have a couple of services
that we're still in
the process of moving,
but that's going really,
really well.
The teams are just knocking
them down left and right.
Yeah, it's awesome to see.
Just amazing. And obviously all
of that comes with a 40 percent
improvement on price
performance across the fleet.
You know, Don,
as we think about other customers,
I talk to a lot of customers
and I think about, you know,
moving to Graviton might
require a lot of work on my side.
We have to recompile.
With the experience you've had,
What is your advice
to other customers
looking to maybe embark
on the same journey?
Yeah, I mean,
like being able to save 40 percent
without basically doing anything
other than a recompile or,
you know, a new docker build
or something is pretty incredible.
No contract negotiations.
No fiddling. It's pretty simple.
So if you have workloads like ours,
Linux based workloads,
especially on sort of rich modern
languages like PHP, Python,
Java, that sort of stuff,
like, it's so simple.
I've never, ever in my career
seen saving 40 percent be this easy.
Well done. That's amazing.
Just as incredibly
exciting to hear
what you've been able
to do with SmugMug
and now Flickr as
well with Graviton2.
And I really want to thank
you again for joining us today
and sharing the story. Thank you.
My pleasure.
Thanks so much for having me.
It's always great
catching up with Don
and seeing the excitement that
he has for ARM and Graviton2,
and just what it has done
to improve the price performance,
at SmugMug and Flicker.
Now let's take a look at
some of our accelerators.
Like processors,
we have the broadest selection
of accelerators in the cloud.
We have a very latest Nvidia GPUs,
Xilinx FPGAs for custom
hardware acceleration
and another AWS custom chip,
Inferentia,
targeted at inference workloads.
Today, many of these accelerators
are used for machine learning,
another workload that
has seen a sharp increase
during these unprecedented times.
Today, AWS provides a broad
set of instance options
for machine learning.
For training the process
of teaching your model
how to perform tasks
such as image recognition,
we have our R5 memory
optimized instances for CPU training
and our P3 instance
offering up to 8 Nvidia
v100 Tensor core GPUs
and up to 100 gigabits of
networking throughput for the largest
and most demanding
ML applications.
Last month we announced
the P4d instance,
powered by the latest Nvidia,
A100 GPUs,
they provide up to 2.5 times
better deep learning performance
and 25 per cent more GPU memory.
P4d instances are
deployable is ultra clusters,
which are thousands of
cores deployed together
to more easily allow a user
to help tap into the benefits of
a supercomputer at cloud scale,
along with 400 gigabits of network
throughput between nodes.
P4d is a powerful offering,
providing the highest performance
for ML training in the cloud.
Now let's take a closer look at
what we have been doing to reduce
the cost of inference.
For inference,
the process of deploying the model
and leveraging the trained
model to assess real world data,
we have C5 compute optimized
instances for CPU based inference
and our G4 instance,
offering the latest generation.
Nvidia T4 GPUs, up to 100
gigabits of network in throughput
and 1.8 terabytes of
local nVME storage.
Last year at re:Invent,
we announced AWS
Inferentia and our INF1 instance.
AWS Inferentia is
our first custom silicon
designed to accelerate
deep learning models.
Inferentia's designed to provide high
performance inference in the cloud,
to drive down the total
cost of inference
and make it easy for
developers to integrate machine
learning into their
business applications.
Our INF1 instance provides
up to three times higher
throughput compared
to our G4 instances,
while lowering the cost per
inference by up to 40 percent.
That's an incredible saving.
These instances also provide
support for popular frameworks
including TensorFlow,
PyTorch and MXNet.
CondÃ© Nast, a global media
company with over 20 leading brands
including Wired,
Vogue and Vanity Fair,
integrated Inferentia chips into
their recommendation engine
by using INF1 instances
with SageMaker.
They were able to reduce their
compute costs by 72 per cent
relative to the previously
deployed GPU instances.
Another incredible saving
and one of our most well known
customers, Alexa,
announced they were moving
the processing of their voice
responses to INF1
last year at re:Invent,
and they've already
migrated 80 percent
of their voice traffic to INF1,
reducing the cost of
inference by 30 percent
and improving latency
by a full 25 percent.
If you ask Alexa a question,
there's a good chance
that she'll be speaking back
to you with the help of Inferentia.
It's been amazing to see the success
that these customers have had
with Inferentia improving
performance and reducing costs.
However, we started with
the inference since it makes up
90 percent of the cost of machine
learning and deep learning.
So reducing costs,
there made a huge impact.
But we need to focus on reducing
the costs of training as well.
So today we're happy to announce
Habana based EC2 instances.
Habana Gaudi
accelerators from Intel
will offer up to 40 percent
better price performance
of a current GPU based instances
for training deep learning models.
They will also support
common ML frameworks
like TensorFlow and PyTorch
and allow customers to iterate
and train models more frequently.
Habana based
instances will be available
in the first half of next year
and like computer inference,
we're continuing
to invest in our silicon
to drive down
the cost of ML training.
So earlier today we
introduced AWS Trainium,
a machine learning chip custom
designed by AWS for the most
cost effective training in the cloud.
Trainium based instances
will offer more TFLOPS
compute power than any other machine,
any instance in the cloud.
Again, Trainium will
support all major frameworks,
including Tensor Flow,
MXNet and PyTorch.
Trainium based instances will
also use the same Neuron SDK as
Inferentia instances for ML
inference, making it easy for
developers using Inferentia
to get started on Trainium quickly.
So that rounds out our
offerings in the ML space,
providing the largest selection
of ML instances in the cloud.
We're really excited about what
we have been able to deliver.
For more details,
make sure you catch
Swami's Machine Learning
Keynote next Tuesday.
Finally, Nitro enables us
to innovate an instance design
at an ever increasing pace by
providing basic building blocks
that we can assemble
in different ways.
Today, we have close
to 400 instances within EC2
and you can see the pace of
innovation over the last 10 years.
We launched our first Nitro
based instance at the end of 2017
and you can see the increase
in instances delivered since then.
Across these 400 instances,
we have the broadest and
deepest selection of instance types.
We have the broadest
selection of instance categories,
targeting every possible
use case and capabilities
across each of those
for your every need.
Added to that, we support
multiple operating systems,
including Linux, Unix and Windows.
However, there's one
commonly used operating system
that is missing from the list.
Mac OS is used broadly
around the world today,
but has never been
available in the cloud.
I love my Mac, so this is a hugely
important announcement for me.
Today, millions of Apple
developers rely on Mac OS
and its innovative tools, frameworks
and APIs to develop, build,
test and sign apps
for Apple's industry
leading platforms that serve more
than a billion customers globally.
Until now, development of
these apps for the Apple platform
wasn't possible in the AWS cloud,
and many of our customers
need to manage a fleet of
Macs for their build processes.
Over the last year, we have
been working closely with Apple
to bring Mac to the cloud,
and Monday night we announced general
availability of Amazon EC2 Mac
allowing you to run Mac
workloads in the cloud.
Customers can now seamlessly
provision and access Mac OS
compute environments to enjoy fast
Apples and convenient distributor
testing without having to procure,
configure, operate, maintain
and upgrade fleets
of physical computers.
The availability of Mac
instances extends the flexibility,
scalability and cost savings
of AWS to all Apple developers,
offloading the heavy lifting
that comes with managing
infrastructure to AWS
and allow Apple developers to focus
on building great applications.
If you would like to know
how we pulled this off.
I encourage you to catch
Peter's keynote on Thursday
where he will pull
back the sheet metal
on an Amazon EC2 Mac instance
and show you just how the Nitro
System made this possible.
It's pretty amazing.
Oh, and we were already
working on bringing you
the very latest Apple M1 chip,
which will land next year.
Amazon EC2 Mac instances
is just another example of the pace
of innovation with the Nitro System.
Now let's move on
to the next section.
Every day, millions of
customers trust AWS to run
their business critical workloads.
As I said earlier,
COVID impacted all of us and brought
unprecedented demand to the cloud
in a very short space of time.
To support our customers
and their businesses,
we needed to scale
to meet the demand
and ensure that we could support new
workloads from the financial markets
to medical research to scaling
for video conference applications.
For a firsthand account of what
some of our customers experienced
and how we were able to help,
Let's take a look at the next clip.
Since the all the lockdown began
and all the stay at
home orders began,
we saw a tremendous
increase in the number of people
who were using Fortnight
and Rocket League.
We rely heavily on AWS
to help us manage that scale.
We've had to spin up quite
quickly a large GPU cluster in AWS
and then get this up, get it running
and see the value it can deliver
so that we can then feed
that value back and work
on how we can look to extend
those types of compute jobs.
We got that up in record time,
including all of the complexities
around networks and architecture,
et cetera.
Earlier this year,
and in accordance with local laws,
the COVID pandemic grounded
autonomous vehicles for a few months.
And with engineering efforts
continuing uninterrupted,
this drove a step function increase
in demand for our simulation systems.
AWS was able to help us
access greater volumes
of GPU compute responses
to meet the demand from
our simulation systems.
For video in 2020,
especially in March,
we need to scale up for that.
We were leveraging
on the capabilities of EC2,
especially the C5 lineup
because the C5 lineup gives us
a predictable network performance
and predictable compute performance.
The ability to offload work to AWS
not only relieved the pressure
on the current network spread,
but also provided the ability
to scale up on demand.
So they too can take
advantage of the elasticity
which compute
products like EC2 provide.
It's great to see how our
customers were able to meet
the challenge their
businesses face during this time
and how we were able
to assist in this section.
I'd like to focus on three things.
First, how we were able
to deliver capacity to our customer
needs based on years of experience
in running the world's largest cloud.
Second, how we're scaling
to support our customers
with some of their largest
business workloads.
And finally,
opportunities that our customers
have to optimize their workload,
typically for cost savings
during these challenging times.
Let's start with capacity.
As I said earlier,
the pandemic brought many challenges
and solving many of them required
large amounts of compute capacity.
For example,
one of our financial customers,
FINRA, an organization that
governs the brokerage firms
and exchange markets
in the United States,
has seen market volumes
increase by two to three times
since the start of the pandemic.
AWS has been able to meet FINRA's
demand for these volatile workloads,
allowing them
to automatically turn on and off
up to 100,000
nodes in a single day.
This is just one example of
the thousands of customers
that we were able to work with
to ensure that they had cloud
capacity when they needed it.
To find out a little bit more about
what went on behind the scenes,
at EC2 in providing this
capacity for customers.
I caught up with Scott Sikora,
Director of the Capacity and
Forecasting teams within EC2.
Let's take a look.
Welcome, Scott,
and thank you for joining me today.
Can you tell us a little bit
about what you do at AWS?
Sure. My name is Scott Sikora.
I'm director for EC2 Capacity.
My job is to make sure
that when a customer
needs a thousand M5 large
instances in the Sydney region
that all of the hardware is
there and configured correctly
so that they can actually
launch a thousand.
M5 large instances.
To do that, we work very closely
with our AWS Forecasting team
that provides us
a forecast every week
of how many M5 instances
we think we're going
to need in Sydney.
We do that weekly
and then we turn over
that forecast to our
infrastructure partners
who take that forecast to make
sure that we get the supply chain
all configured so that
every week we've got.
M5s landing in the Sydney
region to meet customer demand.
Great in 2020 has been quite
the year with the pandemic,
a massive increase in
demand for cloud capacity.
We heard stories about
several cloud providers
struggling to provide their
customers with capacity.
AWS was able to meet that demand.
So can you take us back
to February and let us know
what you and your team were
going through as we started
to see this massive increase
in demand for cloud resources?
Yeah,
2020 has been quite the year for us.
And many of those models that
we had that we spent all that time
tuning started
to break down a little bit.
What we saw is a lot of our customers
really scale up quite dramatically.
Customers like online learning where
students were working from home.
We saw our video game
customers really scale as people
are playing more and
more video games.
And we saw our video
streaming customers
really scale dramatically
as people spend a lot of time
at home watching video streaming.
So what we were able to do, we've
got a lot of capacity on the ground.
We've got a lot of capacity in
the supply chain at any one time.
And what we're able to do is very
dynamically reconfigure the supply
that's on the ground, reconfigure
what's happening in the supply chain
to be able to redirect
from one region
or to another to make sure that
we were able to quickly adjust
to where we were seeing the daily
and weekly spikes in demand
where the capacity
was actually needed
and we were able to reconfigure
and redirect supply to those places.
Excellent, Scott, you know,
one of the things we often say
and I mentioned
earlier in the talk
is there's no compression
algorithm for experience.
And these models that you talk about
is something that we've delivered
and developed over many,
many years at AWS
and then our scale helps
us to meet this demand.
And so come back on
the onset of the pandemic.
What did you and your team do?
What did you do anything
specific to make sure that customers
have business continuity during
these unprecedented times?
Yeah, we immediately started
making changes to our demand
planning to be able to buffer
for additional capacity.
We knew that customers were
going to need more capacity,
so we immediately started
changing our models.
We also work closely with
our infrastructure partners,
where some countries
may be harder hit by COVID.
We are able to redirect our
orders for hardware and racks
from some countries
that were having struggles
with COVID to other countries
that were not having as
much problems to be able to,
inside the supply chain, redirect
where that capacity was coming from.
So our infrastructure
partners did a fantastic job
working with those
manufacturers to make sure
that we saw very little
impact from COVID.
But it wasn't for
lack of hard work.
Those guys were working
really hard to make sure
that the capacity ended
up where it needed to be.
It's amazing what the teams
are able to achieve now.
Now Scott, are there any specific
customer examples that you can call
that we were able to help
customers with capacity needs.
Yeah,
let me talk about online learning.
So we have a customer, Blackboard.
Blackboard provides
a video learning capability
for their customers, for schools.
And as you can imagine,
the scale they jumped up quite a bit,
almost 50 times what their
normal scale would see.
So that practically
happened overnight.
So we worked very
closely with Blackboard.
Again, our scale really allowed
us to be able to reconfigure
and get capacity built out
and configured in the sizes
and the families that they needed.
So we were able to do that.
The other thing that we did
was work closely with Blackboard
to provide additional flexibility.
So before they had a single
instance type that they could use,
we work with them to qualify 2
or 3 different and instance types,
which really allowed them
to expand the amount of capacity
that they could scale into,
which helped because they
didn't have a lot of visibility
into how high they
would actually go.
So we really were able
to work closely with them
and stay ahead of any
of the different spikes
as they went from saw spikes
in Europe for one part of the day,
saw spikes in Middle East
for the other part of the day,
and then finally spikes in the US.
And we were able to provide
the capacity that they needed
so that they had a very
successful COVID experience.
Fantastic.
Well, that's a great example,
Scott, and thanks for sharing that.
And thanks for joining me today
to share a little bit of the details
behind the scenes of what we
had to do in the capacity side
to make sure that we met the demand
from our customers during this year.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
It's just incredible what
the teams were able to achieve
during these challenging times,
and it was fantastic
to be able to help support
so many of our customers as
demand for their businesses spiked.
Next, let's take a look at some
of the critical business workloads
that we needed to support
during the pandemic.
One of my favorite all
time sports is Formula1,
and it's a lot of fun
working with them
on critical innovations
within the sport.
With the pandemic, there was
limited access to wind tunnels.
So all design has to move to high
performance computing workloads,
running computational
fluid dynamics.
Formula 1 utilized over
12,000 hours of compute time
in designing the car for
the 2021 racing season.
As Pat calls out in this quote,
the project was one of
the most revolutionary
in the history of
Formula 1 aerodynamics.
But they were also able
to reduce the runtime from 60 hours
to just 10 hours by using our
latest compute optimized instances
with 100 gigabits of
network in throughput.
To run and scale
workloads like this,
we bring together the latest compute,
networking,
storage,
security and cloud orchestration
to offer a secure,
highly customizable
and cost effective high
performance computing platform.
Over the last two years,
we've invested significantly
to provide a great foundation for HPC
and as a result,
the industry has recognized AWS
as a proven leader
for HPC in the cloud,
awarding us best HPC cloud
platform for three years running.
And now let's take a look at
another high scale workload
that requires tremendous
compute power and something
that I'm sure we all
are well familiar with.
Weta is the ultimate
world builder.
To deliver these films
it takes tremendous talent,
bespoke software,
an enormous compute power.
Our compute needs
have drastically increased.
Also, remote working has become
an important component of our future.
That's why with AWS,
we are taking over
150 proprietary tools
and creating a robust
Weta cloud based pipeline,
Weta can then hire any
artists around the world
and empower them with our toolset
and nearly infinite compute
to continue our film making magic.
Wow, it's amazing to see
what Weta have been doing
with the power of AWS.
So we've covered
capacity and scale.
Let's take a closer
look at optimization.
Across all workloads,
cost is being at the top
of customers minds.
This past year, many
customers had to face the trade-off
of driving innovation
or reducing cost.
Our focus has been
to help customers do both.
With graphics intensive applications
growing in popularity on AWS,
we thought we should take a look
at optimizing access to GPUs.
So yesterday in Andy's keynote,
we announced G4ad
offering the best price
performance for graphics
intensive workloads in the cloud.
Powered by AMD's second
generation epic processors
and their latest AMD
Radeon PRO V520 GPUs
for applications like remote
workstations, games streaming
and rendering. Just incredible.
I wanted to look back to our
AMD portfolio of instances,
much of which has been
focused on providing you
with fantastic
performance at 10 percent
or more cost savings
for x86 workloads.
Since our very first
AMD instances in 2018,
we have steadily
grown the portfolio
and it has been a great
partnership with the team at AMD.
Earlier this week I caught up with
Lisa Su, President and CEO of AMD,
to discuss our partnership
and some of our recent launches
and what all of that
means to AMD customers.
Let's take a look.
Well, welcome, Lisa,
and thank you for joining me today.
You know, AMD's a valued partner.
Today,
we now have 9 EC2 instance families,
spanning more than 20 global regions
powered by the AMD Epic processors.
And countless number of
our customers are seeing
great value and performance
in AMD powered EC2 instances.
Thank you, Dave,
for the opportunity to be here.
And AWS is a very
key partner for AMD.
And we've had such a strong
partnership over the last few years.
Our mission at AMD is
really to push the envelope
on high performance
computing products
and with AWS, together we're offering
tremendous compute capability
to our joint customers.
AWS first announced the AMD
based EC2 instances in 2018
and delivered 10 percent lower
cost to customers in our core EC2
general purpose and memory
optimized instance families.
Lisa, from an AMD perspective,
how easy was it to get AMD
up and running in the cloud?
Well, you know, I think we have
two very strong teams on our side,
you know, designing
the products and on your side,
really bringing compute
to the marketplace
very quickly and efficiently.
So we've been able to see
just a seamless transition
for AWS customers to move
workloads to AMD based instances.
With our x86 code compatibility.
And with our high performance,
CPUs customers can
transition to these AMD instances
and get much better
value in the process.
So whether you're talking about
AI or database and analytics,
we've seen some great results.
So we're very excited
about what we've been
able to accomplish together.
Well, Lisa,
the reception for AMD instances
has been overwhelmingly positive.
Customers like the 10
percent lower costs,
the application compatibility and
the seamless migration experience
for x86 workloads.
In fact, they wanted more.
And so earlier this year,
we introduced compute optimized
C5A and C5D instances
powered by the second
generation AMD Epic processors.
Lisa, how is that being an important
instance for AMD and your customers?
Yeah, so we're very
excited about the expansion
in the portfolio with AWS.
You know,
we have three different types
of AMD powered instances to meet,
you know, general-purpose needs,
memory optimized needs,
as well as the new C5A instances
around compute optimization.
And it really helped to fill
out the overall portfolio.
I would say, again, this is a great
example of our joint collaboration
to bring the highest performance,
x86 processors to AWS customers.
And we've had a number of
industry leaders already adopt C5A,
including Airbnb,
Expedia and Capital One.
And I know that, you know,
our customers are
always looking for more.
So it's just a great opportunity.
Yes. And in fact,
in Andy's keynote this week,
we referenced that we
bringing AMD GPUs to the cloud
with the EC2 G4AD instances,
G4AD feature both the second
generation AMD Epic's CPUs
as well as the AMD Radeon Pro GPUs
and provides customers
with up to 45 percent
better price performance in
the cloud for graphics workloads.
Yeah, it's very, very exciting.
So you know Qiqi expansion
and when you think
about 45 percent
it is a big number with
tremendous value for our customers.
You know,
I think our goal is to provide
the best price
performance for graphics
intensive applications
here in the cloud.
And whether you're talking
about remote graphics workstations
or the virtual desktop VDI
environments or video transcoding
or some of these
photorealistic design applications
or even games streaming,
you know, all of these applications
need high performance graphics
and we're proud to partner
with AWS in this space.
And certainly we've seen high
demand for graphics workloads.
And this is another way
to help customers reduce costs
with just a few lines of code.
Look, I think, you know,
it's really just amazing to see
how much we've been able
to accomplish in our partnership
over the last few years,
Dave, I think the innovation,
the collaboration,
the focus on what our joint
customers need has been fantastic.
And I really look forward to doing
even more together in the future.
Well, Lisa, I want to thank
you for joining us today.
It's been an incredible
partnership over the last two years.
And I look forward
to everything else
we're going to do together
going forward. Thank you.
Fantastic.
It was great being here, Dave.
It's amazing to see what we
have been able to achieve together
in just a little more
than two years.
We're looking forward
to what the future holds here.
With many customers
working remotely this year,
more than ever,
we have seen customers
rethinking where
traditional applications live
and how they can make the cloud
their primary model
for all applications.
Due to health and safety
concerns for the IT staff,
companies have
struggled with maintenance
or adding compute
and storage capacity.
More than ever, customers are
thinking about how they can have
a fully managed
infrastructure model like they do
in the cloud for applications
that need to remain on premises.
But before we get there,
let's take a look
at our global infrastructure.
Footprint and reliability matter.
And we have the broadest footprint
of networking services
around the world
that make it easy
to connect into the cloud
more than any other provider.
Currently, AWS offers the most
multi-AZ regions in the cloud,
which is two times more
than the next largest provider.
We have a high operational
bar for our regions,
so unlike other providers,
we do not build regions
with only a single
availability zone.
Also, our availability zones
are placed at a distance apart
to prevent the chance
of correlated failure.
It's really interesting
to see where other providers
have cut corners
in this critical area.
So once again, I encourage
you to catch Peter's keynote,
next week Thursday,
for more details.
The AWS backbone spans the globe
and carries all traffic
between our regions.
CloudFront PoPs and
our Direct Connect location.
Every fiber here is controlled by
Amazon and is either leased or owned.
Importantly, all of this
infrastructure can be used
to bring the cloud closer to you.
Customers have
a continuum of workload types,
some of which can easily
be moved to AWS regions,
some of which are harder due
to data residency regulations
and some that need
to remain on premises
or at the edge for
the foreseeable future,
due to low latency and local
data processing requirements.
This year, and especially this year,
the world is a bigger place,
but also a smaller one.
For some industries like
real time multiplayer gaming
latency really matters and
having compute capacity
that is close to the users
is critical for performance.
Also, some governments have
more governance over industries
in health care, financial services
and require applications
for those services
to stay within their borders.
All of these are
examples of industries
that we have been working
with to extend the cloud
to service their needs.
In this section, we're going
to take a look at three areas.
First, AWS Outposts,
bringing AWS infrastructure
to virtually any data center,
co-location space or
on premises facility.
Second, AWS Local Zones,
bringing AWS services
to large population centers.
And finally, our third,
offering AWS Wavelength,
bringing AWS
services to mobile edge
computing locations
within 5G mobile networks.
Let's kick it off
with AWS Outposts.
We announced Outposts at re: Invent
last year and it's been a big year.
Customers have loved the offering,
providing the same.
AWS designed infrastructure
within their own data centers.
In the last year,
we have expanded to 51 countries
and significantly expanded
the available services on Outposts,
including RDS, ALB.
EMR,
ElastiCashe and more recently, S3
and customers have been
able to quickly migrate workloads
to the Outposts through the single
management plan in the cloud.
I recently caught up
with Meena Gowdar,
Principal Product
Manager of AWS Outposts
to hear more about what
the Outpost team has been up to.
Let's take a closer look.
Welcome Meena and thank you
very much for joining me today.
We launched Outposts
a little over a year ago now
at re:Invent last year.
And I'm interested to hear what
are you hearing from customers
on Outposts,
especially during COVID?
Thank you, Dave.
Today, more than ever,
customers recognize they want
more agility in their infrastructure
and are looking for pathways
to get them to a common
and fully managed cloud model,
even for their on
premises environment.
Outpost is a way for
them to achieve that goal
and accelerate their
migration to AWS.
Customers love that they deploy
and manage apps just like in AWS.
We deliver and install and set
up Outposts for our customers
and they are up and
running in just a few hours.
That's amazing. And can you take
us through some of the key use cases
that you see customers
doing with Outposts?
Sure. Some of the key use cases
we see are low latency,
local data processing
data residency use cases
and cloud migration as well.
And we're seeing
adoption across the globe
in a broad number of industries,
manufacturing, health care,
gaming, financial services, media
and entertainment and many others.
For example, Ride games.
They are an AWS customer,
had a global launch
of their multiplayer
fast action game called Walrond.
Under a very tight
deployment timeline,
customers like Ride wanted
to ensure an engaging,
high quality experience for all
their players across the globe.
Even in countries and metro areas,
far from AWS regions, Ride
games was able to deploy outposts
in four cities across
three countries
globally to support
their game launch.
Wow, that's incredible.
And the amount of time that they did
that in as well is just incredible.
Fantastic. Now, when we launched
Outposts at re:Invent last year,
we had a number of AWS
services available in Outposts.
We've added a number
of them over the last year.
And one of the ones we added
recently was S3 in Outposts.
And can you take us through
what is what new
opportunities it has S3 on.
Outposts opened up for customers?
Absolutely. S3 on Outposts
adds another storage option,
in addition to EBS, to even
better serve our customers' data
residency use case and
local data processing needs,
customers can use S3
APIs that they are
already familiar with
and they can add up to 96
terabyte of storage capacity
to an existing Outpost.
S3 on outpost helps
address use cases
where customers need to keep
their data within a country
or a state or any regulated area
where there is no AWS region today.
It also helps customers
with address use cases
where they have applications
that require high
throughput local processing,
such as medical imaging in
hospitals or autonomous vehicles
data processing and
manufacturing systems.
That's great to hear.
And partners play
such a critical role
in developing on premise
customer solutions with Outposts.
And can you take
us through a little bit
about what we've
been doing with partners
to build a partner
ecosystem for Outposts?
Yeah,
our partners are very excited
to bring their solution
and services on Outposts.
We have an app and consulting
partner program composed of partners
who provide a system integration,
consulting and implementation
services and solutions.
We launched an AWS Outpost
Ready program in September
this year with 32
technology and ISP partners.
In just the last couple of months,
the number of partners
who are certified under this
program have more than doubled.
We're super excited
to see the momentum here.
Outposts Ready partners fully
test their solution on Outposts.
They follow the AWS security
and architecture best
practices as part of the program.
Well, that's amazing.
And I'm sure one of the questions
everybody's interested in
is what's next on
the road map for Outposts?
So today,
Outpost is available in 51 countries,
22 AWS regions,
and we're not stopping there.
We're continuing to roll out
new countries and regions
to meet our customer demand.
We have launched
eight AWS services.
We have load balancers,
RDS, ECS, EKS.
We talked about S3 and we will
have more options in the next year
that provide more flexibility
for a broad range of
customer applications.
The technology and learnings
from Outposts enable us to innovate
and deliver new form factors
to address additional use
cases like outposts in hospitals,
manufacturing plants and retail
locations where space is constrained.
Meena, thank you very
much for coming to talk to us.
It's amazing to see how
much progress you've made
just in one year on Outposts.
I know the next year is
going to be just as good.
So thanks again for coming in.
Wow, such a great update,
and I'm super excited
with the use cases that
customers are solving with Outposts.
It really is a dynamic offering
that allows you to bring
the fully managed AWS cloud
into your own on premise facility.
With that said, earlier today
we announced AWS outposts
in two new sizes.
These will be available in both 1U
and 2U form factors
specifically designed
for smaller compute workloads
and to fit into industry
standard racks.
We have also simplified
the installation process
to allow either your own team or
a third party to install the device.
Both sizes will provide
64 virtual CPUs,
128 gigabit memory
and 4 terabytes of
local and NVMe storage.
And as with the Full Outpost rack,
these new form factors
offer the same AWS infrastructure,
services, APIs and tools.
These are going to be great
for retail stores, offices, hospitals
and other locations where
only a few servers are needed.
Let's talk a little bit
about AWS Local Zones.
Local Zones are a new type of
AWS infrastructure deployment
that places AWS
compute storage databases
and other select services
closer to large population centers
were no AWS region exists today.
Also,
Local Zones are fully managed by AWS,
so customers do not need
to think about the data center
or capacity management.
Last year we
announced Local Zones,
and we now have two
Local Zones in Los Angeles
for highly available applications.
Netflix and Mind Body are
two examples of customers
achieving low latency
for their applications
through the Los
Angeles local zones.
We have also seen
continued need from customers
for bringing compute
closer to other US areas
for applications which
need lower latency.
And thus we just
announced the availability
of three additional Local Zones
in Boston, Houston and Miami

that are available
in preview today.
And we will launch
12 more Local Zones
in major metropolitan
areas in 2021
to help customers
achieve single digit
millisecond latencies
across the United States.
Finally, AWS Wavelength is an AWS
infrastructure offering
optimized for mobile edge
computing applications
within 5G networks.
5G is here.
The iPhone 12 is a 5G device
and all the other major manufacturers
offer a 5G capable phone.
Telecom operators worldwide
are investing billions of dollars
to roll out 5G networks.
5G wireless technology is designed
to deliver almost 10 times
LTE peak data speeds,
ultra low latency, more reliability
and massive network capacity.
The combination
of all these factors
will help 5G drive
innovation in many industries
from augmented and virtual reality,
autonomous vehicles,
smart cities
to remote health care.
5G opens the door for
so many opportunities
to develop new
innovative applications,
and we're excited to see what our
customers do with AWS Wavelength.
Wavelength places
AWS infrastructure
at the 5G network edge
to eliminate the extra network hops
and makes AWS services,
APIs and tools available
to developers to build,
deploy and manage
the latency sensitive components
of their applications at the 5G edge,
just like they do in AWS regions.
Wavelength became generally
available in August with Verizon
and we have seven
Wavelength zones across the US.
Today, I'm excited to announce
an eighth Wavelength zone
with Verizon in Las Vegas
and we continue
to partner with Verizon,
KDDI, SK Telecom and Vodafone
to bring AWS Wavelengths
to countries around the world.
Taking a step back.
We have the broadest
portfolio of options
to bring AWS services
to where you need them
for all of your applications
delivering the same AWS experience.
Our mission is to build the compute
platform for every workload,
and our goal has been
to help businesses of all shapes
and sizes not just
survive but thrive.
We continue to build
the cloud for scale,
price performance and
security with the global coverage
you need for all
your applications.
While we are not
together in Vegas,
I encourage you to take
advantage of all the power
that a virtual re:Invent offers.
Over three weeks in December
and in January,
you have the opportunity to attend
all the sessions you
want with a front row seat.
Join online and find what
sessions you need and we'll here.
In addition to Swami's ML keynote
and Peter's infrastructure keynote,
here are a few compute sessions
that I would highly recommend.
Have a great re:Invent and thank you
for trusting AWS with your business.
