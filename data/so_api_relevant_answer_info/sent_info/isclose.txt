According to the [documentation (hyper-link)] , np.isclose()uses this formula:
The [math.isclose (hyper-link)] function [was introduced in Python 3.5 (hyper-link)], which is why you cannot import it.
3.5+), or define your own isclose function, the math module's is defined almost like the following:
The easiest way to obtain the isclose function is to simply copy the code into a file and import it:
And then check if the isClosed() returns true or not.
isClose() is only guaranteed to return true if the connection was closed by a call to Connection.close().
If the connection was closed due to some errors, isClose() will not necessarily return true.
isValid() does the opposite of isClose().
isClosed() :- If we call close() on connection or any fatal errors occurred over connection then it's return true.
As per your title  if you want to use math.isclose(), I ended up with:
math.isclose(a, b, rel_tol, abs_tol)
However isClosed() is not an expensive operation, it simply returns the boolean that is tracking the state of the statement.
You mention that your use-case is np.isclose.
If it were: numpy.isclose(measured, expected, ...) (or something like it) it would be much clearer.
For example if you expect the value 10 and measure 10.51 and you allow for 5% deviation, then in order to get a useful result you must use np.isclose(10.51, 10, ...), otherwise you would get wrong results:
That's a bit like changing the numerator and denominator for division because the denominator contains zeros and dividing by zero could give NaN, Inf, a Warning or an Exception... it definetly avoids the problem but just by giving an incorrect result (the comparison isn't perfect because with division it will almost always give a wrong result; with isclose it's rare).
There was some discussion about this topic when math.isclose was added to the python library:
This proposal [for math.isclose] uses a symmetric test.
So if your test falls into the first category and you like a symmetric test - then [math.isclose (hyper-link)] could be a viable alternative (at least if you're dealing with scalars):
How is isConnected different than isClosed, and what is the real behavior of each?
Yes, you can use numpy's isclose
You should use isConnected() function instead of isClosed() in order to detect if the remote socket is closed.
isClosed only returns true once the socket is explicitly closed on your local end, not the peer's end.
Also, your method isClose() needs to tell that it returns boolean by changing from void to boolean (shown above).
Note:  If isclosed is a bit, then max() requires a conversion to a number.
You can always remove the isClosed()
So when using the MySQL JDBC driver, PreparedStatement.isClosed() will return true if the connection was closed.
In your case, I am not sure if the DBCP library is delegating the call to isClosed() to the underlying driver or not, that's why I recommend removing this extra layer and see what happens.
Alternatively, you can also first write a freeVars helper and implement isClosed via that:
this works great:
np.all(np.isclose(df1.as_matrix(),df2.as_matrix(),atol=1))
You'll need to have your main thread wait in isClose for the first onSensorChanged event, you can achieve this in many ways, but using a [Condition (hyper-link)] variable would probably be the easiest.
About the usefulness of isclose, one example could be sensor measurement.
[math.isclose (hyper-link)] tells you if two floats are close given the parameters rel_tol and abs_tol.
setting abs_tol to something <0.5 will make isclose True for something you have used round on:
Note that this query assumes that IsClosed is only ever 0 or 1.
Unfortunately, there are no ops that do exactly the same thing for allclose or isclose, but you can have workarounds.
isclose: combine tf.abs, tf.sub, tf.less or tf.less_equal.
allclose: based on isclose, use tf.reduce_all in addition
Please note that this test script is for Python 3.5.x due to math.isclose(), so it won't work with a default Squish binary package as those ship with Python 2.7.x (contact Squish technical support to obtain a Squish binary package with a different Python version).
Check out the [documentation for math.isclose() (hyper-link)]:
math.isclose(a, b, *, rel_tol=1e-09, abs_tol=0.0)
  Return True if the values a and b are close to each other and False otherwise.
With the new math.isclose() function, we can remedy that:
The default tolerance for math.isclose() is 1e-09, so we can use that:
So you could use a stronger threshold, either for manual checking or if using math.isclose() and passing in a value for rel_tol.
You don't need to use np.where for this - an array of booleans, like the one returned by np.isclose or the various comparison operators, works as an index to another array (provided the sizes match).
If drvr->connect(...) throws an exception, con will never be set to a valid pointer, so you can't call con->isClosed(), you're not pointing to a valid connection object.
You need to either move the isClosed() call into the try block, or restructure to bail out after detecting that connect() threw an exception.
It's not the code in the isClosed() function that is crashing your program, it's the fact you're calling that code on an invalid (potentially nullptr, you don't show your declaration/initialization) object, which is undefined behavior in C++.
I agree with you, it seems strange that isClosed provides the closed state only on a best effort basis, and that your code still has to be prepared to catch the exception when closing the connection.
I think the reason is that the connection may be closed at any time by the database, and so any status returned by a query state method like isClosed is intrinsicly stale information - the state may change between checking isClosed and calling close on the Connection.
JDBC operations execute with synchronous results, so all useful execution has either succeeded or failed by the time isClosed is called.
Looking at the source for SnaqDB [CacheConnection (hyper-link)], the isClosed method delegates to the underlying connection.
So the problem is not there, but lies with the defined contract for isClosed() and Connection.close() throwing an exception.
The variables numerator and current are both ints, so dividing them will give you an int, of which the closest you can get to pi is 3, which has more than 0.1 difference, meaning isClose will never return true, so you will never print anything out.
The problem is that as soon as you invoke a set("IsClosed", true) KendoUI redraws the grid so next grid.dataItem will not return what you expect.
The following will give you all rows with isClosed = @ViewClosedRecords.
If @ViewAllRecords = true then it will return all rows and ignore isClosed.
Socket.isClosed() and Socket.isConnected() only tell you what you have done to the socket.
I'd recommend you to use rowattr to add classes "ui-state-disabled ui-jqgrid-disablePointerEvents" if IsClosed contains "Yes".
As Kaiido said, isClosed was being pulled from localStorage as a string, which caused toggleClass to think the string of "false" was truthy, therefore still adding the 'nav-is-closed' class.
Adding JSON.parse when getting isClosed and adding JSON.stringify when setting isClosed in localStorage solves the problem.
This "round trip" comparison occurs when you set check_inverse=True, and it is passed to np.isclose.
When the connection is closed the isClosed()  method should return TRUE.
[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/net/Socket.html#isClosed-- (hyper-link)]
I think you have the IsClosed column as a computed column.
If you're using SQLite store type and the "isClosed" attribute is "Indexed" (a setting in your entity editor panel), you could have hundreds of thousands of orders and still have a nice, quick fetch time when filtering only for "isClosed == YES".
