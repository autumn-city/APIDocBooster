our bi-directional rna in this video if
you are not
seen my video on simple rnn which is
single direction rnn then
i suggest you what that because it's
kind of a prerequisite
in this video we'll just discuss theory
behind bi-directional rnn in the future
video will cover coding
say you are working on a named entity
recognization problem
and you want to figure out the apple
word that we're using
is what kind of entity is it so here
apple
is fruit and double is a person but when
you look at a different sentence like
this
apple here is a company it is not a
fruit
now if you observe the statement
carefully
the words which come prior to apple
they are same so until you look at the
sentence
after apple you won't know if apple is a
fruit or a company
now if you look at your simple rnn which
is a single direction
okay left to right then
the word apple will have
influence only the previous words which
is double laws
now people have a common confusion
when they look at the the graph like
this
the picture like this they think that
you know it's a three and three six
seven layer neural network but no
look at this axis x axis is a time axis
so this is
something you have to keep always in
your mind
that the actual network is just this
it's a simple network
but we feed word by
when we get a sentence we feed
every word one by one to this network
and then it kind of has a looping effect
okay so when you unroll that in time
you get a network like this so that
thing you need to keep in your mind all
the time that this is
a time access at time t 1 i am feeding
word double
getting my activation a1 then at time t2
when i feed this loves actually i'm
feeding it to the same network
same same layer okay so the actual
network is this but since it has a
looping effect
i unroll this in time and then
i get this picture
now simple rnn okay so i'm just
gonna show you the simple presentation
so i'm removing all those neurons and
everything
and this rectangle box that you see is
like a cell
single direction rnn then the output for
word apple will be influenced by
all these edges that you see in this
different color
so double loves apple so these
these are the words that influence the
final outcome
but we already saw that in order to
decide
whether apple is a fruit or a company
you need to look the
at the words which are coming after
apple
in the future so you need to make a
change
in your neural network for this so one
one way you can do this
is you add another layer which processes
the words from
right to left so think about this layer
okay so i already have this the previous
layer
layer you know the forward basically
single direction left to right a layer i
add a new layer which is in blue boxes
here
so it's a same kind of rnn
cells but the only difference is the
activation is going from
right to left okay so now what happens
is
when i decide whether uh apple is a
fruit or a company
see the output y3 hat
that output is a function of
a1 and a2 okay so basically you have the
influence of
double laws the previous words on your
y3 hat
but be watch this blue line but because
of this line
now you have influence of your future
words as well
so it keeps him healthy
so that sentence will have an impact
through this direction you know through
the direction that goes from right to
left
you get all the activation results and
these results
feed through this particular arrow
and you can make a decision so that's
all i had for
bi-directional rnn we just covered a
basic theory i did not go into math
a little bit you can maybe check other
resources for it
but i hope this video gives you a
simple you know simplistic understanding
of how bi-directional rnn works
in the future video we are going to
cover the
vectorization or word embedding
techniques
and then we will get into coding i know
in this series so far we have been doing
some theoretical videos
you all have been waiting for coding
we'll get to that
but before we get to the coding we need
to cover some essential concepts
so we'll get into word embeddings and
after that
we will write code to implement lstmgru
or you know bi-directional
rnn to solve some nlp problems all right
so
thank you very much goodbye
