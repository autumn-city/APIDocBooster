Then we will go on here again, it will receive receive the  hidden state and the cell state from the previous time step, the current time step input, output something and so forth. So that's how the LSTM cell class works."
So in basic sense, these are generally comprised of bi-directional LSTM cells or bi-directional. So generally we have the X as the input features and we have the hidden state from the previous timestamp of the previous cell.
LSTMCell is an object (which happens to be a layer too) used by the LSTM layer that contains the calculation logic for one step.
A recurrent layer contains a cell object.
LSTM is a recurrent layer.
 An LSTM layer is a RNN layer using an LSTMCell, as you can check out in the [source code (hyper-link)].
