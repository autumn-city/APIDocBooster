hey everyone in this video we're going
to be talking about how to install
pytorch in Visual Studio code on Windows
11. if you do not have Visual Studio
code installed yet on your PC click the
video in the top right hand corner of
your screen now or in the description
down below to quickly install Visual
Studio code on Windows 11.
so let's just get right into this
tutorial let's begin by opening up
visual studio code by heading to our
search bar and right-clicking it and
running it as an admin so as to avoid
any future permission errors
now let's go to our desktop and create a
brand new folder that we can use for our
PI torch project
so I'm just going to call it pytorch
project
now we need a python file to import
pytorch into right let's create a new
folder through this button here and name
it main.pi the dot Pi indicates that we
are creating a python file
now let's go up to view and open our
terminal window
as you can see we are indeed inside our
newly created folder on our desktop
based on this directory here
so in order to import libraries inside
our folder we should first create a
python virtual environment
to accomplish this let's head down to
our terminal and type python 3.10 or
whatever version of python you are
working with Dash m v e n v study
session
however you can replace study session
with whatever you wish to call your
virtual environment though
now if we go back to our File Explorer
on Visual Studio code you can see our
virtual environment is now here
also make sure that you are using the
correct interpreter after creating a
virtual environment like so
let's first activate our virtual
environment so that our terminal knows
we only want to work within this
environment we need to find and use this
activate file here through our terminal
that was created with our virtual
environment
so to get there from our pytorch folder
we enter study session scripts and then
activate and be sure you are using
forward slashes when moving between
folders
now you can see we're working within our
virtual environment based on the
parenthesis names here on the left of
our terminal line
to upgrade pip let's type pip3 install
dash dash upgrade pip and we will
install the latest version of pip
now to install pytorch to our virtual
environment let's type pip install torch
and you should see a download begin like
so
to validate the pi torch is now
installed correctly let's write the
following simple code that will print
out the version of pytorch that we just
downloaded
and this will prove that our library is
downloaded correctly and actually usable
thank you for checking out this video
and I hope it helped your understanding
of how to install pytorch in Visual
Studio code on Windows 11. hey everyone

install Visual Studio code on Windows
11.
so let's get right into this tutorial
let's begin by opening up visual studio
code by heading to our search bar and
right-clicking it and running as an
admin so as no potential permission
errors pop up later
now let's go on our desktop and create a
brand new folder that we will use for
our pandas project
so I'm just going to call it such
now inside Visual Studio code let's open
up our pandas project
we need a python file to import pandas
into right
so let's create a new file through this
button here and name it main.pi the dot
Pi indicates that you are creating a
python file
now let's go up to view and open up our
terminal window
as you can see here we are indeed inside
our newly created folder on our desktop
based on this directory here
in order to import libraries inside of
our folder we should create a python
virtual environment
to accomplish this let's head down to
our terminal and type python 3.10 or

to do so we need to access this activate
file here through our terminal that was
created with our virtual environment
so to get there from our pandas folder
we enter study session scripts and then
activate be sure you are using forward
slashes when moving between the folders
now you can see we are working within
our virtual environment because of these
parentheses names here on the left of

to upgrade pip let's type pip 3 install
dash dash upgrade pip and we will
install the latest version of pip
now to install pandas to our virtual
environment let's type pip install
pandas and you should see a download
begin like so
to validate the pandas is now installed
correctly let's write the following
simple code that creates a series which
is essentially a simple table with
counting integers corresponding to the
number of data inputs that we enter
and this will ensure that pandas is now
working within your virtual environment
thank you for checking out this video

in this video we're going to be talking
about how to install matplotlib in
Visual Studio code on Windows 11. if you
do not have Visual Studio code installed
yet on your PC click on the video in the
top right hand corner of your screen now
or in the description down below to
quickly install Visual Studio code on
Windows 11.
so let's get right into this tutorial
let's begin by opening up visual studio
code by heading to our search bar and
right-clicking it and running it as an
admin so no potential of permission
errors pop up later
now let's go on our desktop and create a
brand new folder this will be used for
our matplotlib project so I'm just going
to call it such
inside Visual Studio code let's open up
our map plotlib project
we need a python file to import
matplotlib into right
so let's create a new file through this
button here and name it main.pi
the pi indicating that we are creating a
python file
now let's go up to view and open our
terminal window
as you can see we are indeed inside our
newly created folder on our desktop
based on this directory here
so in order to import libraries inside
our folder we should create a python
virtual environment
to accomplish this let's head down to
our terminal and type python 3.10 or
whatever version of python you are
currently working with Dash m v e n v
and I'm going to call mine study session
in this line here you can replace study
session with whatever you wish to call
your virtual environment
now if we go back to our File Explorer
on Visual Studio code you can see that
our virtual environment is now here
also make sure you're using the correct
interpreter after creating your virtual
environment like so
so let's first activate our virtual
environment so that our terminal knows
we only want to work within this
environment
so we need to initiate this activate
file here through a terminal that was
created with our virtual environment
so to get there from our matplotlip
folder we enter study session scripts
and then activate
be sure you are using forward slashes
when moving between folders
now you can see we are working within
our virtual environment because of the
parentheses names here on the left of
our terminal line
to upgrade pip let's type pip 3 install
dash dash upgrade pip we will install
the latest version of pip
if you receive the following error could
not install packages due to an OS error
then all you need to do is come into our
python virtual environment config folder
and change include systems site
packaging to true
back into our main python file we can
start to install matplotlib to our
virtual environment to do so let's type
pip install map plot lip and you should
see a download begin like so
to validate this let's write the
following simple code that plots the
following set of data
then when we hit run we are presented
with our graph meaning that map plotlib
is now working

hey everyone in this video we're going
to be talking about how to install numpy
in Visual Studio code on Windows 11. if
you do not have Visual Studio code
installed yet on your PC click on the
video in the top right hand corner of
your screen now or in the description
down below to install it
so let's get right into this tutorial
let's begin by opening up visual studio
code we head down to our search bar
search Visual Studio code and right
click it and we're going to run it as an
admin so no potential permission errors
pop up later
now let's go on our desktop and create a
brand new folder this will be for our
numpy project so let's just call it this
inside Visual Studio code let's open our
numpy project
we need a python file to import numpy
into so let's create a new file through
this button here and name it main.pi the
pi indicating that we are creating a
python file
now let's go up to view and open our
terminal window
I'm going to open up a terminal in
command prompt like so
as you can see we are indeed inside our
newly created folder on our desktop
based on this directory here
so in order to import libraries into
this python project we should create a
python virtual environment
to accomplish this let's head down to
our terminal and type python 3.10 or
whatever version of python you want to
work with
Dash m v e n v and then I'm going to
call my virtual environment study
session you can replace this with
whatever you want though
now if we go back to our File Explorer
on Visual Studio code you can see our
virtual environment is now here
also make sure that you are using the
correct interpreter after creating your
virtual environment and you can do that
like so
let's first activate our virtual
environment so that our terminal knows
that we only want to work within this
environment
so we need to initiate this activate
file here through our terminal that was
created with our virtual environment
to get there from our numpy folder we
enter study session scripts and then
activate and be sure to be using forward
slashes when moving between folders
now you can see we're working within our
virtual environment because of these
parentheses named here on the left of
our terminal line
to upgrade pip let's type pip3 install
dash dash upgrade pip and we will
install the latest version of pip or
it'll tell you you have the current
version
now to install numpy to our virtual
environment we simply type pip install
numpy and you should see a download
begin like so
to validate that numpy is working let's
write the following simple code that
creates a simple Matrix to ensure that
numpy is actually working within our
virtual environment
when we hit run we are presented with
this Matrix here which means numpy is
not working
