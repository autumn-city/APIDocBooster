"When using dispatchTouchEvent , you take all touches in your activity, if you want only detect one touch, you have to filter the touch by its type, you can do this using the MotionEvent parameter. "
"Both Activity and View have method dispatchTouchEvent() and onTouchEvent.The ViewGroup have this methods too, but have another method called onInterceptTouchEvent.  The return type of those methods are boolean, you can control the dispatch route through the return value."
"Another difference is that if dispatchTouchEvent return 'false' the event dont get propagated to the child, in this case the EditText, whereas if you return false in onInterceptTouchEvent the event still get dispatch to the EditText "
