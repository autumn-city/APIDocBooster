This is an issue with some of the other answers above - do not try an re-implement server-side authentication mechanisms - this problem has been solved and is supported by most major browsers.
These URLs can (supposedly ...) only be resolved within "the company's internal network."
It solves code duplication.
It's a useful way to design methods when writing a library that will be reused, but it should be used sparingly in the core of your own program unless it really solves a code duplication problem.
Maintenance is the number one thing it solves for me.
In using a container like Castle Windsor, it solves maintenance issues even better.
OK, if we need to, but do we need to pick a brand new "bigger than life" name that confuses more than it solves?
It solves the problem of having to manually change every instantiation of one type of object to another.

I agree with @GregoryKlopper that the right way to solve the general problem of finding Waldo (or any object of interest) in an arbitrary image would be to train a supervised machine learning classifier.
Simply deleting the connection from "Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections" solved the problem.

On my Windows system, setting ServerRoot back to C:/XAMPP/apache solved the problem.
Even i had this issue and i resolved it, in my case it was different.
I first tried to run the "net stop http" command in an admin cmd, but it didnt solve the issue, so I went ahead to try the "netstat -abno" command and i found out that the ssl port(443) was in use by vmware.
So this is how you can solve this issue...
If changing the port didn't solve the problem as suggested above, and if you had probably played around with the file directory structure (for instance, change the name of the folder after installation like I did) then you can try this,
This issue can be resolved by making changes in your "httpd.conf"(C:\xampp\apache\conf\httpd.conf) file and "httpd-ssl.conf"(C:\xampp\apache\conf\extra\httpd-ssl.conf) file.
Turns out I did not connect

We can solve Q2 by summing both the numbers themselves, and the squares of the numbers.
Which we can then solve to determine our missing numbers.
No matter how big k is, the problem can be solved in constant time because you can use a set and remove numbers from the set in at most 100 - k iterations of a loop.
From the above two equations, solve for a and b through a quadratic equation.
I'd take a different approach to that question and probe the interviewer for more details about the larger problem he's trying to solve.
Assuming that the "bag" is represented by a 1-based array A[] of size N - k, we can solve Qk in O(N) time and O(k) additional space.
I asked a 4-year-old to solve this problem.
Now your unknown is 3 while you just have two equations you can solve from.
Just to prove that this can be solved without reading up on the solution first or being a genius:
You can solve Q2 if you have the sum of both lists and the product of both lists.
Then we can solve with the quadratic formula:
To solve the 2 (and 3) missing numbers question, you can modify [quickselect (hyper-link)], which on average runs in O(n) and uses constant memory if partitioning is done in-place.
The idea is to use a bit of randomization to hopefully 'spread' the k elements into independent sub problems, where our original algorithm solves the problem for us.
now it is easy to find x and y modulo 101 (solvea quadratic poly over the finite field with 101 elements).
I tried to solve it using set:
But as the question said we can't use an array of size N, I would use O(1) space complexity and k iterations i.e O(NK) time complexity to solve this.
If you want to solve the general-case problem, and you can store and edit the array, then [Caf's solution (hyper-link)] is by far the most efficient.
The solution I propose is the most efficient answer (so far on this thread) if you can store the array but can't edit it, and I got the idea from [Svalorzen's solution (hyper-link)], which solves for 1 or 2 missing items.
It could solve heap size problem.

Q: If PyPy can solve these great challenges (speed, memory consumption, parallelism) in comparison to CPython, what are its weaknesses that are preventing wider adoption?
A: First, there is little evidence that the PyPy team can solve the speed problem in general.
So PyPy didn't solve the memory consumption problem yet.
Whether PyPy solves the mentioned great challenges and will in general be faster, less memory hungry, and more friendly to parallelism than CPython is an open question that cannot be solved in the short term.
Because the different class loaders are in different security domains (according to Java) the JVM won't allow classes already loaded by the rootloader to be resolved in the runtime loader address space.

Is armadillo solve() thread safe?
Looking at the [code (hyper-link)] of solve_od all the variables accessed seem to be local.
If fixing lapack is not possible, a workaround is to stack your systems and solve a single large system.
The thread safety of Armadillo's solve() function depends (only) on the BLAS library that you use.
The Armadillo solve() function is not thread safe when linking to [the reference BLAS library (hyper-link)].
Of course, this only applies when you run solve() from multiple threads with different data.
A Library and a Framework are a set of classes, modules and/or code (depending of the programing language) that can be used in your applications and helps you to solve an especific "problem".
You can have a Framework or a Library to solve all these problems and many more, normaly the frameworks helps you to solve more complex or bigger problems, but that a consecuence of their main difference, not a main definition for both.
But for example a log library, you can just use a Log class in your code, and helps you to solve the "logging problem", that doesn´t mean that the log library doesn't have more classes in his code, like classes to handle files, handle screen outputs, or even data bases, but you never touch/use that classes in your code, and that is the reason of why is a library and not a framework.
Library solves a narrow range of tasks.
Framework solves a wide range of tasks(domain specific), you delegates this task to framework.
Adding this to the msbuild command line solved the problem for me:

You could use a new annotation to solve this:
To solve this issue, I changed one of the collections to FetchType.LAZY since it was okay for my use-case.
In my case @Fetch did solve my problem of MultipleBacFetchException but then causes LazyInitializationException, the infamous no Session error.
I solved by annotating:
Yeah, new branch, this should solve this without a --force, which I think generally is a major git drawback.
This will resolve the binaries to [solution]\packages\MSBuild.Microsoft.VisualStudio.Web.targets.nn.n.n.n\tools\VSToolsPath\

You can copy these to a references folder & commit,
Or just use them where they are at.

Not only would this solve your namespace problem, but it would make your code more robust, easier to maintain, and more efficient.
Several people have already shared some tricky and clever code that might help solve the problem.
In any case, inform the developers of both frameworks of the conflict, and make it clear that their failure to avoid and/or deal with it is causing you real business problems, which could translate into lost business revenue if unresolved.
Hopefully you'll be able to resolve the conflict as soon as possible.
If the collision is only at the static link level then you can choose which library is used to resolve symbols:
If foo.o and bar.o both reference the symbol rat then libdog will resolve foo.o's rat and libcat will resolve bar.o's rat.
@compatibility_alias will be able to solve class namespace conflicts, e.g.
However, this will not resolve any of the enums, typedefs, or protocol namespace collisions.

To use a union-find data structure to solve a maze, first the neighbor connectivity data is used to build the union-find data structure.
For me, typing config set stop-writes-on-bgsave-error no in a shell and restarting Redis solved the problem.

There are many ways to resolve this, but it most often is fixed by altering the mutex and task manager.
Now, it is fairly obvious to see how binary semaphores can be used to solve synchronization and mutual exclusion - they are essentially locks.

To solve that problem, you must not use a 32 bits UNIX timestamp to store your dates -- which means, when using MySQL, you should not use TIMESTAMP, but DATETIME (see [10.3.1.
The way that I resolved this issue was to register the COM via regsvr32.
Placing the correct version of the dependency in the folder resolved both errors.

I've solved this differently than many of the solutions presented here.
It takes about 2 s to read file and build trie, and around 50 ms to solve the puzzle.
The problem is now solved and laid out with full disclosure on 5 web pages.
I realize this question's time has come and gone, but since I was working on a solver myself, and stumbled onto this while googling about, I thought I should post a reference to mine as it seems a bit different from some of the others.
It solves your example board in 0.35ms (with an additional 6ms start-up time which is mostly related to loading the trie into memory).
Here is my java implementation: [https://github.com/zouzhile/interview/blob/master/src/com/interview/algorithms/tree/BoggleSolver.java (hyper-link)]

First you need to create a new instance of the Boggler class and then call the solve function with the grid as a parameter.
I solved this in c. It takes around 48 ms to run on my machine (with around 98% of the time spent loading the dictionary from disk and creating the trie).
I solved this perfectly and very fast.
I wrote my solver in C++.

[Fast Boggle Solver GitHub Repo (hyper-link)]
I have solved this in C#, using a DFA algorithm.
I know I am really late at the party but I have implemented, as a coding exercise, a boggle solver in several programming languages (C++, Java, Go, C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Julia, Lua, PHP, Perl) and I thought that someone might be interested in those, so I leave link here:
[https://github.com/AmokHuginnsson/boggle-solvers (hyper-link)]
Replacing this declaration with -export([solve/0]).
Speed issues solved.
Side note: This solver has became the default solver in sklearn LogisticRegression since version 0.22, replacing LIBLINEAR.
The solver uses a coordinate descent (CD) algorithm that solves optimization problems by successively performing approximate minimization along coordinate directions or coordinate hyperplanes.
Side note: According to Scikit Documentation: The “liblinear” solver was the one used by default for historical reasons before version 0.22.
It is faster than other solvers for large datasets, when both the number of samples and the number of features are large.
The SAGA solver is a variant of SAG that also supports the non-smooth penalty=l1 option (i.e.
This is therefore the solver of choice for sparse multinomial logistic regression and it’s also suitable very Large dataset.
Side note: According to Scikit Documentation: The SAGA solver is often the best choice.
In a general case, use solve:
If your problem is banded (which cubic splines it often is), then there's [http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.linalg.solve_banded.html (hyper-link)]
I just had the same issue, and spend about an hour trying to solve the problem.
So I renamed "C:\# IDE\eclipse 3.7\" to "C:\+ IDE\eclipse 3.7\" and that solved the problem.
I had the same issue on Ubuntu, and solved it by unpack all *.pack files in jdk directory.
I resolved this combination by upgrading to Eclipse 3.8.x.
I just had to modify it with the new location, and that solved this issue.
Adding the following lines to eclipse.ini file solved my problem immediately:
for numerical solution, you can use fsolve:
[http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.fsolve.html#scipy.optimize.fsolve (hyper-link)]
If you prefer sympy you can use [nsolve (hyper-link)].
It has many dynamic programming algorithms to solve nonlinear algebraic equations consisting:  
goldenSection, scipy_fminbound, scipy_bfgs, scipy_cg, scipy_ncg, amsg2p, scipy_lbfgsb, scipy_tnc, bobyqa, ralg, ipopt, scipy_slsqp, scipy_cobyla, lincher, algencan, which you can choose from.
Some of the latter algorithms can solve constrained nonlinear programming problem.
as mentioned above, you can also use 'Broyden's approximation' by replacing 'fsolve' with 'broyden1'.
An alternative to fsolve is [root (hyper-link)]:
As mentioned in other answers the simplest solution to the particular problem you have posed is to use something like fsolve:
You say how to "solve" but there are different kinds of solution.
Having accepted that we want numeric solutions something like fsolve will normally do all you need.
You can use nsolve of sympy, meaning numerical solver.
solves the issue.
I have similar issue and solved it by changing the permission of the respective files and folder worked for me.
At this point you could try LinearSolve[m,rhs], however in this case it reports
Here are some problems that Backbone solves for me in the JS/HTML space:
So to answer the question, it solves nothing only to provide a way (the backbone way) of structuring code with some slight automation in the REST side of things.
I was able to solve this by using:
That's why sympy.solve fails.
The only option you have is to solve the equation numerically.
Sympy offers the nsolve function for this purpose, which, as typical in numerical solvers, requires an estimate of the solution.
The SciPy fsolve function searches for a point at which a given expression equals zero (a "zero" or "root" of the expression).
You'll need to provide fsolve with an initial guess that's "near" your desired solution.
To solve in the complex space:
Look at what Solve is going to be given:
to Solve and that is perhaps less puzzling when Solve returns something with A in it.
The solve function can solve for sub-expressions provided they appear "as is" in the equation being solved.
For example, in the following code, solve returns an empty solution for testEq but it returns the correct solution for testEq2 which is the same equation rearranged in terms of Y/X.
If you look at the source code of the solve function it uses code like
Such a routine does not eliminate the need for human intervention, it just assists by allowing the user to state the relationship of interest and add that to the current equation(s) from which the implications are then deduced/solved.
Typically I think this can be resolved by forcing a clear:both rule on the last child-element of the #items_list.
Also, overflow: auto; might solve the problem but it causes other problems like showing the scroll-bar and is not recommended.
I'd like to repost some comments from [this thread (hyper-link)], where you can read up on the issue and the issue was solved.
This will solve vulnerabilities in your dependencies and can help you fix a vulnerability by providing simple-to-run npm commands and recommendations for further troubleshooting.
I solved this issue by repeatedly running the commands,
I solved this by deleting the node_modules folder and running npm i.
The question mark solves that problem as it fools IE into thinking the rest of the string (other src) is a query string, and therefore loading just the EOT file...
Other browsers will follow the specification and load just their required font type ...

Use the proper way of calling solve:
as recommended here: [http://www.mathworks.com/help/symbolic/solve.html (hyper-link)]
To solve your problem, you need to save your images in your PUBLIC PATH.
solve (not linsolve) has some flags that you can set which can make it faster:
There is a warning in the solve docstring that rational=False can lead to some equations not being solvable due to issues in the polys, so be aware that that's a potential issue.
I have found that solve can be very slow in jupyter notebook if you have run sp.init_printing() before your equations.
I have a module "equations" where I write my equations and solve them.
This could be resolved like this:
I wanted to solve this the right way - that is without suppressing the warnings and rightly disposing all disposable objects.
I solved adding another 'if' to manage objects in the 'utf8ize' function by @Konstantin (I've not used the other function) :
There is no magic bullet which will "solve" encoding problems; you have to understand what encoding you have, and then convert it.
The built-in solve has serious limitations.
The add-on function to_poly_solve can solve equations which contain radicals; I don't know what its limitations are.
One could use to_poly_solve package; see the [docs (hyper-link)].
Now one can add the equation Eq1 to the list of inputs of dSolve but there are two problems with that: One is that dSolve seems to prefer character inputs and the second is that dSolve doesn't seem to realize that there are 3 independent variables a, b, and c (it only sees 2 variables, b and c).
To solve the second problem, I differentiated the original equation to get a new differential equation, there were three problems with that: the first is Matlab evaluated the derivative of a with respect to t as 0, so I had to replace a with a(t) and such like for b and c (I called a(t) the long version of a).
The final problem with that is that the system is now under determined, so I had to get the initial values, here I could have solved for a(0) but Matlab seemed happy with using a(0) = b(0) + c(0).
Now back to the original first problem, to solve that I had to convert every sym back into a char.
Also I added t as the independent variable in dsolve.
The reason which I believe made the last one possible, is that summation(x, (i, 0, N)) evaluates to x*(N + 1) (effect of the summation function), while the Sum(x, (i, 0, N)) returned by the expansion remains a simple Sum object, therefore no substitution made for it after the inner expansion in the solve function.
For everyone landing here with a need to solve the problem and not just bypass it allowing everything.
For me the problem solved on the server side (as it should be) with no change in the code.
The steps to resolve are
If Solve isn't working for a matrix problem then the first thing to look at is the matrix problem without Solve so you can see if your dimensions all match up.
The issue is solved.
I just wanted to mark the problem as solved and provide reference to the solution.
The solution that worked for me was to use the following solver and not the Sympy solve() function:
Think how you would solve it using pen and paper.
You wouldn't substitute x 100 times, then solve it 100 times.
Instead solve it once for y, then put in the x-values:
It returns a 2x100 matrix because solve found two solutions.
Michael's answer did solve your problem but it might (or to say, would eventually) cause the O.S.
I solved this using JNA: [https://github.com/twall/jna (hyper-link)]
This is solved in Java version 1.6.0_23 and upwards.
The problem will be that you solve for an exact match R == R_cardan.
For the first example R, this gives the exact same solution as with solve.
Unlike C++ (for instance), C# does not need forward declarations to resolve circular references.
To solve the issue, create an interface −
I found this one tricky to solve as well.
It's not automatically resolved by a composer update because it's part of the configuration that's only applied from it's [recipe (hyper-link)] when you require a package for the first time.
What problem do these libraries solve exactly ?
They solve the streaming data problem (see [1 (hyper-link)] and [3 (hyper-link)]), that occurs within functional languages with lazy IO.
However, I never found this argument compelling in isolation; you can solve most resource management issues simply by separating resource acquisition from the lazy IO, like this: [see last example above]
This is essentially what pipes solves--it allows us to compose effectful co-routines with ease.
When you run into this issue where an equation can't be solved by manipulation of symbols (solving analytically), it's possible that it can still be solved by trying different numbers and getting to (or very close to) the correct answer (solving numerically).
You can convert your sympy solution to a numpy-based function, and use scipy to solve numerically.
This solves the equation as 0.69314718, which is what you expect.
To answer your question though what is 'x' the method Matrix.solve doesn't not know what 'X' is.
So you can basically use solve(t(A), b) and take the result's transpose to get x'.
For linear equations you can simply use linsolve():
Unfortunately that does not work with an or in the output of solve.
I then updated my Python version from 2.7.10 to 2.7.13, and it resolved the problems that I was experiencing.
Based on that answer, my problem was solved by running the pip install command with sudo prefixed:
It was resolved after upgrading pip:
It should solve the problem.
I could only solve it by upgrading the psycopg2 version from 2.6.2 to 2.7.3.
I had the same issue when installing the "Twisted" library and solved it by running the following command on Ubuntu 16.04 (Xenial Xerus):
I solved it on Centos 7 by using:
Finally solved it by disabling Comodo Auto-Containment.
don't properly address the problem of getting back the objects provided to the deferred's resolve() method because jQuery calls the done() and fail() callbacks with individual parameters, not an array.
That means we have to use the arguments pseudo-array to get all the resolved/rejected objects returned by the array of deferreds, which is ugly:
Now you can simply pass in an array of deferreds/promises and get back an array of resolved/rejected objects in your callback, like so:
If you're using angularJS or some variant of the Q promise library, then you have a .all() method that solves this exact problem.
When you use the [SOLVE (hyper-link)] function (from the [Symbolic Toolbox (hyper-link)]) you can specify the variables you want to solve for.
Try to_poly_solve on these.
It is a share package -- you have to enter load(to_poly_solve); before calling it.
Now lets show a method somewhat similar to Solve that might work for you.
I doubt you can solve complex problems, because the input is lenght-limited.

I had the same problem and I found that is quite simple to solve (in my case).
Run svn up again: a menu will be showed allowing you to edit/resolve/accept/... a particular configuration:

I solved it with:
In this situation, you might not even need to use solve!
All you want to do is solve the equation:
now it's a quadratic which we can easily solve,
So you can use optimize.fsolve for it.
Sympy can solve this equation if you specify an integer power for y (ie y**3.0 changed to y**3).
For nonlinear equations, you should use sympy.solvers.nsolve to solve it numerically, except for some special cases where a more specific and appropriate solver may exist (e.g.
tsolve).
Assuming you mean you were trying to use sympy, as opposed to scipy, then you can get Sympy (works with v0.7.2+) to solve it by making a small adjustment to way you defined your equation - you just need to put a multiplication operator (*) in between the first 'y' and the '('.
rubygems-bundler solves this.
So to solve I ran the following commands:
The latter solved my issue actually but everyone keeps saying install @vue/cli.
Trying to solve it in the database is weird.
As I indicated in my comment above, [sym/solve (hyper-link)] is primarily meant to solve for analytic solutions of equations.
Some equations can have an infinite number of numeric solutions (e.g., periodic equations), and thus, as per [the documentation (hyper-link)]: "The numeric solver does not try to find all numeric solutions for [the] equation.
MuPAD's [numeric::solve (hyper-link)] function has several additional capabilities.
My [answer to this question (hyper-link)] provides other way that various MuPAD solvers can be used, particularly if you can isolate and bracket your roots.
While this is not a bug per se, The MathWorks still might be interested in this difference in behavior and poor performance of sym/solve (and the underlying symobj::solvefull) relative to MuPAD's solve.
In sympy you can add b like solve(expr - b, t) or solve(Eq(expr, b), t).
The issue here is that the argument to solver.check are extra assumptions the solver can make as it solves the constraints, not the actual constraints to check.
This would match what solve does.
If you replace the last line by Solve[cond] then Mathmatica automagically chooses the free variables and you'll get the solution.
The final output can also be obtained using Solve[x==1&&y==2], where Mma guesses the free variables.
In Mathematica 8 a new option for Solve (and related functions) called [MaxExtraCondtions (hyper-link)] was introduced.
This allows Solve to give solutions that use the new [ConditionalExpression (hyper-link)] and is intended to make the behaviour of solve more consistent and predictable.
So to solve the problem, you just need to get "Desktop development with C++" workload.
a previous error might be resolved by installing [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019 (hyper-link)];

You can use least square method in python to solve system of equations
for example for solving equations 3x+4y=7 and 5x+6y=8
You can write a simple function which solves a system of linear equations.
For example, if you want to solve the system of linear equations
I solved this problem by using:
For anyone using docker, I ran into this issue, and resolved it by using my own Dockerfile instead of the php:fpm image:
Now, we may attempt to solve it directly
Unfortunately, solve fails to find the solution in this case.
NSolve is not really the right tool for the job.
If your equations involve only linear functions or polynomials, then
  you can use NSolve to get numerical approximations to all the
  solutions.
Then the equations can be solved:
So what solved the whole thing for me was running:
spsolve does not return an 2d array but a 1d vector.
This probably also solves your second issue, related to the depth of the result vector.
However, for this particular system that you have at hand, I would simply invert the equations (1) and (3), which would yield a lower triangular system, that is easy to solve for Matlab (no need for iterative methods which can be very sensitive to the condition number.
In your case, since the matrix is symmetric, Matlab might try to solve it using cg, which is an iterative method).
Edit: On my matlab 2009, I do not get any warning while trying to solve this system (using the \ command).
Note that nsolve internally uses the multiprecission library mpmath and needs a set of initial values.
In SymPy if you want numerical solutions you should use nsolve:
You can get more digits of accuracy using the prec argument to nsolve:
You use the function solve, the function solve decided to call the quadprog function in order to solve your system of equation.
You need to specifically choose the right solver (in your case fminunc):
It is notoriously difficult to implement a robust QP solver.
If the code is short and uses SVD and LU, then it's probably a simple solver for problems with only equality constraints or no constraints at all.
QP with inequality constraints can be solved using tools such as quadprog(matlab), quadprog++(c++), mosek(matlab and c++).
You could try to solve it with Python's [sympy (hyper-link)].
Use [matlabFunction (hyper-link)] to convert your symbolic expressions to a vectorized numeric function that can be directly used by fsolve:
This will be an order of magnitude faster than using the the symbolic expressions themselves in fsolve.
With MATLAB's symbolic solver, I find an imaginary solution to your problem.
To confirm this, I tried MATLAB's numerical solver fsolve.
If you only care about numeric solutions, don't use solve.
If you just want a numeric solution, use nsolve:
If your equation is nonlinear and you have access to MATLAB optimization toolbox you can use the fsolve function (You can still use it for a linear equation, but it may not be the most efficient approach).
Define your function to solve:
Then call fsolve with an initial guess:
I don't know anything about RX in particular, but usually this problem gets solved by adding native support for asynchronous computation in the programming language.
Just answer the question: could you please also show how RX solves the "callback hell problem" on that simple example?
To address the question of how Rx solves callback hell:
To solve this in RxJs you could do something like so:
promise callback has two options either it is resolved or reject.
Suppose your API call is successful you can call resolve and pass data through the resolve, you can get this data by using then().
Remember a promise always use then for resolve and catch for reject
Let's solve the previous callback hell problem using a promise.
Now we can write another method call allRecipeOfAPublisher like getRecipe which will also return a promise, and we can write another then() to receive resolve promise for allRecipeOfAPublisher, I hope at this point you can do it by yourself.
In the above example, we used an async function because it will run in the background, inside async function we used await keyword before each method which returns or is a promise because to wait on that position until that promise fulfilled, in other words in the bellow codes until getIds completed resolved or reject program will stop executing codes bellow that line when IDs returned then we again called getRecipe() function with a id and waited by using await keyword until data returned.
To use await we will need a async function, we can return a promise so use then for resolve promise and cath for reject promise
With this approach, the termination issues were resolved.
Even though it may look simple to you, because a and b are not values, solve doesn't know the properties of these functions in order to apply basic rules of algebra (e.g., associative, distributive).
Of course if you explicitly define a and b then solve may work fine, but you'll need to solve for the variables in the functions not a and b themselves.
In your second case, solve assumes that at and bt are scalar algebraic variables.
solve finds no solution" is not helpful.
I think you're trying to solve linear simultaeneous equations.
Note that if the system is fully constrained (that is, if there are n independent constraints on the n equations you want to solve) then there will only be one solution and it may not necessarily be an integer solution.
if you want to solve an equation or a system of equations and conditions then you need to define them as such, so let me explain.
When you don't set a range it works just fine, if you can use the solve function then there also isn't a problem.
If you use solve you have some nice options where you can use assume to set extra conditions that are a bit more advanced, like only checking for real solutions or only integers, etc.
Lowering the threshold would not solve the fact that some jobs do not properly cleanup after they finish.
As I already addressed in a comment, the solve function isn't geared to solve such equations.
Regarding fsolve, it appears that the problem is caused because you are using the sin, cos and exp functions from sympy.
As discussed in the comments, your MATLAB installation does not seem to use the function in ...\toolbox\symbolic\symbolic\solve.m when a solve command is issued; instead, an unrelated function provided by the maple toolbox is used, leading to some confusion.
This issue can be solved by reordering the MATLAB search path:
SymPy recently got a new Linear system solver: linsolve in sympy.solvers.solveset, you can use that as follows:
You can solve in matrix form Ax=b (in this case an underdetermined system but we can use [solve_linear_system (hyper-link)]):
In the case of a square A we could define b and use A.LUsolve(b).
For the underdetermined linear system of equations, I tried below and get it to work without going deeper into sympy.solvers.solveset.
But look at what happens when you try to solve simultaneous polynomial equations like this.
So 4 of them will be equivalent to an eighth order polynomial, if you will try to solve it symbolically.
Their [solver (hyper-link)] looks like what you need.
As a beginner you should probably not attempt to solve such a non-trivial problem.
There are a few different ways to solve equations.
For more complicated expressions, have a look at scipy.fsolve.
If you only want to solve the extremely limited set of equations mx + c = y for positive integer m, c, y, then this will do:
If you want to recognise and solve arbitrary equations, like sin(x) + e^(i*pi*x) = 1, then you will need to implement some kind of symbolic maths engine, similar to maxima, Mathematica, MATLAB's solve() or Symbolic Toolbox, etc.
To solve it numerically, you have to first encode it as a "runnable" function - stick a value in, get a value out.
If you need it to be perfect, or if you want to try solving families of equations analytically, you have to turn to a more complicated beast: a symbolic solver.
A symbolic solver, like Mathematica or Maple, is an expert system with a lot of built-in rules ("knowledge") about algebra, calculus, etc; it "knows" that the derivative of sin is cos, that the derivative of kx^p is kpx^(p-1), and so on.
I had this problem and i solve it like that.
You can discard the initial guesses/dummies if you use [linsolve (hyper-link)]:
And then you can use [nonlinsolve (hyper-link)] for your non linear problem set.
print(nsolve((eq1, eq2, eq3), (x,y,z), (-50,50,50)))
If you're using a numerical solver on a multidimensional problem, it wants to start from somewhere and follow a gradient to the solution.
I spent several days to solve this problem.
Here are the solutions that I found on the internet and for each of them, there is at least on person who his problem has been solved with that solution.
So it will not help to solve this error.
Because there are some people who solved their problem with following these steps.

It solved my problem and also increased my speed dramatically.
There is no simple and unique way to solve this problem.
In my case, the problem was solved by editing the /etc/mysql/my.cnf file.
Oh, and you MIGHT have to still change your bind address to either 0.0.0.0 or 127.0.0.1 like outlined in the posts above, but clicking that box alone will probably solve your problems if you are a MAMP user.
I just restarted MySQL (following a tip from here: [https://stackoverflow.com/a/14238800 (hyper-link)]) and it solved the issue.
Hope it will solve your problem.
After years having the same issue and no permanent solution this is whats solved it for the past 3 weeks (which is a record in terms of error free operation)
The answer you requested from solve depends on the number of terms in the summation.
Change the second arguments of both sums from simply j to j= a..b. I did this, and then I got a simple answer from solve.
I don't think sympy will solve functional equations like this in the way you want, but you could separate your particular equation into two: 2y+z = 1/x and 2z+y = x where y(1/x) = z(x) and let sympy solve for both y and z:
Solved the issue by adding .conf extension to site configuration files.
I'm minimizing the absolute value because numeric accuracy issues make this problematic for numeric root-finder fsolve.
We can pick off the numeric value of lambda (which "solved" the integration).
As Oscar pointed out, dsolve failed to solve the ODE, because only one initial condition was required.
However, both conditions are required in order to 1) solve the ODE and 2) determine the parameter k. Which must be done separately.
Passing additional options of 'Real', true to solve gets rid of most of these extraneous conditions.
You probably should avoid calling the version of solve which accepts a string, and use the Symbolic Toolbox instead (syms 'r')
Here is how you could use [solve (hyper-link)] with symbolic variables:
As @BenVoigt suggests, you can try the 'Real' option for [solve (hyper-link)].
See [this answer of mine (hyper-link)] for an explanation of when and why fzero fails (although it won't for a Bessel function, it's good to be aware) and the tradeoffs with fsolve.
You can use dynamic programming technique to iteratively solve the problem:
For unconstrained non-linear optimization (according to your last edit) use [fminsearch (hyper-link)] to solve your problem.
To control the options, parameters of solver see [optimset (hyper-link)]
I solved my problem.
This solved the problem with solve()
This caused both solve() and solve_poly_system() to exit with
When the order was different, files' manipulation has been giving a wrong system to solve.
For this reason, solve(), solve_poly_system() raised the NotImplementedError.
Finally, the arguments of solve_poly_system( seq, *gens, **args) from the way I used them, they mean
According to these variables I solved my   system.
By correcting it, I solved this error.

I had the same issue and solved by using Java 8 from Oracle instead of Java 10 from Openjdk
Using maven surefire 2.21.0 I solved the issue changing the reuseForks option value from true to false:
VM crash or System.exit called),but When i gave folder name as test_demo then it solved this issue.
Finally managed to solve as follows:
EARLIER: (when the issue was happening):
           javac is from jdk 1.8
           java was pointing to the java bin from jdk 1.11
CURRENT: (when the issue got resolved):
           both javac & java are pointing to the bins from jdk 1.8
I updated the surefire plugin to the following and this solved my problem:
It was solved by adding the following configuration parameter to maven-surefire-plugin in pom.xml (under pluginManagement):
note: the definition of F is modified, the problem is now Solve h for F(h) = TR
The reason why nsolve is not useful is because the graph is almost asymptotically vertical.
I don't think nsolve is useful for such steep graphs.
This is a pretty wild function and I suspect nsolve uses an epsilon that is to large to be useful in this situation.
It is difficult to tell you how to deal with the output of solveset in general because every type of set needs to be dealt with in different ways.
solve and solveset need to be used "interactively" because there are lots of possible outputs with lots of ways to understand it.
That is one reason why substituting values into the solution from solve does not necessarily give exactly the same value that you get from substituting before calling solve.
Also before you substitute the symbols it isn't possible for solve to know which of the three roots is real.
That's why you get three solutions from solve(expr, r) and only one solution from solve(expr.subs(vdict), r).
The third solution which is real after the substitution is the same (ignoring the tiny imaginary part) as returned by solve after the substitution:
Because the polynomial is ill-conditioned and has a large gradient at the root nsolve has a hard time finding this root.
However nsolve can find the root if given a narrow enough interval:
Solve is not supposed to solve inequalities (M7).
Here is an example with Solve:
What problems does it solve?
It solved the problem of conveniently checking if an object derives from a certain prototype.
How do I solve this with respect to null?
How do I solve this with respect to null?
Solve will give you both (and even some solutions with Complex numbers).
Here is the version with Solve/NSolve
If you use Solve instead of NSolve you will have a (large) closed form of each component of each solution.
If you need more digits for the solution, add at the end of the NSolve command the option WorkingPrecision->30 (or any other number of digits.
The problem with that algebraic equation is that involves square roots,or radicals and normal polynomial, and that that type of equation is not easy to solve, take a look at this equation:

There is an excellent library pypoman which solves the vertex enumerate problem and can help with your problem, but unfortunately it only outputs the vertices of the set, not the visualization.
It solves the system A x >= b and outputs ordered vertices and visualizes the set.
See [Matrix#lup (hyper-link)] and [Matrix::LUPDecomposition#solve (hyper-link)], which solve the linear system using LU decomposition.
If you want to look for analytic solutions ( which is what Solve does ),
assume the step function has a value 0 or 1 , use Solve and check the step function assumption against the results:
In your case (I called the file solve.pl):
This is how I resolved it.
To solve this, a minimal fix is to simply exclude the case in which X[i][j] and X[k][h] refer to the same cell:
LinearSolve(M);
Hope this solves your problem.
I could solve this issue by doing "ant clean debug".
Importing using "Import -> Exising Projects into Workspace" solved it.
It will solve the problem.
Anyway, here is an example of how you make use of the symbolic solver solve:
See also [the language docs for solve (hyper-link)].
I am much late to the party but today I faced the same error and how I resolved was simple.
I solved the problem by checking what where the values that where updating.
It took me few hours to solved this because all off the settings that I found here about this error were the same but it still didn't work.
Below step solved my issue:
The Python package [sympy (hyper-link)] can be used for symbolic integration of [ordinary differential equations (hyper-link)], as follows (using the function [sympy.dsolve (hyper-link)]):
For this example, the function sympy.solvers.ode.ode.dsolve raises the exception [PolynomialDivisionFailed (hyper-link)].
An alternative is to numerically solve the differential equation (for specific initial condition), and compute solutions for a range of initial conditions, to explore how the solution depends on the initial condition.
For new code, use [scipy.integrate.solve_ivp (hyper-link)] to solve a differential equation.
The function [scipy.integrate.solve_ivp (hyper-link)] can be used as follows:
Please note the differences in arguments between the function scipy.integrate.odeint and the function scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.
Or you can also surround with a try/catch if you consider it's needed, but the best way to solve it it's to verify your objects before they are used.
HTTP/2 solves this by introducing multiplexing so that you can issue new requests over the same connection without having to wait for the previous ones to complete.
All this together solves HOLB - or more accurately prevents it even being an issue.
The one point that should be noted is that while this solves HTTP HOLB, it's still built on TCP and it has its own TCP HOLB issue which may be worse under HTTP/2 as it's a single connection!
Google is experimenting with using HTTP/2 over non-guaranteed UDP rather than guaranteed TCP in a protocol called QUIC to resolve this issue and this is in the process of being set as a web standard too (just like SPDY - initially a Google implementation - was standardised to HTTP/2).
Did you mean to solve this:
When solving the equations with symbolic x and y, the solver will find a solution with a certain condition, which can be obtained using the argument 'ReturnCondition':
As you can see, y = 0 does not fulfill this general solution given by the solver, resulting in your problem for y = 0.
That solved my issue.
I resolved to using the MySQL console source command, and of course you don't have to worry about phpMyAdmin or PHP maximum execution time and limits.
None of the above answers solved it for me.
Avoid solve, and use \ instead.
Using solve,
I re-install it on a larger partition and it solve my problem.
I had a same problem and I solved by deleting some unwanted files from my disk.
Potentially there is a Lambert form for this but solve does not find anything.
You can solve it numerically though using nsolve:
This type of problem can be solved by [Z3py (hyper-link)], a [SAT/SMT (hyper-link)] solver:
Try using the ReturnConditions flag of the solve command.
If we start from zero assumptions, solve will find a set of solutions for the given equations.
The above uses [linsolve (hyper-link)] because the system is linear in each of the unknowns.
Other [solvers (hyper-link)] are available for nonlinear equations.
which means it is either La_solve or La_solve_cmplx.
[here (hyper-link)] one could find out that
La_solve will call LAPACK routine [DGESV (hyper-link)], and La_solve_cmplx will call LAPACK routine ZGESV.
I hope this would solve the issue.
To solve it numerically, you need scipy rather than sympy.
Solve an ordinary or generalized eigenvalue problem of a square matrix.
For real symmetric or complex Hermitian dense matrices, you can use [scipy.linalg.eigh() (hyper-link)] to solve a generalized eigenvalue problem.
The program Mathematica provides actually very simple solution inside the function Solve[].
I believe the problem is that solve is meant to solve algebraic equations and your equation has the unknown as an exponent.
Given the equation 2^x=3 solve will correctly give [x=log(3)/log(2)].
A workaround is to solve your equation symbolically and then substitute values after.
You can't solve this puzzle greedily: always taking the branch with lower heuristic value will not lead you to the final solution every time.
If the equations require integer solutions, you should search for Diophantine equation solvers for Python.
Just note that using a simple solver for Project Euler is missing the point.
The fun, and educational part, is learning how to solve it yourself using primitive methods!
Nonlinear problems tend to be solved on a case by case basis.
If you don't really need symbolic algrebra, but you need a way to program with matrices, solve differential equations, and minimize functions, then scipy or octave are excelent starting points.
Here is how to solve your original question using Python (via Sage).
euler_solve():= block
    (
    [ a, b, A, B, end:1000],
Then you just enter the function name: euler_solve(), hit return, wait a few seconds, and out pops the answer.
Once the script is loaded into a Python code, it gives the ability to solve problems of:
The optimization problem is solved with the following Python script:
In python, using [sympy's solver module (hyper-link)] (note that it assumes all equations are set equal to zero):
I figured out that my problem is not "solving" or "solve" instead it is "root-finding".
To solve this warning, the line
You cannot use numpy.linalg.solve for non-square matrices as mentioned in the [documentation (hyper-link)], a must be square and of full-rank, i.e., all rows (or, equivalently, columns) must be linearly independent.
As is, solve and solveset (an alternative SymPy solver) give up on the equation because of this mix of trigonometric functions of different arguments.
It can be handled with solveset(eq5, x).
By default solveset  gives all complex solutions and we need only real roots among them, so let's specify the domain as Reals:
Unlike a purely numeric solution we'd get from SciPy or other numeric solvers, these can be evaluated with any accuracy without repeating the process.
There could be a program written in prolog that can solve this puzzle in a very roundabout way, but this puzzle is more specific than a general case.
The way to solve this is to work bottom-up, generating each Fibonnaci term one-by-one, and adding it to the sum if it's even, and stopping once we reach the 4 million threshold.
My understanding of "the spirit of lisp" is to detach yourself from any fixed, dogmatic, stuckup idea of the spirit of lisp, and use the lisp construct that most closely reflects the structure of computation required to solve your problem.
If you do the latter you can just say (solve 1) to get the result.
Now the kicker: since we have to compute fib for sequential values until some condition is met, we start the solver at fib 1.
The documentation should be fixed to say that it is fine to use solve if you want.
You can't use solveset to solve a system of equation as it is for solving single univariate equations only.
The newer solvers for systems of equations are linsolve and nonlinsolve.
Either of those will work for this system but there is also nothing wrong with using solve:
Regarding parallelized linear solvers, you can replace R's BLAS / LAPACK library with one that supports multithreaded computations, such as ATLAS, Goto BLAS, Intel's MKL, or AMD's ACML.
You've not mentioned the amount of RAM available (or the distribution of it per core or machine), but A sparse solver should be pretty smart about managing RAM accesses and not try to chew on too much data at once.
If you are planning to do research on such systems for the long-term, you should look at other solvers that may be more applicable to your type of data and computing infrastructure.
[Here is a very nice directory (hyper-link)] of the options for both solvers and pre-conditioners.
It seems this doesn't include [IBM's "Watson" solver suite (hyper-link)].
For me, it's not quite as fast as using the solve methods of the splu function output, but it seems to get reasonably close (and avoids calling splu).
I decided to explore a solver that uses a greedy entropic approach.
But there are still many questions that are not easily answered with an interactive solver.
It turns out that this solver will always complete in 5 steps or fewer.
However, since creating this solver and playing around with it, I have greatly improved my technique, and 5 steps is indeed an achievable goal even when you don't have time to calculate the entropically ideal guess at each step ;)
How likely is it that the solver will take 5 steps?
However, because of the large runtime growth rate of this problem, I was not able to solve the 8-colour, 5-hole Mastermind problem, even with this optimization.
I once wrote a "[Jotto (hyper-link)]" solver which is essentially "Master Mind" with words.
This always solve standard case in 5 attempts, but it is not a full proof that 5 attempts are really needed because it could happen that for next step a bigger set possibilities would have given a better result than a smaller one (because easier to distinguish between).
Here's a link to pure Python solver for Mastermind(tm):  [http://code.activestate.com/recipes/496907-mastermind-style-code-breaking/ (hyper-link)]  It has a simple version, a way to experiment with various guessing strategies, performance measurement, and an optional C accelerator.
Here's the full code to solve that variant:
[Here (hyper-link)] is the documentation for the whole module, and [here (hyper-link)] is the documentation for spsolve.
You won't be able to solve that exact problem much faster than with numpy.linalg.solve.
If m is small as you suggest and if B is invertible, you can instead solve the equation U.T=Ba in a minute or less.
Depending on whether you need the original data anymore and if the matrices involved have any other special properties, you might be able to fiddle with the parameters in scipy.linalg.solve instead for a gain.
Finally we can just solve the full set of equations
If speed is important and you know that the things that are given will not change, it is faster and simpler only to solve the very last equation:
Lastly, if you pre-solve the equations, you then get an expression which you can substitute into later:
Solve is usually better at polynomial problems and not as good at transcendental problems.
As pointed out in the comments, you can't solve an expression.
What you can do sometimes is this: introduce a new variable to represent the value of your expression, solve the resulting equation for one of the original variables (perhaps manually), then substitute it into the condition.
Solve the equation a + b == x for either a or b, giving a = x - b or b = x - a
Nowadays, the Neos server only supports a small number of solvers through Pyomo.
You cannot use DICOPT solver in Pyomo, not supported.
Octave itself doesn't contain a CAS system (but you can solve ODEs, see help lsode).
Here is an excerpt from the [full solution (hyper-link)] using [NSolver (hyper-link)], posted at [Einstein’s Riddle in C# (hyper-link)]:
Someone can probably solve it in one line with something like haskell :)
[In PAIP (Chapter 11), Norvig solves the zebra puzzle using a Prolog embedded in Lisp (hyper-link)].

The Microsoft Solver Foundation example from:

The easiest way to solve such problems programmatically is to use nested loops over all permutations and check to see if the result satisfies the predicates in the question.
[ Note: Because a using-declaration designates a base class member
  (and not a member subobject or a member function of a base class
  subobject), a using-declaration cannot be used to resolve inherited
  member ambiguities.
Cool - today I learned about Python's numerical solver.
If you cannot predict range of b values, you can use a solver instead.
Edit Since what you need is a triangular solve procedure, also called backward/forward substitution, you can use ordinary MATLAB backslash \ operator for that:
To be sure of that, you can compare the performance to cs_usolve procedure found in [SuiteSparse (hyper-link)].
It is a mex function implemented in C that computes sparse triangular solve for upper-triangular sparse matrix (there are similar functions there too: cs_lsolve, cs_utsolve and cs_ltsolve).
You can have a look at a [performance comparison (hyper-link)] of native MATLAB and cs_l(t)solve in the context of sparse Cholesky factorization.
The only pitfall is if you want to solve a transposed system
In that case you should call cs_utsolve explicitly.
UT and LT systems are amongst the easiest systems to solve.
Knowing this, it is easy to write your own UT or LT solver:
Note that this operator also solves UT systems which have non-square A or if A has some elements equal to zero (or < eps) on the main diagonal.
It solves these cases in a least-squares sense, which may or may not be desirable for you.
You could check for these cases before carrying out the solve:
When trying to solve this with SymPy you get a pretty clear error message: NotImplementedError: only univariate inequalities are supported.
Be aware that this means that the SymPy team will be very happy if you contribute an algorithm that solves this problem.
Now that it is clear that sympy.solve is not powerful enough you can try another approach.
Regretfully it is only a numeric solution, not a symbolic one that you can get from solve but it might be enough:
There is a multivariate inequality solver in mystic, which is built on top of sympy.
mystic won't actually solve the inequalities per se, but it will (usually) generate a valid solution to the inequalities.
Use the Solve or Reduce functions.
Solve[{LIST OF EQUATIONS}, {Variables to solve for}]
then to solve for total = 100 you write (note the lack of apostrophes)
It may be better to use fsolve, with
Here is an example where explained [fsolve (hyper-link)] a little bit more.
correction is to add the flag=DECOMP_QR as the 4th, optional, arguement to the call to solve()
I don't think DotNumerics can solve LP problems by itself.
As far as I interpret the documentation, the [Nelder–Mead (hyper-link)] (downhill simplex method) implemented is only used to solve simple minimalisation problems, not LP problems.
The last time I've solved LP in c#, I used a .net wrapper to [LP_Solve (hyper-link)].
If you download the lpsolve package, it should come with an example for .net.
You can also plug it into the [microsoft solver foundation (hyper-link)] ([see here (hyper-link)]), but I think MSF has some licensing issues and you can't use it freely for commercial applications.
Again, you can simply use lpsolve without MSF.
Lpsolve is a pretty good LP solver unless you have massive size problems.
You need to restructure your solve method to look something like this:
[Equations and systems solver in MATLAB (hyper-link)].
First of all, Selenium can not solve the captchas.
You need to make your execution wait until you solve the captcha manually.
For example, a captcha should have one checkbox, and after you solved the captcha it should automatically be checked.
(I'm too lazy to do that right now; b(t) can be solved immediately (an "affine" equation), a(t) can be solved by integration.)
git pull (or rather, the git merge part that pull does) will "solve" both 'ahead' and 'behind'.
Message-passing OO does not, in general, solve the namespacing problem that you talk about.
This completely solves namespace problem, you can also have a non-centralized type-based dispatch (OOP) if you want to.
If you want to solve that directly, you can derive a linear system.
Solve for the s.. and you're done.
Otherwise, you might want to solve for a least-squares solution.
This solves the equation recursively 100 times.You can do a convergence test that is Si-Si-1=some small value to check for convergence too.
Can Math.NET solve any matrix?
Specifically, it can't solve a system of equations that has no solution, and nor can any other solver.
Remember that all you're doing when you're trying to solve Ax=b is to solve a set of simultaneous equations.
No it cannot solve singular matrices.
Sometimes when doing finite element analysis, if you don't remove the appropriate rows and columns from your stiffness matrix and load matrix according to these boundary conditions, you will end up with a system that cannot be solved, which is the case here.
Try the DirectSolver again with:
I should also point out that the reason I suggest using the Direct Solver Example is because it seems like you are looking for an exact solution.
The Iterative Solvers save computation time by merely approximating a solution.
Check out SymPy, specifically the [solver (hyper-link)].
For symbolic solutions (which is to say to get y = x**2 -> x = +/- sqrt(y)) [SymPy (hyper-link)] [solver (hyper-link)] gives you roughly what you need.
Here is an example using the Python interpreter to solve the equation that is mentioned in the question.
The fzero function can solve all sorts of nonlinear equations.
To solve it, I loaded the exact same image using Glide into the same imageview and it worked!
I solved the intersection of 3 spheres given those 3 equations using this method.
If you're trying to solve for the intersection of the cubic and the circle, i.e., where y==poly2sym(a) equals (x-xi)^2+(y-yi)^2==length_OnePart^2 it looks like solve may be confused about something when the circle is represented parametrically rather than as single valued functions.
It also could depend on the use of a numeric solver in this case.
solve seems to work fine with similar inputs to yours, so you might [report this behavior to the MathWorks (hyper-link)] to see what they think.
In fact, solve might be able to find one or more solutions exactly, if you provide exact representations.
So your problem is, your solve predicate doesn't find any solutions.
You can rephrase your equation by defining like below f(y) and then find the root of it with fsolve
To solve the problem I returned the version of Gradle:
I solved this by changing my mobile setting.
In this case the nonlinear solvers miss the opportunity to simplify sin(q3)/cos(q3) to tan(q3), thus reducing the number of appearances of q3 to one.
If they are pushed to follow a particular strategy - e.g., "solve for v1 from the first, sub into the second, simplify and solve for q3" - the solution comes out without much fuss.
I tried some values and it seems solve returns a numeric solution.
In this case, you may directly call the numeric solver with a matching start value
and solve
bitxor(2,x) wil either add 2 or subtract 2 to/from x, so you have to solve both:
It solved the issue for me.
You need to know how to solve non-linear equations.
You can use Matlab's symbolic solver if you have the Symbolic toolbox...
Jeffrey Snover (PowerShell inventor) [elaborates a little (hyper-link)] on how PowerShell was created with which goals and problems it should solve.
is that that sym_eqn is now an expression that contains a Symbol that does not have the attribute real set to True which is required to run solve on it.
You have 3 options to solve it
Instead, use syms to declare variables and replace inputs such as
  solve('2*x == 1','x') with solve(2*x == 1,x).
Renaming .c to .cpp solved my problem.
In my case, set the cpp file to "C/C++ compiler" in "property"->"general", resolve the LNK2019 error.
You seem to be using V1 as a placeholder in Solve to get VL and VR.
That's pretty close to what we want, but it's not quite solved for Av, so let's do that too:
Then solve is implicitly assuming that x**2 - 1 is equal to 0.
If you wanted to solve x**2 - 1 = 2, then you could either subtract 2 from both sides, to get
The output of [solve (hyper-link)] is a list, as often there are multiple solutions.
solve(Eq(x**3 - 6*x**2 + 11*x, 6)) would be the list [1, 2, 3].
So in my opinion you have the same issue when one of the sites raising your traffic and you start get this error - you as you said restarting apache - and that solves this permanently.
As far as algorithms go you can check out Introduction to the Design and Analysis of Algorithms by Anany Levitin, I know he has a nice algorithm to solve by Gaussian Elimination with cubic (n^3) runtime, but I don't remember it offhand.
To solve a System of linear equations, there are many different techniques available.
are examples for different techniques used to solve system of linear equations.
You solve it like any other exception as well:
To solve:
this is your algorithm issue, you are adding 0.1 to your variable every step, and it means all numbers are equal in the end you must create two mathematical equations and two unknown values and then solve them.
this is the main approach to solve such problems.
you can solve this equation by [this (hyper-link)] (Matrix manipulation) or [this (hyper-link)] (substitution one unknown with another) on method.
I changed the name to resolve this inconsistency.
If I've correctly understood what you're asking, you can use Sympy's linsolve function to solve the equations symbolically first, then substitute in numbers afterwards.
The key step is to tell linsolve which variables you want to solve for.
and pass them and the chosen variables to linsolve
But the good news is that either equation can be solved symbolically for c**(1/h),  since it is quadratic in that expression, so you can then substitute values for x and h into the solutions after you compute them.
You can solve this most easily with Matlab's backslash operator:
