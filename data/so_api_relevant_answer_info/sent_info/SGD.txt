tf.train.MomentumOptimizer = SGD + momentum
[tf.keras.optimizers.SGD (hyper-link)] has a momentum parameter.
SGD is one of many optimization methods, namely first order optimizer, meaning, that it is based on analysis of the gradient of the objective.
You could also apply SGD to gradients obtained in a different way (from sampling, numerical approximators etc.).
This common misconception comes from the fact, that for simplicity people sometimes say "trained with backprop", what actually means (if they do not specify optimizer) "trained with SGD using backprop as a gradient computing technique".
optimization level - where techniques like SGD, Adam, Rprop, BFGS etc.
Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is an optimization method used e.g.
In the SGD, you use 1 example, at each iteration, to update the weights of your model, depending on the error due to this example, instead of using the average of the errors of all examples (as in "simple" gradient descent), at each iteration.
To do so, SGD needs to compute the "gradient of your model".
Backpropagation is an efficient technique to compute this "gradient" that SGD uses.
Back-propagation is just a method for calculating multi-variable derivatives of your model, whereas SGD is the method of locating the minimum of your loss/cost function.
SGD Classifier is a model that is optimized (trained) using SGD (taking the gradient of the loss of each sample at a time and the model is updated along the way) in classification problems.
SGD Regressor is a model that is optimized (trained) using SGD  for regression tasks.
SGD {Stochastic Gradient Descent} is an optimization method, which is used by machine learning algorithms or models to optimize the loss function.
In the scikit-learn library, these model SGDClassifier and SGDRegressor, which might confuse you to think that SGD is a classifier and regressor.
SGDClassifier - it is a [classifier (hyper-link)] optimized by SGD
SGDRegressor - it is a [regressor (hyper-link)] optimized by SGD.
Stochastic gradient descent{SGD} does not support batch, it takes single training example at a time unlike {batch} Gradient descent.
By now, you may have started getting the point: under the hood, plot_precision_recall_curve checks if either a predict_proba() or a decision_function() method is available for the classifier used; and if a predict_proba() is not available, like your case here of an SGDClassifier with hinge loss (or the [documentation example (hyper-link)] of a LinearSVC classifier with squared hinge loss), it reverts to the decision_function() method instead, in order to calculate the y_pred which will be subsequently used for plotting the PR (and ROC) curve.
In version v0.10.0 of Flux, Flux has deprecated usage of SGD in favor of Descent which is just a more optimised version of the Standard Gradient Descent algorithm.
SGD is a [PayPal supported currency (hyper-link)], and your code's usage appears correct according to the documentation for that unofficial react-paypal-button-v2 component, so I'm not sure what's going wrong here.
1-bit sgd is an effective strategy when the communication time between GPUs is large compared to the computation time for a minibatch.
This is equivalent to weight decay for standard SGD (but not for adaptive gradient optimizers) according to [Decoupled Weight Decay Regularization (hyper-link)] paper by Loshchilov & Hutter.
See
[https://www.tensorflow.org/addons/api_docs/python/tfa/optimizers/SGDW (hyper-link)]
1-bit SGD itself has computation cost (for quantization) that you should be aware of.
SGDRegressor in sklearn is numerically not stable for not scaled input parameters.
after training the SGD regressor, you will have to scale the test input variable accordingly.
It is necessary to make same random.choice for x1 and y1 in SGD.
After such change, both SGD and BGD will yield similar results:
Adam works most of the times, so avoid using SGD as long as you don't have a specific reason.
SGD algorithm?
It is implemented as expected on Wikipedia in the [SGD (hyper-link)] class with the basic extensions such as momentum.
You can use the pickle library to save and load your SGDClassifer as well as your DictVectorizer likes this:
build_federated_sgd_process is fully-canned; it is really designed to serve as a reference implementation, not as a point of extensibility.
I believe what you are looking for is the function that build_federated_sgd_process calls under the hoos, [tff.learning.framework.build_model_delta_optimizer_process (hyper-link)].
as more or less in the body of [build_federated_sgd_process (hyper-link)].
SGD is an [Stochastic Gradient Descent (hyper-link)]-based (this is a general optimization method!)
sklearn says: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a simple yet very efficient approach to discriminative learning of linear classifiers under convex loss functions.
Now SGD-based optimization is very different from QP and others.
SGD-based optimizers (or general first-order methods) are very very hard to tune!
SGD-based methods

scale better for huge-data in general
need hyper-parameter tuning
solve only a subset of the tasks approachable by the the above (no kernel-methods!)
You will see non-optimal (objective / loss) results in the SGD-case quite easily!
SGDClassifier uses gradient descent optimisation technique, where, the optimum coefficients are identified by iteration process.
SGDClassifier can perform only linear classification
SGDClassifer can use Linear SVC(SVM) model when the parameter loss is set to 'hinge'(which is the default) i.e SGDClassifier(loss='hinge')
CNTK's documentation about SGD: [https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/wiki/SGD-Block (hyper-link)]
Using linear_model.SGDRegressor:
The SGD optimizer in PyTorch is just gradient descent.
In my resource, the formula for SGD with momentum is:
What I was doing wrong was I was assuming that I was doing that calculation in my calcema() function and then I just took the value calculated in calcema() and plugged it into a normal SGD formula.
Logistic Regression in Sklearn doesn't have a 'sgd' solver though.
SGDClassifier is a generalized linear classifier that will use Stochastic Gradient Descent as a solver.
As it is mentionned here [http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/sgd.html (hyper-link)] : "Even though SGD has been around in the machine learning community for a long time, it has received a considerable amount of attention just recently in the context of large-scale learning."
With SGDClassifier you can use lots of different loss functions (a function to minimize or maximize to find the optimum solution) that allows you to "tune" your model and find the best sgd based linear model for your data.
In your example, the SGD classifier will have the same loss function as the Logistic Regression but a different solver.
can use the sgd: Stochastic Gradient Descent
Basically, SGD is like an umbrella capable to facing different linear functions.
SGD is an approximation algorithm like taking single single points and as the number of point increases it converses more to the optimal solution.
Logistic Regression uses Gradient descent by default so its slower (if compared on large dataset)
To make SGD perform well for any particular linear function, lets say here logistic Regression we tune the parameters called hyperparameter tuning
While Adam has an adaptive step size, SGD doesn't.
This means that SGD may start bouncing in the ravine when the step size is too big.
If you try reducing the step size in SGD you will probably get better results, however, the number of required iterations will increase.
Maybe start with a single-layer network with one or 2 units to test out (sigmoid, SGD) first and then gradually increase the network complexity.
It is best to understand why SGD works first.
The Stochastic part of the SGD comes into play here.
On the average, SGD will follow the actual gradient's path (but it can get stuck at a different local minima, all depends on the selection of the learning rate).
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) keeps no batches in memory, except the one it is working on.
An SGD classifier was trained incrementally with three classes in the first 100 batches.
So, yes, SGD indeed seems to suffer from [catastrophic forgetting (hyper-link)].
So the three types you mentioned are all SGD.
Even if you use all your data to perform an SGD iteration, it's still a stochastic estimate of the actual gradient; as upon collecting new data (your dataset doesn't include all the data in universe) your estimate will change, hence stochastic.
Looking at [the source code (hyper-link)] confirms that the meaning of --algorithm sgd here simply leaves the default alone.
This is different than vw --sgd.
It doesn't disable the defaults by passing --sgd to vw.
Also: you can verify this further by looking at the log file created by vw-hyperopt in the current dir and verify it has no --sgd option in it.
sgd: An optimizer, i.e.
The drop, sgd and size are some of the parameters you can customize to optimize your training.
sgd is used to change various hyperparameters such as learning rate, Adam beta1 and beta2 parameters, gradient clipping and L2 regularisation.
I consider the sgd to be a very important argument to experiment with.
TensorFlow's jargon for the algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is optimizer.
[http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html#sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.partial_fit (hyper-link)]
Solver type should by "SGD" by default, but there are two ways to define it: one is using [solver_type: SGD (hyper-link)], and the other is using [type: "SGD" (hyper-link)].
I solved the problem by including "caffe/solvers/sgd_solver.cpp" into "caffe.cpp".
A drawback of SGD-based optimizers is that they rely upon scalar and uniform learning of gradients in all the directions (i.e., for all the parameters for which gradient is to be updated).
As mentioned in [Improving Generalization Performance by Switching from Adam to SGD (hyper-link)]:
Despite superior training outcomes, adaptive optimization methods such
  as Adam, Adagrad or RMSprop have been found to generalize poorly
  compared to Stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
These methods tend to
  perform well in the initial portion of training but are outperformed
  by SGD at later stages of training.
In order to combine the best of both the optimizers, they introduce a switching technique from Adam to SGD by taking care of: (a) the switchover point, i.e.
how long to train the model with Adam before switching to SGD.
(b) the learning rate to be used for SGD after the switch: determined by the momentum parameter beta_1 of Adam.
SGD performs in general poorly and it is barely used anymore.
You have to keep in mind, that you are using a SGD which is a Stochastic Gradient Descent.
A visualization of the difference in the trajectories one gets by using SGD compared to vanilla GD can be seen in the following image:
[ (hyper-link)] ([source (hyper-link)])
You can see, that the SGD trajectory is not perpendicular to the level lines, but moves differently.
If something is used during the forward pass (prediction), then it also gets updated during the backward pass (SGD).
I believe that in your example SGD will eventually yield estimate for b close to 5, but it will take way more than 20 epochs (1-2 thousands?).
The naming libCGAL-vc120-mt-sgd-4.5.1.lib shows that you are compiling a program, that uses CGAL, using the linker flag /MTd (Debug, and link the C++ runtime statically).
SGDs like that need to be terminated with a \r\n.
Before calibrating your model, just .fit the SGDClassifier.
You'd need to have runtime-link=static runtime-debugging=on variant=debug in the b2 command line args to get sgd.
The snippet in the documentation of LearningRateScheduler gives an example of how to implement exponential learning rate decay like in SGD:
Both conditions are required not only in SGD, but in many other stochastic approximation methods.
The reason is you are using tensorflow.python.keras API for model and layers and keras.optimizers for SGD.
sgd = optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01)
model.compile(loss='mean_squared_error', optimizer=sgd)
My contribution to the question is in regards your initial intention on implementing the SGD with Warm Restarts in R Keras.
because, as clearly mentioned in the SGDClassifier [documentation (hyper-link)], your dependent variable y should have a single column:
[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html#sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.partial_fit (hyper-link)]
While it is getting printed your second SGD is processed.
This a known limitation of the current implementation of scikit-learn's SGD classifier, there is currently no automated convergence check on that model.
You are setting the learning rate of SGD as the callback, that is incorrect, you should set an initial learning rate to SGD:
It seems like you set alpha in SGDClassifier to learning rate.
To set constant learning rate set SGDClassifier's learing_rate to constant and eta0 to your learning rate.
The difference from "classical" SGD to a mini-batch gradient descent is that you use multiple samples (a so-called mini-batch) to calculate the update for w. This has the advantage, that the steps you take in direction of the solution are less noisy, as you follow a smoothed gradient.
Please let me know if u find another solution for calculating M based on SGD.
The reason for your error is that the SGDClassifier which you are using does not have a feature_count_ attribute (check the available attributes in the [docs (hyper-link)]):
Initially I thought that the problem was in that you were using a GridSearchCV object, but this is not the case, since the line class_labels = classifier.classes_ inside your function does not raise any error; and although from the docs it seems that SGDClassifier does not even have a classes_ attribute, in practice it turns out it indeed has:
iif(Currency = "SGD", Amount, 0) 
iif(Currency = "USD", Amount, 0)
One way to achieve this is to add a new disconnected table Currencies with one column Currency and values AUD, SGD and HKD.
[SWITCH (hyper-link)] will compare this value with a list of possible options (AUD, SGD and HKD) and return corresponding expression (SUMX('Table'; [AUD]), SUMX('Table'; [SGD]) or SUMX('Table'; [HKD])), or some default value if there is no match (SUMX('Table'; [AUD])).
sgd: Each letter indicates something


s: Static linking
g: Linked to debug libraries
y: "using a special debug build of Python"
d: Boost debug
p: Uses "the STLPort standard library"
n: using STLPort's deprecated "native iostreams" feature
It sets $/ to the empty string to enable paragraph input mode, and prints each paragraph unless it contains sgd or current_line abc
Here is my understanding: the modern, sophisticated gradient descent algorithms like ADAM use more computational power than SGD.
Another place that SGD is used is as a substitute for solving very large linear regressions by ordinary least-squares.
In that case, SGD is the more practical way to solve the problem.
The regex could be something like: \bSGD\s+(\d+(?:\.\d+)?
Note: it would have been helpful to find this information on the [sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier page (hyper-link)].
I think the short answer might be that SGD doesn't work so well with only a few samples, but is (much more) performant with larger data.
First remark: you are using SGDClassifier with the default parameters: they are likely not the optimal values for this dataset: try other values as well (especially for alpha, the regularization parameter).
10000 samples) and then passing the whole transformed training set to a linear model such as SGDClassifier: it requires 2 passes over the dataset.
Edit: the fluctuation of the estimate of the SGDClassifier score is expected: SGD stands for stochastic gradient descent, which means that examples are considered one at a time: badly classified samples can cause an update of the weights of the model in a way that is detrimental for other samples, you need to do more than one pass over the data to make the learning rate decrease enough to get a smoother estimate of the validation accuracy.
I had to multiply the return value by "-1" as I'm using stochastic gradient decedent (sgd) as optimiser and not stochastic gradient ascent!
Had an old version of libboost_iostreams-vc100-mt-sgd-1_51.lib that was compiled without the bzip.
"Adam" is a special case of "SGD" solver: Using minibatches, each iteration gives a stochastic estimate of the local gradient.
Had you used plain "SGD" solver your 'caffemodel' and 'solverstate' would have the same file size.
Wikipedia for instance says USD, SGD and AUD sometimes is abbreviated with US$, S$ and A$, respectively.
You can't say it is not SGD.
Which means if you use only a mini-batch (ideally one single instance, but mini-batch is also fine) of data for a single epoch, We call it SGD.
While it is true that in its most pristine form SGD operates on just 1 sample point, in reality this is not the dominant practice.
The learning rate for SGD is generally quite small say 1e-3.
So even if a sample point happens to be an outlier, the wrong gradients will be scaled by 1e-3 and hence SGD will not be too much off the correct trajectory.
So altogether using a medium-sized mini-batch and using a small learning rate helps SGD to not digress a lot from the correct trajectory.
Now the word stochastic in SGD can also imply various other measures.
Now, this is just one trick amongst dozens of other techniques and if you are interested can read source code of popular implementation of SGD in [PyTorch (hyper-link)] or TensorFlow.
Compare the params accepted by [SGDOptimizer (hyper-link)] with those accepted by [AdamOptimizer (hyper-link)].
Use SGD as base currency and USD as Default Display Currency on store.
I tend to use vanilla sgd as long as I am still in the process of getting the general graph-layout right as ADAM and AdaGrad bring a lot of matrices-overhead with them,, making debugging really harder.
You can see it in Google Chrome for example by access [view-source:http://server1-xeon.asuscomm.com/currency/?amount=1.20,from=MYR,to=SGD (hyper-link)].
So, actually you can make such request in PHP to avoid access dynamic content on the http://server1-xeon.asuscomm.com/currency/?amount=1.20,from=MYR,to=SGD page.
By the time the page on [http://server1-xeon.asuscomm.com/currency/?amount=1.20,from=MYR,to=SGD (hyper-link)] is loaded, a JavaScript code on this page (it means that it's executed on the client side, in a browser, not on your server) parses URL parameters and makes AJAX POST request to the URL [http://server1-xeon.asuscomm.com/currency/WebService.asmx/YaHOO_CurrencyEx (hyper-link)].
It passes a JSON payload {amount:1.20,fromCurrency:'MYR',toCurrency:'SGD'} and gets a response like this {"d":0.390360}.
with SGD.
You can use the step parameter from [LinearRegressionWithSGD (hyper-link)] to define your step size but that will not allow your code to work because you are mixing incompatible libraries.
Unfortunately, I do not know how to do cross validation with the ml library using SGD optimization and I would like to know myself but you are mixing the libraries [pyspark.ml (hyper-link)] and [pyspark.mllib (hyper-link)].
Specifically you cannot use [LinearRegressionWithSGD (hyper-link)] with the pyspark.ml library.
Therefore, you can probably set the parameters of the 'gd' optimizer run as SGD, but I am not sure where the solver documentation is or how to set the solver attributes (e.g.
If anyone knows how to set the solver attributes, that could answer your question by allowing you to use the Pipeline, ParamGridBuilder, and CrossValidation ml packages for model selection with LinearRegression utilizing SGD optimization for parameter tuning.
You are getting an error because you are using keras ExponentialDecay inside tensorflow add-on optimizer SGDW.
SGD is not supported for Direct Credit Card Payments.
You are using the default learning rate of sgd (which is 0.01, maybe too high).
Adam optimizer is much more powerful comparing to SGD.
Adam implicitly performs coordinate-wise gradient clipping and can hence, unlike SGD, tackle heavy-tailed noise.
Now, just feed it through your SGD optimizer instead.
: Accurate, Large Minibatch SGD: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour [https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02677 (hyper-link)]
They show that this ratio plays a major role in the width of the minima found by SGD.
But if you want my practical advice, stick with SGD and just go proportional to the increase in batch size if your batch size is small and then don't increase it beyond a certain point.
I'm trying to do the same thing, was wondering why it oscillates completely out of control using the SGD optimizer and meanSquareError for the loss function, so to debug it I lowered the learning rate to something suuuuper small and guess what?
SGDClassifier have a partial_fit method, and one of the primary objectives of partial_fit method is to scale sklearn models to large-scale datasets.
Using this, you can load a part of the dataset into RAM, feed it to SGD, and keep repeating this unless full dataset is used.
This will allows you to use momentum variation of SGD such as adam.
[SGD (hyper-link)] is indeed a technique that is used to find the minima of a function.
SGDClassifier is a linear classifier (by default in sklearn it is a linear SVM) that uses SGD for training (that is, looking for the minima of the loss using SGD).
SGDClassifier is a Linear classifiers (SVM, logistic regression, a.o.)
with SGD training.
This estimator implements regularized linear models with stochastic
  gradient descent (SGD) learning: the gradient of the loss is estimated
  each sample at a time and the model is updated along the way with a
  decreasing strength schedule (aka learning rate).
SGD allows minibatch
  (online/out-of-core) learning, see the partial_fit method.
Taken from SGD sikit-learn documentation
[SGDClassifier (hyper-link)] is a linear classifier which implements regularized linear models with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) learning
Stochastic Gradient Descent ([sgd (hyper-link)]) is a solver.
Other alternative solvers for sgd in [neural_network.MLPClassifier (hyper-link)] are lbfgs and adam
‘sgd’ refers to stochastic gradient descent.

When you convert $21.73 SGD Singapore Dollars to US Dollars, it approximates $16 USD
For the purpose of your school project, you should use either sgd or adam.
That is because you are trying to mix functionality from two different libraries: LinearRegressionWithSGD comes from pyspark.mllib (i.e.
while for LinearRegressionWithSGD you have used [something like (hyper-link)]:
Moreover, keep in mind that LinearRegressionWithSGD is [deprecated (hyper-link)] in Spark 2:
UPDATE: Thanks to @rvisio's comment below, we know now that, although [undocumented (hyper-link)], one can actually use solver='sgd' for LinearRegression in pyspark.ml; here is a short example [adapted from the docs (hyper-link)]:
optimizer=sgd to   optimizer='sgd'
In general setting sgd (stochastic gradient descent) works best, also it achieves faster convergence.
While using sgd you apart from setting the learning_rate you also need to set the momentum argument (default value =0.9 works).
./bin/mahout org.apache.mahout.classifier.sgd.TestNewsGroups --input ${WORK_DIR}/20news-bydate/20news-bydate-test/ --model /tmp/news-group.model
There is very little reason to use SGD with momentum anymore unless you're a neural network fiend and know how to tune the learning schedule.
Sometimes also replacing sgd with rmsprop would help.
Any other linear algorithm instead of Passive Aggressive and SGD that might better suit the problem
One quick fix is to use class_weight='auto' during the learning but this is only supported with "SGD" implementation and not with passive aggressive implementation.
Any reason for this given that both use the same underlying sgd implementation.
Tl;dr: SGD is still the goto-method although flawed.
Until someone finds a better way of non-SGD learning.
I don't wanna go into more details, but as far as I know, for deep network, it is highly recommended to use HF optimization (there are many improvement over HF approach as well) since it takes much less time for training, or using SGD with momentum.
another example, if you GET main.html via requests, it does not load main.js and the class of div t1 will not be set as sgd-wrapper
--sgd disables the SGD algorithm enhancements: --adaptive, --normalized, & --invariant.
You missed the most important and only difference between GD ("Gradient Descent") and SGD ("Stochastic Gradient Descent").
Which means that while in the GD algorithm, the order of the samples in each epoch remains constant, in SGD the order is randomly shuffled at the beginning of every epochs.
So every run of GD with the same initialization and hyperparameters will produce the exact same results, while SGD will most defiantly not (as you have experienced).
Here is a quick example of SGD with momentum taken from [here (hyper-link)]
Every DNN is trained with Backpropagation based on some SGD-based algorithm, exactly like in the past.
(There are some new algorithms trying to reduce parameter-tuning with adaptive learning-rates like Adam, RMSprop and co.; but plain SGD is still the most common algorithm and was used for AlphaGo for example)
SGD is not a supported currency for Direct Credit cards with the REST APIs.
SGD is a supported currency for PayPal payments with the REST APIs.
You can start with Adam and see if the model converges, if not go back to SGD.
I've come up with a different approach to implement SGD without an inner loop and the results were also pretty sweet.
For example, below is simplified version of SGD without momentum or Nesterov.
Put this in a file called sgd_cust.py.
may be SGD is better method to train it and of course maybe you do not use proper parameter values for training network with Adam.
You need to pass results2.value to displayConversion, not SGD.value.
Another option is to download Boost and build it using static linking to generate the libboost_thread-vc100-mt-sgd-1_49.lib file.
In this way, you can run an sgd() step (with a different learning rate) for each layer.
I need to make SGD act like batch gradient descent, and this should be done (I think) by making it modify the model at the end of an epoch.
And although in the [SGDClassifier (hyper-link)] docs it is mentioned that
SGD allows minibatch (online/out-of-core) learning
which presumably holds also for SGDRegressor, what is actually meant is that you can use the partial_fit method for providing the data in different batches; the computations (and updates), however, are always performed per sample.
I solved this by simply adding a name argument name='sgd'.
The sklearn SVM is computationally expensive compared to sklearn SGD classifier with loss='hinge'.
Hence we use SGD classifier which is faster.
If we are using 'rbf' kernel, then SGD is not suitable.
I think its because of the batch size used in SGD, if you use full batch with SGD classifier it should take same time as SVM but changing the batch size can lead to faster convergence.
First of all, if we read the documentation of SGDC, it says the linear SVM is used only:
with SGD training
As we can see there is a huge difference between all of them, but linear and SGDC have more or less the same time.
Code of [SGDC (hyper-link)]
How about using large enough batch-size and SGD?
For your SGD_Year_To_Date_Dividends, I suspect you want:
As a begginer choice, I always prefer using the optimizer='adam', this is very often way faster than SGD and you don't need to care much about the learning rate (of course advanced models and best results might take adjustmentes).
Then, we can multiply Revenue by the SGD exchange rate when Currency == 'SGD'.
By your definitions, this would be SGD.
Batch gradient descent would update your weights every 32 examples, so it smooths out the ruggedness of SGD with just 1 example (where outliers may have a lot of impact) and yet has the benefits that SGD has over regular gradient descne.t
batch_size = 1 means indeed stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
Truth is, in practice, when we say "SGD" we usually mean "mini-batch SGD".
In contrast, with batch_size = 1 (SGD case), you expect as many updates as samples in your training data (since this is now the number of your batches), i.e.
You can do this by sending to the printer the following SGD command:
Lets now look into the source code: [https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/master/sklearn/linear_model/sgd_fast.pyx#L657 (hyper-link)]
By default Sequence2Sequence_distributed.py runs data parallel SGD with 32-bit.
Your new SGD optimizer is not optimized for that model.
You can try to restart with lower learning rates, and also try to add moment to the SGD.
