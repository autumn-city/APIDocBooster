For instance, an activity can be visible but partially obscured by a dialog that has focus.  In that case, onPause() will be called, but not onStop(). When the dialog goes away, the activity's onResume() method will be called (but not onStart()).
 The implementation of onPause is very fast because the next activity is not resumed until this method returns.  And is either followed by onResume, if the activity returns back to the front, or onStop, if the activity is becoming invisible to the user.  This is how we implement this onPause callback method. 
On other hands, if some new Activity occurs and occupies the full screen so that your previously running activity is disappeared.  In this Case, your previously running activity is moved to Back Stack. Here, onPause() + onStop() are called.
 So let me just override other methods also.  OnStart and onResume... onPause... onStop... onRestart... and last, onDestroy. 
2- previous activity is completely covered by new activity: both onPause and onStop will be called
