>> The segment of the AI
Show, Cool Libraries.
[MUSIC].
>> All right, Suraj, I thought
you would introduce yourself.
Tell us who you are,
what you do, my friend.
>> Sure. My name is
Suraj Subramanian.
I am working at PyTorch
as a Developer Advocate.
That means I speak to
other developers who
use PyTorch for their
deep learning journey,
and I like to further understand
what they're using PyTorch for,
and see how I can make
that a little easier.
>> Fantastic. Let's start
first with what is PyTorch?
Give us a brief overview of what
PyTorch is for those that don't know.
>> Yeah, PyTorch is
an open-source library that
you can use to build and run
deep learning models
similar to what you have
been using for [inaudible].
If you're familiar with NumPy,
PyTorch brings all of that
scientific computing goodness on
new hardware accelerators like
GPUs and TPUs and all of that.
>> That's awesome.
Why is PyTorch a good
library to get started with
when it comes to deep learning?
>> The primary reason is the API,
PyTorch API is really simple,
but it's also very
powerful. It's pythonic.
If you're familiar with
programming in PyTorch at all,
you'll find yourself
at home using PyTorch.
Another really good
reason to start with
PyTorch is because
it's easy to debug.
The dynamic nature of PyTorch really
allows you to debug
your code very easily.
You can just plug in
print statements just
to keep track of what's
happening in the code.
It also helps you understand
how neural networks work.
It really helps me get
a better intuition
of what's happening under the
hood inside of neural network.
>> That's awesome.
Where can people go?
If someone's like,
"I'm totally excited.
I have the website
just right over here".
Where should people
go to get started?
By the way, you just had a
1.8 release. Is that correct?
>> Yes. We just released
that yesterday.
>> See, timely.
Let's talk about if people
want to get started,
what's the best way
to learn the basics?
>> To learn the basics,
you head to the Tutorial
step on the website.
>> Let's go there. Okay.
>> This section exactly
titled Learn the Basics.
>> What? This is cool.
So tell us about this.
>> So this is the 101 tutorial
to PyTorch that Seth,
Cassie, Dmitri, Ari, and
myself collaborated to build.
It's a great way to get
started with PyTorch
because it's a very
step-by-step guide
to every single station
in a typical ML workflow.
It starts with the
very basics answers,
which are the building blocks of
basically everything in PyTorch.
It progresses sequentially
into how to get your data up,
prepare and load it into your model.
How do you actually
build a neural network?
What's actually happening within
the neural network when you click
or when you run backward which
sets the training loop on.
Also, how do you persist
the neural network
so that you can load
it for later use?
>> I mean, this is really cool.
I mean, I'm looking at this and I
might self-servingly saying
this is really cool, right?
Because like we helped to write it.
But the thing that I
like about this is it
comes from the
developers' perspective.
Look, it's really cool for me to
look at this because like I said,
it's fun and you can
probably get through this.
How long do you think it'll take
for someone to get through this?
>> Probably, I wouldn't say it
takes anything more than an hour.
>> Got it.
>> Even if you run all
of the code in this,
so it's a really quick
way to get started.
>> So who is this for?
For people who are watching,
who would do really well with this?
>> I'd say, it's for anyone
who wants to get
familiar with PyTorch.
All you really need is
some familiarity with
PyTorch programming
and a basic intuition
of what happens in a neural network.
Once you have that,
it's really easy to relate the
concepts in neural network theory
or neural network training to
the actual code if you
follow along this guide.
So the way the guide is structured
is that there is an
explanation and then there's
a relevant code snippet that you can
actually run in a Google
Colab notebook as well.
So you can instantly
relate what you're
reading to the actual code
and see what the output is.
I feel like that just solidifies
your understanding of what
happens in the neural network.
>> Absolutely. Like I said, for me,
the quickstart that I liked
the most is it literally is
end-to-end if you know
already what's going on,
literally here's the code.
>> Yeah, this page
is specifically for
people who are more familiar
with deep learning.
For instance, maybe they have
used deep learning in
other frameworks and
they just want to have a quick skim
through what PyTorch does
and how does it do it?
What are the relevant sub-modules
in PyTorch that do particular tasks?
This is a Text light,
Code heavy sort of page where
you get a whole snapshot of
what's happening
throughout the ML workflow
and PyTorch in just
a single web page.
>> The cool thing is
if you look over here,
let me do a little zoom in here.
I need to move my mouse
here. There you go.
If you do a little zoom in here,
you're going to see like every
section that one would need,
like you need to start with data.
You need to make a model. You need
to construct the model shape.
Then you optimize the
model parameters,
and then you got to save it
and then you've got to use it.
That's literally, I think
at least in my opinion,
this is all it needs to be done.
This is like the whole
process in a single nutshell,
and you see how to do it with
PyTorch every step of the way.
Then you can dive in to
understand each one of these
concepts a little bit more.
That's my favorite part
of this. All right.
So thank you so much, Suraj.
This has been awesome.
For those that don't know, just go to
PyTorch.org and learn the
basics in the tutorial.
Thanks for watching and
we'll see you next time.
