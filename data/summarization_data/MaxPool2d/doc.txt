Applies a 2D max pooling over an input signal composed of several input planes.
In the simplest case, the output value of the layer with input size (N, C, H, W)(N,C,H,W), output (N, C, H_{out}, W_{out})(N,C,H out,Wout) and kernel_size (kH, kW)(kH,kW) can be precisely described as:
If padding is non-zero, then the input is implicitly padded with negative infinity on both sides for padding number of points.
dilation controls the spacing between the kernel points. It is harder to describe, but this link has a nice visualization of what dilation does.
The parameters kernel_size, stride, padding, dilation can either be:
a single int – in which case the same value is used for the height and width dimension
a tuple of two ints – in which case, the first int is used for the height dimension, and the second int for the width dimension
