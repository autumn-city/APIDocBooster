 So where onCreate is called when the activity is first created, onPause it's going to be called when you leave the activity. 
If you can still see any part of it (Activity coming to foreground either doesn't occupy the whole screen, or it is somewhat transparent), onPause() will be called. 
onPause()- Screen is partially covered by other new activity. 
onPause() + onStop()- Screen is fully covered by other new activity. 
1- a part of previous activity is visible or the new activity is transparent: only onPause will be called.
