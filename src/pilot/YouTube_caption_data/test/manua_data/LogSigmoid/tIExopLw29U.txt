Intro
Hello everyone this is Aarohi and welcome back 
to my channel Code with Aarohi in my today's video i  
will talk about what are gan networks what are 
generative adversarial networks so before knowing  
what are gan networks let's see what all kind of 
applications we can develop using game networks  
so one of the example is photos to emojis let's 
suppose if you want to you have a photos and you  
want to convert those photos into our emojis that 
thing if you want to do that task that we can do  
with the help of jan network so in this example 
image only you can see this is the human face and  
this is what we are getting after cartooning for 
that image right so if you want to perform this  
kind of task you can do it with the help of um 
gan network and after that i hope you all have  
heard about the space app right so face app also 
uses gan network for face editing options right so  
more particularly they are using style gans right 
or some similar networks to uh in their face up  
application so you can see this image over here 
i've shown few examples and these are the face  
different face editing options we uh have applied 
so this is the real image and this is what we  
get after applying one face editing option on 
it this is the image without beard and this is  
what we get after applying that particular editing 
option on it and this is like face the aging this  
is the most popular feature of that this face 
app right this is the your the current image of  
a person and this is after applying that aging 
option on it right so this kind of application  
if you want to develop you can use gan networks 
and face aging i've already told you right so i'm  
faced being aging also so so you can see this is 
the current emoji of the person and this is what  
person is getting after applying face d aging 
on it so we can using gan networks for aging  
and for the aging also after that the very um 
one of the very nice feature of gan network is  
uh takes to image translation so in this image 
you can see this uh the text over here this is  
the text which we are giving to our network right 
this flower has the yellow petals along with green  
and yellow stem so this is the text which we are 
giving to our network and this image is the output  
of that network so text to image translation this 
kind of task you can do with the help of gans  
and after that photo editing photograph editing so 
let's suppose this is the real image and on this  
image let's suppose you want to do some changes 
on this image let's say you want to change in hair  
color or the style and then even if you want 
to change the gender of that particular image  
so that also we can do with the help of gam 
networks and reconstruct photographs reconstruct  
photographs simply means you okay just consider 
this example in this image we have you know we  
have just deleted this pixel the this particular 
mask this particular region we have deleted this  
and from this image also we have deleted some 
area and from this also and from this also and now  
we can reconstruct reconstruct simply means 
we can pick the uh features uh from some other  
image and we can put it over here so you can see 
this image then over here the nose area over here  
is different right so in the same way if you see 
the lip area over here is different so this is  
what face reconstruction is reconstructing images 
so this the gan network also helps you know police  
or the authorities to identify criminals that 
might have gone through some you know sort of  
surgeries and to modify their appearances so with 
the help of cad network we can you know identify  
uh such people okay and after that you can say 
okay so this is one image this is the real phase  
and after applying can network on it these are the 
three fake faces we are getting right so guys all  
those examples which i'm showing over here is i 
have collected those random examples from internet  
so my main intent over here is to tell 
you what kind of applications you can  
get so using this gan network let's suppose if 
you give 100 pesos to your network to get training  
on it then gan network will create fake spaces 
those spaces which are not you know non-existent  
so you will get such kind of faces using gap 
networks right so example over here is this  
is the real image then these are the three 
phases which gan network developed after  
the whole training right this kind of task you 
can do with the gan network super resolution this  
features means let's suppose you're having a low 
resolution images and you want to convert those  
images into a high resolution images then you can 
use gan network for that functionality also and  
let's suppose you have a 2d data and you want to 
convert that data into a 3d data right you can you  
know you can develop 3d objects using gan networks 
okay so guys i'm not going in a deeper way which  
particular gam network will do this task because 
there are different kind of gan networks all  
right so for example let's say when we talk about 
convolutional neural network there are different  
kind of convolutional neural network network right 
lx net linear vgg generators net we have lots of  
convolutional neural networks so in the same way 
we have different kind of gan networks also so  
right now collectively i'm telling you what kind 
of applications we can perform using gans in my  
next videos i'll tell you specifically which 
gan network you can use for which particular  
functionality all right so let's go back to 
this ppt again so you can develop 3d objects  
let's say you have a data set which data set is 
2d data set let's see so you can convert that data  
with the into a 3d 3d object uh 3d data using game 
network and after that translating images so over  
here you can say let's suppose you're having 
images satellite images and you want to convert  
those satellite images into a google map you can 
do that with the help of gans and let's say say  
you have images lots of images which you have took 
in a daylight now you want to convert those images  
into a night night version so you can do that with 
the help of gans and let's suppose you have black  
and white images and you want to convert those 
images into a colored images that again you can do  
with the help of games and you can change sketches 
into a colored photographs using gans so these  
kind of things we can do with the help of gan 
networks again this is one more example over here  
you can see what we are doing is we are derailing 
this is the image with rain we are derailing this  
image and this is the output you will get after 
applying that derailing um derailing and again  
this is the image with rain and this is the output 
you get you can do this kind of functionality with  
gans and let's say you have this image and 
there is one gan network fix to pick scan  
on this input you can get this kind of output 
okay and yes um this example i took from this  
particular website actually rosebud dot ai you 
can visit their site and you can see more about it  
so what we are doing over here is these are these 
were the images now these images were converted  
into a you know we uh they performed animation on 
it and now these images become you know live so  
these kind of applications you can perform using 
game here i'll explain you what are gan networks  
so basically gans are generative models so 
generative model simply means means they generate  
new instances right so how i'll show you that how 
so basically before moving to generative models  
let me tell you like there are two type of models 
one are generative models and the other ones are  
discriminative models so discriminative models 
are models like in supervised learning let's  
suppose let me give you one example let's suppose 
you want to know whether the person is diabetic  
or not on the basis of some set of features 
like glucose blood pressure insulin on the basis  
of these three features you want to uh you you 
want to tell whether you your task is to predict  
whether the person is diabetic or not so we have 
given input features and we have a label whether  
the person is diabetic or not not diabetic so this 
is a classification model so this classification  
model is a type of discriminative model okay so 
i hope you are clear about discriminative model  
now the other one is generative model generative 
model simply means to generate new instances okay  
so now if we talk about gan network so gan 
network have two different modules one is  
generator and other one is discriminator right 
so can have two parts generator and discriminator  
the task of generator is to produce fake 
data okay and the task of discriminator  
is to uh is to identify whether the data which 
discriminator is getting whether that is a fake  
data or a real data let me explain you with 
the picture and with the more detailed form  
so what i have told you can contain can have two 
parts one is generator other one is discriminator  
right so we will start our task from here so this 
is a initially when we start training our can  
network initially we will have some random noise 
and this random noise we will give to generator  
now the task of generator is to you know create 
fake data right so generator will create some fake  
sample right from this random noise generator will 
generate some fake data that sample we have over  
here now that fake sample will go to discriminator 
and we are giving one more input to discriminator  
one is fake data which is generated by generator 
and other is real data are real training data  
okay so we are giving our real training data and 
the fake data to the discriminator now the task  
over here is task of discriminator is to 
classify whether the sample which is coming  
to this discriminator whether that sample is 
a fake sample or that sample belongs to the uh  
our real training data okay and after that we will 
calculate the generator loss and the discriminator  
loss right so basically what we are doing is 
giving random noise to generator generator will  
a fake image that fake image and the 
real image will go to discriminator  
discriminator will try to find out which data 
sample is a fake sample and which data sample  
is a real sample and on the basis of which 
we are calculating generator loss and we are  
calculating the loss function for discriminator 
okay so now let's discuss this in more detail so
over here let's see from here okay yeah here 
so discriminator so in my previous video  
this is what i've shown you now i'm discussing 
about discriminator only just see discriminator  
is getting two datas one is fake data one is real 
data and discriminator is basically a classifier  
right it will tell whether the image is real 
or fake okay this is the task of discriminator  
real or fake to classify whether the 
image is a real or a fake okay so and  
this discriminator and generator both are neural 
networks i'll show you practically in my next  
video how to write code for discriminator 
and how to write code for a generator but  
right now just understand that discriminator and 
generator are two neural networks okay so and the  
discriminator act as a classifier and it will 
classify whether the image is a real image or a  
fake image and we are calculating the loss 
function okay now let's say this is the generated  
data right this is the sample which discriminator 
is getting at initial stage see when we whenever  
whenever training begins in the very initial 
epoch what will happen i'm telling you that will  
be a random you know in the very first epoch 
you can see over here in the very first epoch  
we are which data we are giving to our 
network to our generator this random noise  
right in an initial epoch so what will happen 
generator will easily know right this is the  
real data suppose this is the real data means 
our training data sample from our training data  
and this is the uh generated data the fake sample 
which we got after applying generator on it  
right so over here discriminator can easily 
tell this is a fake data and this is a real data  
okay because over here uh this is a very initial 
epoch right so our discriminator can easily tell  
like this is a fake data and this is a real data 
and after one epoch we will update the weights  
the same way as we update weights in deep learning 
other neural networks the same way we will update  
the weight and we'll use that propagation for that 
okay now this is the output of first epoch let's  
see after that let's say this is the output we 
get after 20 epochs after running a model for 20  
epochs this is what our generator is giving this 
is the fake data which we get from generator and  
this is the real data now again discriminator 
can easily tell that this is a fake data and  
this is the real data and after that we'll again 
update the weight and we'll again train our model  
right next week so let's say after 50 or 60 epochs 
this is the output this is the fake phase which  
generator is giving right this is the fake data 
generated by a generator and this is the real data  
now over here discriminator is classifying this is 
a real and this obviously as a real so uh are you  
getting my point what i'm trying to say okay let's 
see this picture this at initial epoch we gave  
this image and after running few epochs this is 
the image which generator uh generates and this is  
the real uh image so this is the fake face created 
by generator and this is the real phase from our  
data set both the faces are going to discriminator 
and the task of discriminator is to tell  
if this space is a fake so discriminatory should 
tell us this this face is a fake and for real face  
discriminator should tell this is a real phase 
but now discriminator will get fooled by generator  
because this generated image is you know exactly 
a face like the above face but obviously with some  
changes but this is because this is a fake face 
we have generated but now discriminator will get  
fooled by a generator right so let's understand 
this let me uh tell you what this uh what is that  
what is the main motive of generator and what is 
the main motif of discriminator with this example  
just think that this generator is a team of 
counterfeiters okay so their task is to generate  
fake money and the task of discriminator 
discriminators let's say discriminator is a  
team of cop they are police people right and the 
task of police people the task of discriminator  
is to uh you know find out whether 
this is a fake money or a real money  
right now these counterfeiters will you know work 
hard try hard to make this fake sample fake money  
uh like that so that the team of cops that this 
discriminator should not be able to recognize  
whether this is a fake sample of fake money or 
a real money right means this discriminator and  
this generator both will work hard but motive of 
generator is why um this generator is working hard  
the generator is working hard these 
counterfeiters are working hard to make the  
fake sample more likely to the real money 
and the task of discriminator is to find out  
that this is a fake fan right so both are working 
for different motives they are working like uh  
they are working hard to make this money uh fake 
money make us more real and they are working hard  
to find out so that generator can't pull them 
out okay so this is how this gan network work so  
and i've told you like after every epoch 
discriminator and generator both will  
update the weights using bath propagation and 
then they will work for the next epochs okay  
so in conclusion see what we have studied what 
we have learned is in gyan network we have  
two main modules one is generator and one is 
discriminator generator will generate the fake  
sample discriminator will try to find out whether 
the sample which uh discriminator is getting  
whether act as a classifier and it tries to find 
out whether that sample is a fake sample or a  
real sample and we will um update the wait for 
after every epoch generator is getting training  
to so that uh generator via a wi-fi training 
generator generator is getting training  
to generate fake samples which looks 
more similar or exactly similar to the  
real samples and discriminator 
is getting training to classify  
fake samples with more accuracy and real samples 
with more accuracy so this is how it will work so  
now in my next class i'll show you the practical 
implementation of gan network i'll show you how  
to write a code for uh generator how to write a 
code for discriminator and how to run gan network  
on emini's data set first of all and then using 
gan network i'll show you how to we will use a  
data set of faces and we'll try to generate fake 
faces from it right so guys i hope you like the  
video and guys if you like my video then please 
subscribe my channel and thank you for watching  
right so today i'll show you the different loss 
functions for generator and discriminator right  
so we initially started with this picture right 
so this is the random noise for when we want to  
train our algorithm and in very initial epoch 
this will be the random noise and from this this  
random noise will go to generator generator will 
um you know uh generate a fake image so let's say  
in the very first epoch when we give this random 
noise to generator generator generated this image  
means this this much this white area simply means 
this is a blank area right so in the way after the  
first epoch this is the fake image which generator 
generated now obviously when you give this image  
to discriminator and this is a real sample over 
here discriminator can tell very easily that this  
is a fake image right so uh after that when you 
uh after that discriminate just discriminator will  
tell us the classification error now just assume 
this x is a real data means training data point  
this x hat is uh because i'm going to explain you  
the formula so i'm just telling you the 
x stands for the real data x hat simply  
means the fake data which we will get after from 
this generator that is the random noise okay and
okay so this is the first ebook and after that it 
will classy it will give us classification error  
and in second epoch see first epoch this 
this is the fake image and in second epoch  
this is the fake image generated by generator now 
over here also discriminator can will give us the  
classification error and on the basis of that 
classification error we will update the weight  
of discriminator and we will update the weight 
of generator using back propagation okay so this  
now after few epochs so this is the image 
fake image generated by the generator  
again after that we will update the weights of 
discriminator and update the weight of generator  
using that propagation okay and after 
let's say after 60 or 70 epochs this is the  
fake data generated by the generator and this is 
the real data and again we are calculating the  
um classification error and updating the weights 
okay now see classification after calculating this  
classification error okay wait after calculating 
this classification error what we are doing is  
we are updating the weight of discriminator and we 
are also updating the weight of generator now let  
me show you after classification we are using back 
propagation to update the weight drop generator  
and what is the objective of this generator 
the objective of generator is to maximize  
the discriminator classification error 
maximize what to maximize the discriminator  
classification its task is to maximize 
the classification error of discriminator  
and the objective of discriminator is to minimize 
the classification error means discriminator task  
is to minimize this classification error generator 
task is to maximize the classification error  
now what i'm trying to say over here is 
the generator is creating the fake data  
and generator wants to fold the generator uh 
generator wants to fold the discriminator by uh  
by you know saying like okay no this is not 
a fake data this is a real data so what that  
means is generator wants to give fake data to 
discriminator and the objective of generator  
is to make that sample uh as much as real 
it can so that discriminator was not able to  
classify uh so that discriminator should 
classify it as a real sample means  
we are maximizing the discriminator 
loss and the task of discriminator is to  
find out that the the image which is coming from 
generator that uh that image is a fake image  
this is the objective of discriminator so how we 
are how we are updating the weight for generator  
we are updating the weight of generator in order 
to maximize the discriminator classification error  
and we are updating the weight of discriminator 
in order to minimize this classification error  
so i hope you understand what we are doing over 
here means the classic means the loss function of  
generator the loss function of generator 
what is the okay leave it just understand  
that generator will try to maximize this 
classification error and discriminator  
will try to minimize this classification 
error okay so now let's go to the function  
so the there are lots of other loss functions 
also but in my today's class i'm going to discuss  
mid max loss function and this is that function 
looks like okay okay so let's see over here so  
this is the minimax locks function so basically 
this loss function derives from the cross entropy  
loss function so we have used cross entropy loss 
function in our uh lots of neural networks right  
so what we are doing over here is this part this 
much part this is the discriminator output for  
real data means whenever discriminator will get 
real data this is the function for that loss  
function for that and this is the discriminator 
output for fake data okay so this is the output  
for discriminator output for real data and this 
is the discriminator output for fake data and what  
this e x is over here e x is simply the expected 
value over all the data instances and this log d x  
i have already told you this this d x is basically 
a discriminator's probability that real uh data  
real data instances are real okay so 
this is basically a probability value  
uh and this dx discriminators okay discriminators 
probability you can see over here also that  
the real data is a real and e x is there g this 
g simply means generator and z if you remember  
i've told you this z over here 
this is a random noise okay
so that's what we are writing over here generator  
g of z simply means a random z is a that 
random noise and this g is a generator  
and d is a discriminator output for fake data so 
this random noises of egg data only know generator  
will create a fake data on the basis of this 
so that that's what we have written over here  
so this is the formula which um we use min 
max the formula name is min max loss function  
okay so this is the formula we will use for this 
particular objective okay now we can write this  
formula like this also if we want to write 
it in a python so log sigmoid discriminator  
loss function discriminate output for real data 
and discriminator output for um fake data okay
you
