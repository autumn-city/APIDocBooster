This API is <dispatchTouchEvent> in android library.

Function: 
Pass the touch screen motion event down to the target view, or this view if it is the target.
In the normal event flow this function will be called by the Android framework before it is passed on to the view. So, any further processing of the motion event inside this function must be carefully designed to avoid conflicts with the view's own event handling mechanism. If the motion event is not consumed by this function, it will be passed on to the next views in the hierarchy until it is consumed or all views have been traversed. The dispatchTouchEvent can propagate the motion event down the hierarchy or intercept it completely.

Parameter: ev MotionEvent: The motion event to be dispatched.; boolean True if the event was handled by the view, false otherwise.
The event object contains the specifics of the motion including the position, action performed and other similar attributes. If the function returns true then android system will consider this event as handled and it will not propagate it further. In case of false, the system will send it to the next target in the hierarchy. It is important to return true for events that you do handle to prevent unnecessary propagation.

Notes: None
The dispatchTouchEvent function is part of Androidâ€™s input system and it plays a critical role in dispatching input events. It's important to note that this method is typically called as part of standard view functioning and should not be called explicitly by application code. Calling this method directly could lead to unexpected results, thus should be avoided. Furthermore, any modifications related to the event must be done judiciously as it can affect the input events of other views. Lastly, the function does not handle click events or long press events. It only dispatches motion events.
