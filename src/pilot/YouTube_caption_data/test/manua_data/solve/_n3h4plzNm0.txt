hello guys my name is naveed and welcome to my 
youtube channel as we discussed that in this  
channel we'll discuss everything ready to ai 
machine learning Computer Vision and nlp now  
we are going to start an interesting playlist like 
we will discuss the artificial intelligence news  
in the field of data science yes so today we are 
going to introduce some you can say recommendation  
system library so first of all i want to introduce 
you some background actually recommended system  
are a very big part of today ai field so if you 
want to define what is recommendation system as  
a field you can say like it is the learning 
of model our sparse and sequential events  
and it has lot of you can see ooverlap with 
other ai fields so what is torch rec actually  
torch rack is you can say is a new pytorch 
domain library for recommendation system  
and this library includes standard sparsity 
and parallelism primitive and it is allowing  
researchers to create and implement cutting edge 
customization models actually by the middle of  
2020 the pytorch team had received a lot of 
feedback that open source file touch ecosystem  
lacked a large scale production quality 
recommendation system package while looking for  
a solution meta developers offer a meta production 
recommendation system and they stack as a pytorch  
domain library so this benefit researchers and 
companies across the recommendation system domain  
so if we discuss what is performance okay 
so it was utilized to train one point  
two five trillion parameters model that went 
live in january and three trillion parameter  
model that will go live soon so this should 
indicate that Pytorch can solve the most complex  
recommendation system challenge in the industry so 
if you want to see the source code go to this link  
i will paste this link in the description 
and this is the open source actually why  
meta developer make it open source so the 
advantage of open source and open technology  
are numerous actually meta is providing a 
state-of-the-art recommendation system package  
to python community in the hope that many people 
would contribute to its development and it is  
allowing new researchers and assisting 
numerous business so that's it for today
