I found one here: [clamp (hyper-link)]
Starting with .NET Core 2.0 System.Math now has a [Clamp (hyper-link)] method that can be used instead:
Method name uses the appropriate verb tense (ed) to (further) indicate that the value is not clamped in-place, and that, instead, a new value is returned (See [@JimBalter's comment (hyper-link)]).
Limitations:
No one-sided clamps.
This will also allow you to clamp a number only by its min or max.
I've found this useful for clamping values calculated from linear equations (y=mx+b) where the slope of the line can be increasing or decreasing.
or clamp the argument to the range:
Is there any built in function for clamping to a range?
Having looked at the generic clamp method offered up in another answer, it is worth noting that this has [boxing/unboxing (hyper-link)] considerations for primitive types.
[Add clamp(value: Bound) -> Bound to ClosedInterval (hyper-link)]
to add another method which clamps a single value to the given interval:
Using the implementation of the existing clamp() method at
as an example, this additional clamp() method can be implemented as
So you can extend all Range protocols at once with a clamp method by declaring a custom protocol:
Extension of Comparable/Strideable similar to ClosedRange.clamped(to:_) -> ClosedRange from standard Swift library.
With Swift 5.1, the idiomatic way to achieve the desired clamping would be with [property wrappers (hyper-link)].
While I truly love ranges in Swift, I really think the absolutely standard syntax for a clamp function ("for 50 years now in every computer language") is just simpler and better:
IMO the two values in a clamp function are not really a 'range' - they're just "two values".
The shortest (but maybe not most efficient) way to clamp, is:
You can define a utility clamp function:
This does not want to be a "just-use-a-library" answer but just in case you're using Lodash you can use [.clamp (hyper-link)]:
In the spirit of arrow sexiness, you could create a micro
clamp/constrain/gate/&c.
Also if you have a look [here (hyper-link)], there is no clamp function in Java either.
A clamp function is simple to write and apparently authors thought that it is not used often enough to have it in the standard library.
After searching for mathematical functions on [this standards committee (hyper-link)] page, I couldn't find any mention of a clamp() function.
This leads me to believe that a function like clamp() is absent from the standard library, simply because no-one has proposed it.
This would include clamp() as well :-)
The other answers are no longer valid, as [std::clamp (hyper-link)] is now in C++17.
Normal clamp:
Smoothclamp (guaranteed to agree with normal clamp for x < min and x > max):
Sigmoid (Approximates clamp, never smaller than min, never larger than max)
For some purposes Sigmoid will be better than Smoothclamp because Sigmoid is an invertible function - no information is lost.
For other purposes, you may need to be certain that f(x) = xmax for all x > xmax - in that case Smoothclamp is better.
Also, as mentioned in another answer, there is a whole family of Smoothclamp functions, though the one given here is adequate for my purposes (no special properties other than a smooth derivative needed)
It reduces to the regular clamp function given N=0 (0 times differentiable), and gives increasing smoothness as you increase N. You can visualize it like this:
C++ has no built in clamp function.
You can either implement your own, or if you happen to be using [boost (hyper-link)] it has a [clamp function (hyper-link)].
C++17 introduced [std::clamp() (hyper-link)].
Just use std::clamp(a, 0.0, 1.0)
If you don't have C++17 but boost is an option then use [boost::algorithm::clamp(n, lower, upper); (hyper-link)]
Implement saturating clamp the standard way with x = min(max(x, lower_limit), upper_limit), using whatever width of integer you want.
Or let a compiler auto-vectorize std::clamp for you.
I couldn't seem to find a proper site for TextOverflowClamp.js.
You were adding an additional resize handler every time you called loadClamp and there was really no reason for this.
Additionally, it is important that you place the TextOverflowClamp code before your own code.
Several solutions to the problem of multi-line truncation with ellipsis are discussed here: [http://css-tricks.com/line-clampin/ (hyper-link)]
The CSS Overflow Level 3 specification [defines a standard line-clamp (hyper-link)] property (without the quirks the ´-webkit-` prefixed solution has).
Using JavaScript ([Clamp.js (hyper-link)])
[code snippet]
Pros: Display as expected and is flexible through different options.
that the -webkit-line-clamp is obsolete – may no longer be true.
The two else if statements clamps the values so camera doesn't go too close or too far away from the minCameraDistance and maxCameraDistance values.
There are several overloaded clamp builtin functions in OpenCL; the compiler needs to select exactly one, based on the types of the arguments.
The clamp() problem is indeed fixed by making sure that the last two arguments are floats.
Probably not your issue, but worth noting: Between OpenCL 1.0 and 1.1 clamp changed slightly, so if you are not careful you can have code that compiles in one version and not the other.
Specifically, in the OpenCL 1.1 specification, "Appendix F – Changes", "F.1 Summary of changes from OpenCL 1.0" it says "The following features are added to the OpenCL C programming language (section 6):", then "New built-in functions", then "clamp integer function defined in section 6.11.3"
You can use raster::clamp
The problem is that std::clamp is declared as follows:
Also, it is not save to store the result of std::clamp to a reference if not all arguments to std::clamp are lvalues.
std::clamp returns one of its arguments by-reference.
This technically doesn't apply to your line with variable type const int&, because the type mismatch between that and the returned reference from std::clamp will cause creation of a temporary which will then bind to p and be life-time extended.
In a comment you link you should an alternative implementation for clamp as a macro.
If you want a std::clamp alternative that accepts different types, then you can write it as a function template yourself, e.g.
Also think carefully about whether you actually want to use clamp with different argument types (This applies to both the implementation I show above as well as the macro you are using).
I guess your update is being executed before the ScrollRect update, so your Clamp could be overwritten by the ScrollRect's update (I'm not sure if this explanation is clear).
The Clamp function of the dart is actually taking the number not the sign of the number
Here's the code of Mathf.Clamp[code snippet]
Based on the code you posted and understanding Mathf.Clamp should work as intended, the issue is most probably laying in your code, at least at one point, e.g.
If you want to clamp the angle so that it stays within the range but it wraps around when it reaches max or min (instead of clipping to the limits) then you could use this fairly simple function I worte using python:
A C analog to the clamp_to_range function would look like this:
If clamping is rare, you can test the need to clamp with a single test:
So if you find or know a way to clamp integers you can use it for (IEEE 754) floats as well.
In fact, if your compiler uses the intrinsic, you can use it to implement your clamp directly:
Rather than testing and branching, I normally use this format for clamping:
They confer more than an order of magnitude increase in performance compared with clamping with std::min/max.
Edit: Initially I wrote the clamp function as commented.
If one of the terms is zero (as is often the case when you're clamping) the code simplifies a bit further:
If you want to use fast absolute value instructions, check out this snipped of code I found in [minicomputer (hyper-link)], which clamps a float to the range [0,1]
> gcc -O3 -march=native -Wall -Wextra -Wc++-compat -S -fverbose-asm clamp_ternary_operator.c
> clang -O3 -march=native -Wall -Wextra -Wc++-compat -S -fverbose-asm clamp_ternary_operator.c
Yes, clamp only x value:
It appears we cannot add a listener "legally" to an Animated Diff Clamp when that Diff Clamp is declared in the Render.
The solution is to take the value of the Diff Clamp and interpolate that into a new variable.
Actually you have two functions clamp and clamp!.
Function clamp accepts only scalars for all arguments.
So the only accepted usage is like clamp(3, 4, 5).
Function clamp!
Call clamp.
(x, lo, hi) is a broadcasted application of function clamp.
This means that clamp.
(x, 4, 5) will create a new vector (most of the time - see a comment below for an exception), while clamp!
clamp.
([1,2,3], [3,1,6], [4,5,7]) and broadcast all arguments, which clamp!
One more important difference between clamp.
and clamp!
(being a natural consequence that clamp!
is in-place) is that broadcasting clamp works on immutable argument, e.g.
clamp.
(0:0.1:1, 0.25, 0.75) will work, while clamp!
The new clamped AnimatedValue is what you use to clamp stuff.
I suggest that this.state.animatedPos would typically be used to for touch events and the Animated.decay, and the clamped AnimatedValue for interpolation, styling etc...
However, because you used the same variable both for screen space and world space position of the target, you likely got confused and clamped the position after converting it to world space.
Actually, the problem is that you're clamping a position, not a rotation.
You'll have to use trigonometry to calculate the angle it wants to point in (more specifically, the atan2 function), clamp that value to (-70, 70), and then apply that rotation to the object (using euler angles).
For future reference, try also limiting the max-height, in your case for a 7 line clamp, max-height: 8.75 rem might do it, as it did for me.
This will also make it work not only on Safari iOS, but also IE, as line-clamp [is not supported on IE (hyper-link)].
[Clamp (hyper-link)]
You think that the browser will first apply auto to height in order to find the value of the height based on the content then convert that value to px and then apply the clamp() using that value but no.
The browser will try to first resolve clamp(200px, auto, 400px) which is invalid because auto is not a <calc-value>.
An actual clamp function will make sure a number is within 2 numbers (a lower bounds and upper bounds).
So psudo code would be clamp(55, 1, 10) would produce 10 and clamp(-15, 1, 10) would produce 1 where clamp(7, 1, 10) would produce 7.
I know you are looking for more of an in_array method but for those who get here from Google, here is how you can clamp in PHP without making a function (or by making this into a function).
A simple clamp method would be:
In general, yes it is, [Mathf.Clamp (hyper-link)] has two overloads:
public static float Clamp(float value, float min, float max);
public static int Clamp(int value, int min, int max);
You can use [MathHelper.Clamp() (hyper-link)] for clamp and GraphicsDevice.Viewport for the screen size:
So instead of transform.position, try clamping rigidbody.position inside of FixedUpdate.
I use Mathf.Clamp to limit the movement before applying it to rigidbody.position.
If you are willing to write your own clamp function, you can detect this and do something about it.
For example, suppose you want the clamp function to return by value if that is the only way to ensure that we don't get a dangling reference:
This would make clamp(n, 0, 255) effectively have the signature int clamp(int&, int&&, int&&); you'd only get int & clamp(int&, int&, int&) if all 3 inputs are lvalue references.
You're never assigning the clamped value to the rotation.
chest.rotation = ClampRotation(chest.rotation, new Vector3(0, 60, 0));
Forget the ClampRotation Function and try the following code :
Im stupid
To fix horizontal rotation just should remove yClamp)))
Thanks a lot
So rotX = Mathf.Clamp(rotX, -90f, 90f); actually works
Im just stupid, ive made it without - operator first)
There are several things which effect the safety of the machine that cannot be controlled via the standard API, chuck clamp / unclamp being one of them.
Clamping means that you limit your value to a certain range.
I recently had to implement a cross browser line clamp (IE10+) and wasn't happy with anything I found out there, so I rolled my own.
I started with the clamp.js logic and tweaked it from there for performance and accuracy.
Instead of clamping the rotation of the camera's rigid body, I clamp how much rotation is applied before.
You could re-center your euler angles around the center value then clamp the difference:
And then just call the ClampAngle method where ever you need to clamp a value, for example:
I've called it in my camera rotation function to clamp both rotX and rotY, which is later applied to the rotation of my orientation game object.
But this way, you can simply say $range.clamp(5), for instance.
OK, so I found the solution which clamps the angle correctly in all cases,
My reading of the GLSL spec is that no clamping is done:
Well, I'd assuming you'd want to clamp each of the coordinates individually.
Hence, you only need to clamp the distance from the origin R.
clamp() enables selecting a middle value within a range of values between a defined minimum and maximum.
Mathf.Clamp clamps a value between two numbers: [https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Clamp.html (hyper-link)]
So you should just clamp the position of the puck between those values.
CLK_ADDRESS_CLAMP_TO_EDGE – out-of-range image coordinates are clamped to the extent.
CLK_ADDRESS_CLAMP – out-of-range image coordinates will return a border colour.
Perhaps a workaround would be to use TileMode.CLAMP with a transparent edge color in the bitmap.
It rotates a camera around a target and clamps the Y rotation.
If that's the case then this is not best done with the clamp function.
Auto clamps on resizing!
A text property of the text you want clamped and a numeri lines property denoting how many lines you want displayed.
You can provide a controls object as <TextClamp controls={ ... } now.
Text-clamp.js
Text-clamp.scss
Instead of assigning line clamp css to h1 assign to element that has long text in this case it is <a href="#">Long title goes here</a>.
Edit: [Apparently, XNA has the MathHelper class which has a Clamp method (hyper-link)].
A typical clamp function is max(minimum, min(value, maximum)).
Combined, the two clamp the value.
The min-height answer above does work - but I also noticed that the clamp() function does work correctly on its own, but only on page load.
As far as I know, clamp for integers is safe and should work just fine, but Rust gives me the error
That's because the [Ord::clamp (hyper-link)] method is unstable — the compiler isn't lying to you.
How would you make the yMax have no clamp?
If you don't want to constrain the max value for Y, use Mathf.Max instead of Mathf.Clamp:
One way to go is use Box2D and its [Revolute joint (hyper-link)] to simulate a clamp.
Basically clamp is 3 dynamic bodies: hull, and two side bodies that are marked as "ghost" for the hull (so that they do not collide).
When a prize is hit by clamp you keep them joints working for body not to fall down thanks to mentioned friction.
A very simple solution is to clamp _elevation to ±90 using Mathf.Clamp:
If you simply want to do the same thing as a 2D clamp would - [Vector3.Clamp (hyper-link)] set the Y (usually 'UP') component of the two bounding vectors you pass to be 0.
Just use Vector3.Clamp(Vector3 value1, Vector3 min, Vector3 max) and use the constructor on Vector3 that takes a Vector2 and an int (for z value).
You are invoking Clamp with the form uint.Clamp(int, int) => uint.
This gets converted by the compiler to Clamp(unit, int, int) => uint.
The compiler though is effectively expecting Clamp(T, T, T) => T, so the it reports an error as the mixture of uint and int types prevent it resolving what type T should take.
You are calling Clamp<T>(T, T, T) with arguments uint, int, int (as 0 and 255 are int literals).
Yes, they are clamped automatically if the color buffer is in a normalized fixed-point format.
The conversion from a floating-point value f to the corresponding unsigned normalized fixed-point value c is defined by first clamping f to the range [0, 1], then ...
Explicitly clamping in the fragment shader would be a waste of operations if your frame buffer format is of a normalized fixed-point type (like the typical GL_RGBA8).
Extra clamping operations in the shader would most likely be very cheap, but certainly unnecessary.
As implied by the spec quote above, no clamping is applied in this case.
As of Firefox version 68 [Firefox supports -webkit-line-clamp (hyper-link)]!
Note: [CSS Overflow Module Level 3 Editor's draft (hyper-link)] includes an official property [line-clamp (hyper-link)] - which will likely replace the proprietary-webkit-line-clamp property.
-webkit-line-clamp is for browsers that use webkit.
If you're interested - you could take a look at [my answer here (hyper-link)]: a [line-clamp with fade-out fallback fiddle (hyper-link)] which adds a fade-out effect workaround (instead of ellipsis) for non-webkit browsers.
In firefox, -webkit-line-clamp don't work
/----line clamp---/
/----line clamp end---/
Did you try to use „Mathf.clamp” method?
It's cross browser compatible ( -Webkit-line-clamp is not support by IE and Firefox ) and works like a charm.
If out.b is uchar:
out.b = clamp(out.b, (uchar)0, (uchar)255)
So make the "happy path" return 'n' (the most probable outcome of calling 'Clamp'):
As per a comment from Andyweb, the solution posted at [css - multi line line-clamp (ellipsis) doesn't work (hyper-link)] is something that works for me.
I had this problem where line clamp didn't work but adding word-wrap:break-word in my styles made it work.
Ps: this happened to me when the div that has line clamp style was wrapped inside another div that has ngIf directive applied to it .
Set temporary the -webkit-line-clamp to initial.
Count the number of lines, check if its more than the original -webkit-line-clamp.
If it is, the text was clamped.
Reset the -webkit-line-clamp.
Detecting CSS [line-clamp (hyper-link)] by javascript can be made by comparing the scrollHeight and the clientHeight of the "clamped" element.
The below example shows a clamped text.
Calculate your new position, clamp its z component, then assign to position.
C++17 has std::clamp.
If std::clamp is not available, you can implement your own until C++17 comes around, e.g.
testing this on godbolt, gcc vectorised it and completely eliminated the redundant copy of clamp.
The message "Clamp target GC heap" is by logged by the VM when it gets desperate, a heap allocation fails, and the heap is returned to a previous ideal limit after the attempt.
I don't think there's a way to specify the clamp but you can do the obvious and add a 1 pixel black (zero) border around the edge and offset your addressing by 1.
It shouldn't be much more data and it'll get you the clamping for free.
We can also clamp the boundary and trap it (make kernel fail) what is the default when using the surface memory.
Use Mathf.clamp() function.
Ruby 2.4.0 introduces [Comparable#clamp (hyper-link)]:
So whenever I want to clamp anything, I can just call:
I think the range class is a good candidate for a clamp method
I don't like this, because the clamp function only is correct for 3 element arrays
It accepts three floating points and clamps interpolates third argument between first and second.
This looks like a bug to me, as Clamp i.e.
clamp_ip needs another Rect as argument:
If the image format is normalized, the values that are written are clamped to [0, 1] and normalized.
You can use Vector2.SignedAngle and Mathf.Clamp to do this.
This is a little function I use to clamp the rotation in an FPS up/down aim rotation.
In order to ensure that the boundaries of an orthographic camera don't leave a Bounds you need to include the extents of the camera's view as padding to your clamps.
You're using $clamp but not actually setting the value, I've never used the Clamp before, but it'll either be:
To be fair the [Math.Clamp (hyper-link)] method never fails (according to the docs), so this distinction is mostly academic in your case.
It does not have to clamp anything, technically.
In other words, if the internal format and the format of the data you are transfering into the texture differ, then lots of interesting things can happen including scaling/clamping to a certain range.
If you properly match internal format and pixel transfer format you can avoid implicit normalization and clamping of the image data since no conversion will be necessary.
Of course, pixel transfer is only one source of clamping.
The selected groups are transferred to the GL as described in section 8.4.4 and then clamped to the representable range of the internal format.
If the internalformat of the texture is signed or unsigned integer, components are clamped to [−2n−1, 2n−1 − 1] or [0, 2n − 1], respectively, where n is the number of bits per component.
For color component groups, if the internalformat of the texture is signed or unsigned normalized fixed-point, components are clamped to [−1, 1] or [0, 1], respectively.
For depth component groups, the depth value is clamped to [0, 1].
it will clamp angle to -180 to 180
[https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Mathf.Clamp.html (hyper-link)]
Have a go at [line-clamp (hyper-link)].
Essentially what I changed was to make the "clamp" part and "set view position" know when a change in size has been made.
By doing it yourself, you made most values greater than 1.0 and thus Metal clamped them to 1.0 before doing its own conversion to 8Unorm.
This is a bug in some old version webkit browser.Just remove the "href" of the tag "a",or do not set the "-webkit-line-clamp" for the tag "a".The new  version of the chrome has fixed the bug.
Set height of text container and use webkit-line-clamp accordingly.
Clamp the final Y direction value not the current mouse movement -
You are clamping your delta rotation - not your actual rotation.
For example, paddusb instruction can add 16 pairs of bytes at once with saturation (clamps results in byte range).
If the values to be clamped are just above 255 or below zero, you can use a lookup table.
And the byte_clamp_lut+256 is translated by compiler into single memory reference into the middle of the table.
Ended up writing my own component to use clamp.js directly and it works nicely.
Triggering clamp.js as soon as the component mounts.
I tested this on Litmus and found these email clients supported -webkit-line-clamp: Apple Mail (macOS), iPhone (iOS 14.2), Samsung (Android 7).
This could happen if the element with -webkit-line-clamp has it's visibility set to hidden when it first renders, either directly or by inheriting from one of its parent.
This is due to this webkit bug: [-webkit-line-clamp is not respected when visibility is hidden (hyper-link)].
Then, you can take the forward vector it "wants" to go, and find the signed angle between the world direction of RotationRangeCenter and that point, then clamp it to ±RotationRangeExtent:
Finally, rotate the monitor so that its forward aligns with the clamped forward and its right doesn't change.
If that's not desired behavior, you might consider interpolating from SignedAngle(worldRotationRangecenter, targetForward, toRotate.right) to clampedAngle, for a movement between the limits:
There is the ready-available SamplerState.PointClamp, or you can create your own.
You can set the address mode to clamp in this line.
I could not find -webkit-line-clamp or line-clamp anywhere.
u, v and w need to be clamped between 0..1.
Try clamping u and v to 0..1 and then set w = 1 - u - v to keep the normalization constraint.
In case anyone want to know, I solved it by first 
clamping u and v and w = 1 - u - v than 
clamping u and w and v = 1 - u - w than
clamping v and w and u = 1 - v - w
the other 2 suggested solutions gave me weird outputs and dident seem  to clamp correctly.
You can't clamp a point to a triangle that way if you want to find the shortest distance from a point to a triangle.
Clamping barycentric coordinates in any way that does not take into account the transformation back to Cartesian space will simply not work.
I realise this is an old question, but it hasn't really been answered yet, and it's currently the first hit on Google for "clamp barycentric coordinates".
Clamp01() returns t if it is between 0 and 1, 0 if it is negative, or 1 if it is greater than 1.
So trying to clamping the velocity has no effect because the force you are applying to the RigidBody will be applied after the clamp.
This is a guess because I'm not so familiar with physics in Unity3D, but I think you can clamp it just after the physics engine update if you use [WaitForFixedUpdate (hyper-link)].
I have been facing the exact same issue and also made a question regarding it here: [Ionic 4: -webkit-line-clamp property not applying on inital load (hyper-link)]
I have found that in my case I have ion-slides ([https://ionicframework.com/docs/api/slides (hyper-link)]) implemented in my HTML (The same HTML file where I am facing this issue) which seems to be causing for all my styles to still apply besides from -webkit-line-clamp: 2
When I remove all instances of ion-slides within that file then my -webkit-line-clamp: 2 css rule applies correctly on initial load.
I'm still trying to figure out how I can have both ion-slides and -webkit-line-clamp: 2 however i'll update this answer if I end up finding a proper solution.
I noticed that I would be rendering the ion-slides last as it was dependent on the data returned from a HTTP call which seemed to have an impact on the rest of the HTML elements and their styling (In this case the -webkit-line-clamp rule) when the ion-slides was fully rendered on the page.
CLAMP just tells OpenGL what to do when the coordinates go outside the range 0 -> 1.
These are some macros that I been using since forever, for min, max and clamp.
As I mentioned in the comments, the clamping function in your code does not actually work - you need to convert the numbers to integers before doing the addition (and then you can check if the integer is greater than 255).
That way, you can also define + on colors (with clamping) and it will make your code simpler (but still, 10 constructor arguments is a bit scary, so I'd try to think if there is a way to simplify that a bit).
Using the type, you can then add colors pretty easily and do not have to add clamping each time you need to do that.
Actually you cannot "clamp" x and y values because x and y are interdependent.
So the clamp function would return a infinite set of correct values (or not any if there is no solution).
If you want a solution to your problem you should maybe add more condition(s) to the specification of the clamp function.
You could say for example that the clamp function must minimize max(displacementX, displacementY).
If you add this condition then clamp function would return a single or no solution.
As DARK_DUCK said there are ways (non-trivial ways) to write a clamp function that solves your problem.
However, when you say "clamp" I automatically assume that your solution must restrict users from reaching some invalid states which IMHO is not a good solution.
Instead of clamping the photo coordinates in the original coordinate system, you need to clamp them in the rotated coordinate system.
You need to construct an axis-aligned bounding box of the crop area in the rotated coordinate system which you can use for clamping.
You can't clamp a Quaternion.
You could however rather store the float of the angle you already rotated and clamp that instead:
The error refers to your texture addressing mode (ie: does the texture wrap around at the edges, or is it clamped at the edges).
Use one of the overloads for SpriteBatch.Begin ([MSDN (hyper-link)]) that takes a SamplerState, and pass in SamplerState.LinearClamp ([MSDN (hyper-link)]).
The default for SpriteBatch.Begin is SamplerState.LinearClamp, so you must be setting a different state (eg: LinearWrap) onto the graphics device somewhere else in your code?
Even Opera has it's own way to handle clamping, which is super annoying.
You could use clamp.js to handle your ellipsis but if you're a fan of pure CSS solutions like me - try that:
[CSS Ellipsis: How to Manage Multi-Line Ellipsis in Pure CSS (hyper-link)]
You can use the JavaScript technique, clamp.js, but I've also created this pure CSS version: [http://codepen.io/n3ptun3/pen/meYKgZ?editors=110 (hyper-link)]
And since clamping is not default behavior in shaders, they would have to remember to clamp between combine stages.
If your implementation doesn't clamp like the spec says it should, the best you can do is file a bug report on it.
There is no such method in ILNumerics, which clamps the values of an array to certain limits.
In order to clamp the values of an array ranging from 1 ..4 to 2..3 you could do:
The data are clamped, because the internal format of the texture which is attached to the color plane of the framebuffer is GL_RGBA (which is the same as GL_RGBA8).
This causes that the representation of the data in the data store of the texture is clamped.
When the pixel are read form the buffer, then they may are clamped to the range [0.0, 1.0].
This depends on the setting of [glClampColor (hyper-link)].
Read color clamping is controlled by calling
void ClampColor( enum target, enum clamp )
with target set to CLAMP_READ_COLOR.
If clamp is TRUE, read color clamping is enabled; if clamp is FALSE, read color clamping is disabled.
[...]
  For a floating-point RGBA color, if type is FLOAT or HALF_FLOAT, each component is clamped to [0, 1] if read color clamping is enabled.
Note, in OpenGL ES the colors are clamped  in any case.
[glGetTexImage (hyper-link)] is provided in desktop OpenGL only and doesn't clamp the colors.
In the editor, it isn't clamped.
When running, it is clamped.
Thus, thinking my math was wrong or I wasn't clamping correctly.
Clamping wouldn't do anything because it wouldn't notice anything about 0 becoming 360.
[Quaternion (hyper-link)] has four components, x, y, z, w and they all move in the range -1, 1 .. so your clamping is absolutely useless ;)
The reason is that clamp and relu produce different gradients at 0.
Checking with a scalar tensor x = 0 the two versions: (x.clamp(min=0) - 1.0).pow(2).backward() versus (relu(x) - 1.0).pow(2).backward().
The resulting x.grad is 0 for the relu version but it is -2 for the clamp version.
That means relu chooses x == 0 --> grad = 0 while clamp chooses x == 0 --> grad = 1.

That's a fine way to test a Clamp command, and is probably the best way to unit-test the logic of your #execute method.
But this starts to test Clamp itself, rather than your own code ... so I probably wouldn't bother.
In order to fix this, you must use self.clamp() when using it inside of the class that it is defined in.
Otherwise you must use v2.clamp() if you are calling it from outside of the class.
The reason it is saying global name 'clamp' is not defined is because it thinks that 'clamp' is supposed to be a variable,function, or class in the global scope such as:
You have a class CLamp, and a class CBulb.
so what does "CBulb *CLamp::ExchangeBulb(CBulb *theNewBulb)" mean?
It defines a member function of CLamp called ExchangeBulb that takes a pointer to CBulb and returns a pointer to CBulb
ExchangeBulb is a member function of CLamp.
also does this mean that *Clamp is an object of type CBulb?
ExchangeBulb is a member function of CLamp.It returns a pointer to CBulb class and takes a pointer to a CBulb as an argunent.
ExchangeBulb is a method in your CLamp class whose purpose is to take a new bulb and replace the old bulb.
ExchangeBulb is the member of CLamp.
ExchangeBulb is a function of CLamp.
also does this mean that *Clamp is an object of type CBulb?
I can't explain it but just to note that clamp resolves to max(MIN, min(VAL, MAX)) see [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp() (hyper-link)] and max and min demonstrate the same behaviour when the first parameter is 0 and the second has a unit.
If you look at the code, it has not done much but created /usr/local/clamp/ and then soft-linked /usr/local/clamp/clamp to  /usr/local/bin/clamp.
simd.clamp takes either, float2, float3, float4, double2, double3 or double4.
To use your func clamp(value:, min:, max:), call it this way :
Looking at the code toLonLat() applies a transform equivalent to transform(coordinate, 'EPSG:3857', 'EPSG:4326') and then clamps the Longitude.
With a function clamp functions defined like so (in your ~/.jq file or inline):
where clamp.jq contains:
the selected cells should be "clamped".
This is a trick I use for clamping an int to a 0 to 255 range:
As prelic said, then you are passing Clamp a string, when it needs a number.
The tricky part of this problem is determining which range to clamp to.
One approach is to find the nearest min/max bound to the value, then clamp according to the corresponding range.
Then, it's fairly easy to work backwards to determine which range the min/max value is from, and clamping accordingly:
a pure css method base on -webkit-line-clamp, it hide the origin "..." and use a custom div:
You might also prefer this way to clamp a value:
[Mathf.Clamp Documentation (hyper-link)]
use better css function "clamp":
Further, if your GPU uses OpenGL, you could of course just use the [clamp (hyper-link)] builtin directly:
Since you are executing it on the whole document, it will always get the first title that you appended to the document, and create many new MultiClamps on it.
The type that clamp returns is the common type of the arguments, it is not the type of the argument that is selected.
I think Clamp Angle will work for you better here I have some code.
Try using toClamp.height instead od toClamp.height().
So, in order for it to work, toClamp needs to somehow tell your program that it is a jQuery object.
The this keyword here, replaces toClamps
You are calling a jQuery method (.height()) on a DOM element (clamps[i]).
You're saying that toClamp has it's on height function but you haven't actually made the function.
You can partially apply clamp manually:
One way would be to use [functools.partial (hyper-link)] to create a clamping function with mixed limits, and then map that over the map object you get after the adding operation.
Another way would be to combine the adding and clamping into a single function.
In the code below I use a function make_add_clamp which returns a function that does the adding and clamping using the limits passed to make_add_clamp.
You can simply clamp it using a [Mathf.Min (hyper-link)].
OK I solved the problem, cropping it after clamping:
Image data is already a clamped array in js.
Its clamp() function ensures that a given color value is within bounds (0-255).
It clamps all values to between 0% and 100%, except saturate (where the maximum is 7500%), brightness and contrast (where the maximum is 200%), and hueRotate (where the values are wrapped around instead of clamped).
Because I use different filters, I ask if the filters name is 'CIColorClamp' and then I set the extent used in the CGImageRef to the values from the original image.
Given that x might be slightly outside [0,1] the second approach is not as easy as the first one due to clamping issues in UInt32-valuespace, ie every number in UInt32 is valid.
Single can't support enough accuracy to maintain the interim result, so you'll need to scale then clamp, but you can't clamp to UInt32.MaxValue because it can't be represented by single.
The maximum UInt32 you can safely clamp to is 4294967167
Because the multiplication to get from [0.0f .. 1.0f] to [0 .. UInt32.MaxValue] can itself be approximative, the order of operations that most obviously has the property you desire is multiply, then clamp, then round.
The maximum value to clamp to is the float immediately below 232, that is, 4294967040.0f.
You can also clamp to [0.0f .. 1.0f] if you do not multiply by too large a number afterwards, so that there is no risk of making the value larger than the largest float that can be converted:
You can then use actualAngle to clamp your rotation as I do above.
I think you shouldn't be using Uint8Array to store your data - it simply doesn't work like a Uint8ClampedArray.
I would just use a regular array (if that's an option) and clamp the values when you store them into it, or when you read them to generate your string like this:
The WhatWG has recommended the Uint8ClampedArray for storing canvas pixel data.
But, various browsers use Uint8ClampedArray (or not) depending on whether they've implemented the WhatWG recommendations.
So it might be better to have input modify the angles, clamp the body angle, and set them into the rotations.
If you want to completely freeze the axis instead of clamping it you should do something like
Use offsetHeight and scrollHeight when it gets line-clamped.
That is because clamp(), abs() and negation operation might be instruction modifiers on certain GPU platforms.
AFAIK, clamp() modifier is supported by all modern hardware.
Just apply LookAt, see the result and then clamp the result, applying the final rotation.
You need to use setClampingBounds using the Corona coordinates...
GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE prevents this wrapping behavior, and pixels won't blend with pixels from opposite side of texture.
Of course, once the result of the addition is converted to uint16_t when passed to clamp, it is guaranteed to be a uint16_t.
Passing std::numeric_limits::max() to clamp will mean that the input will not be clamped from the upper bound because it can never be greater than the limit.
To clamp the rotation, you can change your code to this:
1. glClampColor()'s only remaining function is clamping during glReadPixels.
Note that the FrontFace and ClampColor commands are not deprecated, as  they still affect other non-deprecated functionality; however, the
  ClampColor targets CLAMP_VERTEX_COLOR and CLAMP_FRAGMENT_COLOR are
  deprecated."
Clamping the vertex shader output did only make sense for the depracted builtin varyings like gl_FrontColor, gl_BackColor and so on.
With modern rendering approaches, the outputs aren't necessarily colors any more, but represent generic data, so implicitly clamping the values is harmful.
You always can manually clamp the values in the shader if you want to.
The shader outputs will only be clamped if the respective render target is of fixed-point or integer format.
If the color buffer is fixed-point, the components of the source and
  destination values and blend factors are each clamped to [0; 1] or
  [-1; 1] respectively for an unsigned normalized or signed normalized
  color buffer prior to evaluating the blend equation.
If the color
  buffer is floating-point, no clamping occurs.
The clamping of the blending result happens in the next step, which handles the optional sRGB conversion (however, the clamping step there is not tied to the sRGB conversion).
If the color buffer is fixed-point, each
  component is clamped to the range [0; 1] and then converted to a
  fixed-point value using equation 2.3.
So yes, when using a GL_RGBA32F framebuffer, no implicit clamping happens at all.
If you need some clamping to occur at step 3: just clamp the factors before you send them to glBlendFunc().
Simply use floating point textures: GL_RGBA16F, GL_RGBA32F, etc... they are not clamped
You can setup a float color  buffer by using the [GL_ARB_color_buffer_float (hyper-link)] extension: fragments are stored using a floating-point format, and the result can be clamped/unclamped by enabling/disabling the CLAMP_FRAGMENT_COLOR_ARB switch (using ClampColorARB).
Respect the [GL_ARB_texture_float (hyper-link)] extension, the GL_ARB_color_buffer_float allows the control of the clamping behavior of the fixed rendering pipeline (separating the vertex stage and the fragment stage).
Are floating-point values clamped for the fixed-function GL?
You need to disable color clamping:
using the clamp() method from ClosedInterval.
Also IE doesn’t support line-clamp [https://caniuse.com/?search=line-clamp (hyper-link)]  Try to avoid using -webkit-box and -webkit-box-orient, because these properties are non-standard
[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-flex (hyper-link)] [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-orient (hyper-link)]
Mathf.Clamp returns the clamped value and does not change the input as it's a call by value.
No, no, no, don't clamp.
Exactly what physical process do you think would correspond to clamping the light value?
The only time clamping should even come into play is if you are saving your final pixels to a non-HDR image format (e.g., 8 bit integer pixels) or displaying on a monitor.
And then, you should still consider some kind of tone mapping or smooth roll-off to simulate film response rather than a hard clamp.
After doing so, you will still need to clamp any values that remain greater than 1 (or whatever your maximum color value is).
You can use either technique I described for doing this: you can simply clamp anything outside the available range, or you can scale all the values by a fixed amount so that all the values fit into the range.
[Here (hyper-link)] is an example of clamping on the left and right with a horizontally centered image.
And not sure but I guess you also would have to clamp like
I'm also having problems with lwjgl/unclamped color/floating point framebuffers, but at least
for using glColor3f(2.0F, 1.0F, 1.0F) or such this seems to work (without framebuffers being
involved.)
However, as far as I can tell you don't actually have a floating point framebuffer in there, so what this code will do is carry out the color multiplication and then clamp it to [0F, 1F].
This is desired because anything else will be undisplayable, but if you do end up creating an unclamped float framebuffer then you'll need to use GL_RGBA16F as the format and GL_FLOAT as the data type.
Just make sure that your buffer you're rendering to is floating point, since fixed-only will only unclamp if your buffer is floating point - integer (unsigned byte to be precise) is the default.
Just to reiterate once more, however, you won't be able to actually find the outside-of-bounds color results by reading the main display buffer - it'll be clamped, however you'll be able to see the results.
Unfortunately There is no in-built function available same as clamp function.
but if you don't want to use CLAMP function then you can use IF statements.
but in my opinion Mathf.Clamp() is the best option for Restricting values in unity,if conditions will not be accurate as Mathf.Clamp() Function.
There is a similar function for Vectors: [Vector2.ClampMagnitude (hyper-link)] and [Vector3.ClampMagnitude (hyper-link)]
If you want to clamp a given position to a circle, you can slightly modify the version above.
Assuming angle is an integer, the difference is that your clamp code allows angles of exactly -360 or +360 degrees.
You must use [glClampColor (hyper-link)] to state whether the colors you read with glReadPixels will be clamped or not.
What gets written by the fragment shader will always be unclamped.
Do a full set of glClampColor() operations in your initGL() function:
On my system I only needed the GL_CLAMP_VERTEX_COLOR.
So clamping to +1 is unnecessary.
For both cases, clamping to 0 or to -1 should usually be unnecessary and might be a Bad Idea.
If you do want to interpolate the long way around, clamping to -1 is right.
Clamping the dot-product to zero will break things pretty badly.
So clamping to zero would be unnecessary.
There is no write clamping, and it's left to the user kernel code to ensure coordinates are valid.
No only is there no image write clamping, on some devices (e.g., older NVIDIA hardware), writing outside image bounds will crash in often hard-to-debug ways (since it's a GPU crash).
Taken from this site [http://developer.gnome.org/glib/2.34/glib-Standard-Macros.html#CLAMP:CAPS (hyper-link)]
Other suggested names instead of CLAMP can be VALUE_CONSTRAINED_LOW_HIGH, BOUNDS, CLIPPED.
In iOS 10, the UIColor class uses the extended sRGB color space and its initializers no longer clamp raw component values to between 0.0 and 1.0.
If your app relies on UIKit to clamp component values (whether you’re creating a color or asking a color for its component values), you need to change your app’s behavior when you link against iOS 10.
"Clamp[ing] raw component values to between 0.0 and 1.0" means that when you passed the old API a value below 0.0, it would use 0.0 instead, and when you passed the old API a value above 1.0 it would use 1.0 instead.
When using a reach profile, use power of two sized textures or set the TextureAddressingMode to Clamp.
If depth clamping (see section 13.5) is enabled, before the incoming fragment’s zw is compared, zw is clamped to the range [min(n; f ); max(n; f )]
In OpenGL values stored in framebuffers in float format are not clamped, you can store any value (but with a precision that is limited based on the format).
From: [https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/WEBGL_color_buffer_float/ (hyper-link)] "NOTE: fragment shaders outputs gl_FragColor and gl_FragData[0] will only be clamped and converted when the color buffer is fixed-point"
0-1000) then try rendering this texture to the screen by dividing by 1000, if your data is not clamped you should see the expected values, if it is clamped you will have loss of data.
Then Clamping the value, since the normalized position has been updated correctly.
You can collect the values from the clamped array, and initialize a new one like this however:
If enc is an Array of Uint8ClampedArrays, this one-liner statement should work:
unfortunately doesn’t return [1, 2, 3, 4] but [Uint8ClampedArray[4]].
firefox, nightly presently returns [[object Uint8ClampedArray],[object Uint8ClampedArray],[object Uint8ClampedArray]] at FileReader() result as pointed out by [@Oriol (hyper-link)].
If you look at the source code for [Clamped (hyper-link)], you'll see that it is just a wrapper around T.
You can then wrap slice_data in a new instance of Clamped, and pass it to ImageData:
To clamp a value you can use the Mathf.Clamp() method.
I think the easiest and most compatible way across browsers is to use [Clamp.js (hyper-link)].
It looks like the problem is that you update x and y, but then immediately after that you set them to something else with clamp().
Without knowing what clamp() does I can't say that that is for sure the issue, but it seems likely.
The general (unclamped) equation you want is:
For clamping, you can either clamp the output after you calculate the result:
Or you can clamp the input before you use it:
If the slope of the line does not change, and your clamping desires do not change, you can improve performance by pre-calculating it once and generating a function tailored to your input and needs:
Since most (on-die) algorithms for computing trigonometric functions use some variant of [CORDIC (hyper-link)], my bet is that those values are getting clamped within [0, Pi/2) anyway at the entry point of the trig function call.
This means for instance that if you are to add angles, and if by doing so, they can get large in magnitude, then you should consider periodically clamping them.
But it is unneccessary to clamp them just before the trigonometric function call.
An advantage of clamping angles to the range -pi/4 to pi/4 (use sine or cosine as appropriate) is that you can ensure that if the angles are computed using some approximation of pi, range reduction is performed using that same approximation.
It doesn't work the way you wrote it because there's no .every() on the Uint8ClampedArray prototype.
You could extend the prototype of Uint8ClampedArray with an every() function, which can be taken from the Array prototype; then your code will work fine.
You need to rewrite clamp for Euler angles because when you getting an angle from transform you always get a positive angle.
Set it to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE and it shouldn't happen anymore.
If you want to prevent the problem manually, you have to clamp to the range [0 + 1/texture_size, 1 - 1/texture_size].
I'm also not sure why you even clamp to [-1, 1], because texture coordinates usually range from [0, 1].
Then you won't get clamping.
Requires two clamp instead of one but I could not find any native way to achieve this.
Now all you need is P = ClampArray(P, -1, 1);.
Or, you could use Unity3D's [Mathf.clamp() (hyper-link)]:
You got your answer about clamping it but you really don't need to do this.
If you could usefully do whole vectors at a time, then you could use PMINSD/PMAXSD to clamp values to a signed range.
Clamping-needed case: One taken compare-and-branch uop, plus 3 more uops (lea, 1 for cmov, 1 more to jmp back.)
Obviously you can use jb instead of jae to skip over the clamping lea/cmov, instead of pulling them out of the main flow.
Its input operands were already needed, so it's not adding much latency even when clamping is needed.
An alternative branchy implementation of the .clamp code block that doesn't need a zeroed-register would be:
the no-clamping case), make that the fast-path through the code (as few instructions and as few taken-branches as possible).
Related code review: [Fastest way to clamp an integer to the range 0-255 (hyper-link)].
Also related, current clang pessimizes std::clamp into storing, selecting a pointer, and reloading.
TODO: file missed-optimization bug reports with this clamp peephole so compilers can look for it.
For now, I have versions that branchlessly clamp to [0, limit] (closed ranges at both ends, so to limit instead of limit-1.
If rax >=(unsigned) r12, the value definitely needs to be clamped, to either 0 or r12-1.
You are targetting the Reach profile, so either all your texture dimensions must be powers of two or you have to use clamp as adress mode.
If you don't need wrapping, try replacing SamplerState.LinearWrap with SamplerState.LinearClamp in your Statics.SPRITEBATCH.Begin call.
Here is the link: 
[https://stackblitz.com/edit/sidenav-content-clamp-issue (hyper-link)]
You probably wanted to do: float rotationX = Mathf.Clamp(transform.localEulerAngles.x, -45.0f, 45.0f);
Now, assume that we have an open uniform cubic B-spline instead of a clamped one.
Finally, if we want to draw clamped B-splines instead of open B-splines, we simply have to repeat both endpoints of the clamped B-spline three more times:
[SamplerState.AnisotropicClamp (hyper-link)]
Contains default state for anisotropic filtering and texture
  coordinate clamping.
The answer is that you have to tell the device what the correct way is, by specifying either WRAP or CLAMP sampler states.
A CLAMP state clamps the texture coordinates to the [0, 1] range; pixels with coordinates outside of this range will display the closest valid texel.
After reading your comments below, the clamp() usage is part of the problem for the text taking up so much space on the screen and forcing the #chat_bubble to have a large height.
The syntax is clamp(min, flex unit, max) and your using 1.5rem for the 2nd arg, instead use a viewport unit like 3vw or anything with vw as the middle argument which is the "scale" or "flex-unit" so to speak.
This would allow the caller to pass in anything that clamp() can call using cmp(param1, param2) - which can include:
The problem comes from the combination of GL_LINEAR and GL_CLAMP_TO_BORDER:
Clamp to border means that every texture coordinate outside of [0, 1]
will return the border color.
If you don't want this behavior, the simplest solution would be to use GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE instead which will repeat the last row/column of texels to infinity.
