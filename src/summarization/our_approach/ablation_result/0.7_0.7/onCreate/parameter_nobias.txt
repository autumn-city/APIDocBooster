In the database file, the version number is stored in [PRAGMA user_version (hyper-link)]. 
If onCreate() returns successfully (doesn't throw an exception), the database is assumed to be created with the requested version number. 
So when the database helper constructor is called with a name (2nd param), platform checks if the database exists or not and if the database exists, it gets the version information from the database file header and triggers the right call back 
When we create DataBase at a first time (i.e Database is not exists) onCreate() create database with version which is passed in  SQLiteOpenHelper(Context context, String name, SQLiteDatabase.CursorFactory factory, int version)
