Note that onCreate() is only invoked when the database file didn't exist so the DROP TABLE is really not needed. 
 If the database already exists, but I've indicated through the database version value that I'm changing the version, that is that I've incremented it, then the onUpgrade method will be called. 
 In the onCreate method, you should add code that creates your database tables and if you like, you can also add code to add data. 
 I'll call the onCreate method. 
For what it's worth, it's also a bad idea to catch exceptions in onCreate().  If the method returns successfully (doesn't throw), the framework thinks the database was created successfully.
