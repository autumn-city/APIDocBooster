dorkmo: you guys ever seen that movie mercury rising?
Klingenwetzer: no :3
UzeezU: I think you can learn a tremendous amount. One thing that is hard about math though if for any given topic there are hundreds of books that are hundreds of pages and all at various lelels. I wish there were more consdensed versions of the materials where it focusing on just learning the core of the subject and the most transferable infromation. Just read these 50 pages and you know the core ideas and frequent uses of this branch of math would be ideal.
jrrbls: @Klingenwetzer it's practice for sure but you can have a certain inclination for doing that practice in the first place
imaginenation: actually it doesnt matter if those numbers are prime or not you just need the cardinality or the quantity of fixed things

garam_chai94: what's the problem statement?
timbo7io: A set of disks numbered 1 through 100 are placed in a line in random order. What is the probability that we have a partial derangement such that exactly 22 prime number discs are found away from their natural positions? (Any number of non-prime disks may also be found in or out of their natural positions.) Give your answer rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point in the form 0.abcdefghijkl.
bulbaz0r: are you looking for total number of partial derangements possible?
geohot_pls_fck_me: still warm up ?
Jeppelelle: lul that nick
timbo7io: i still need to look up what a derangements is hehe
Cluwe: the hypergeometric distribution describes the probability of k successes (random draws for which the object drawn has a specified feature) in n draws, without replacement, from a finite population of size N that contains exactly K objects with that feature, wherein each draw is either a success or a failure.
timbo7io: we need to substract

maxminos: no clue
maxminos: we dont know math
th3_maj0r: https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges/euler239/problem
imaginenation: aah
imaginenation: i dont know math either
imaginenation: i just google
maxminos: he should copyand paste an existing subfact function
averagesizepens: 20
PhearTheCeal: @th3_maj0r what is P and Q in the problem description?
giorgostheo97: Po ta to , ma ths
Blobiciously: p and q means a and b
imaginenation: you see subfactorial is basically the number of derangements which is approximately factorial(n) divided by constant e rounded to nearest integer
maxminos: vectorization of a and b
maxminos: okay
averagesizepens: WRONG
maxminos: what are derangements
Blobiciously: google them
imshafay: Mathematical function, suitable for both symbolic and numerical manipulation. For noninteger n, the numerical value of Subfactorial[n] is given by Gamma[n 1,-1]/E. Subfactorial can be evaluated to arbitrary numerical precision. A permutation in which no object appears in its natural place is called a derangement. Subfactorial automatically threads over lists. Subfactorial[0] gives 1
maxminos: tldr
kektobiologist: LUL
menchedanem: all f***n days
imaginenation: derangemetns are basically how many different ways can you arrange things such that none of them are in their original positions
averagesizepens: derangements are numbers that would commit mass murdering in a school
imaginenation: you see subfactorial is basically the number of derangements which is approximately factorial(n) divided by constant e rounded to nearest integer

maxminos: it's a limit
maxminos: i dont
imaginenation: include exclusion include exclusion include exclusion

maxminos: right after he solves this problem
saulgd: what kind of spongy ass keyboard is he using
joker2k999: prolly next time he lights up a bowl
maxminos: the latter, just to make you feel better
averagesizepens: weed didnt help forsure
gordovolador: or both
imaginenation: if you smoked weed before 25 which is the age for full brain development then defenitely that is what made you stupid
kratosboii: true

perfectjustlikeme: VERY deep in thought
Shahin8520: why GO should be better ?
janchomath: write some more pragmas
alfyfav: How much tiem has geo be coding this?
Chi_Nar: They might have arguments that no code optimization
myaocat: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derangement
samtheprogram: switch to go
alfyfav: time*
tybutnowyoudie: @Shahin8520 because the time limit is higher
TheZombieKillerWhale: @Shahin8520 hackerrank gives more time for Go
Chi_Nar: have you tried #pragma omp for
Merwanedr: watching geohot on windows makes me depressive
gigafact: 6h
janchomath: #pragma GCC optimization ("unroll-loops")
averagesizepens: just ctrl w and done

BeNiceChat: for (int i=n; i--;) :)
christian__james: @Merwanedr yeah me2
bhad: this is easier then installing arch linux

revolutionist123: remove if and put i =2
abstractingagent: damn man - almost 700 people in this bitch
timbo7io: i ran out of wine
josergdev: the tests possibly are randomly genereated
bhad: just spam submit code, and wait for their computers to speed themselves up
perfectjustlikeme: Use more ternary ? ‚ÄúNah‚Äù : ‚Äúfuk yas‚Äù

lennyerik: maybe write some stuff in inline assembly (if at all possible)?
Klingenwetzer: remove the upper half of the search area for isPrime
jagger_rsw: isn't power() slow because u use slow % with 1000..123 which cannot be optimized instead of val&0xff..ff mask ?
Chi_Nar: sieve of Eratosthenes untilo n
TheZombieKillerWhale: time to switch to Go
jkpfeffer: @georgehotz The answer is the same for any set of (25-22) numbers! You don't need any prime code.
Azermite: vectorization instead of for loops
Equalizer_olo: Any Russian?
insanebaba: @myaocat thank you
