Note that onCreate() is only invoked when the database file didn't exist so the DROP TABLE is really not needed. 
 And then that query you have to execute inside the callback method onCreate, which you have to override once you extend a class with the SQLiteOpenHelper class.  So that query you have to execute inside the onCreate.  Either you can execute it directly-- you can put the whole query directly inside a db.exeSQL. 
 And inside the SQLiteOpenHelper class, I will be putting a database-- I will be creating that whole structure.  There will be onCreate, there will be onUpgrade, insert query will be there, and update, delete-- all those queries will be there inside one class.  That will be the subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper class. 
 If the database already exists, but I've indicated through the database version value that I'm changing the version, that is that I've incremented it, then the onUpgrade method will be called. 
 Then once I've dropped the table, in order to recreate it, I'll simply call my onCreate method.  This is the one exception to what I just said that I wouldn't call the onCreate method directly.
