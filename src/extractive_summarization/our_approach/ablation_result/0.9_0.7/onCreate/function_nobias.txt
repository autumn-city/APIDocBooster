 onCreate is responsible for creating your tables inside your SQLite database, and onUpgrade will be responsible for upgrading your database if you do make any changes. 
onCreate() is called when you call getWritableDatabase() or getReadableDatabase() on the helper and the database file does not exist.  If the file is already there and the version number is the requested one, no callback such as onCreate() is invoked.
onCreate() is only run when the database file did not exist and was just created. 
onCreate will be invoked only when getWritableDatabase() or getReadableDatabase() is executed.  And this will only invoked once when a DBName specified in the first step is not available.
