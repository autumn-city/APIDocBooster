i get asked these two questions multiple times a 
day how can i start in machine learning and how  
can i follow the news in ai the first one takes 
multiple forms such as how can i start for free  
how can i start if i don't have a developer 
background or how can i start without any math  
etc so i decided to do this video to answer them 
once and for all of course since i will share  
many resources i also wrote a complete guide 
on how to start in machine learning in 2021  
from no background at all and for free as well 
as a github repository with all the useful links  
it is linked in the description below because 
of these pertinent questions i've researched a  
lot of resources online and i saved the best 
ones on a notepad over the past two years to  
quickly answer the next upcoming questions today 
i will share this notepad with everyone and list  
many great resources and give you some of my 
personal tips on how to learn and improve your  
machine learning skills and how do i stay up to 
date with all the news in the field oh and please  
let me know in the comments if you know any other 
great resources that i could add to this guide  
to make this learning process easier and better 
for everyone since this video is a bit special  
here are some important timestamps you can skip 
to if you'd like more information about a specific  
subject otherwise i will go through this guide 
and show you how you can develop great machine  
learning skills without wasting money following 
your own needs one last thing if you are here  
to know how to stay up to date with the news in 
the field and learn about the new techniques you  
should consider subscribing to my channel since 
i share exactly this type of content every week  
this guide is intended for anyone having zero or 
a small background in programming mathematics or  
machine learning this is why i will list resources 
for all these subjects but feel free to go at your  
pace and learn what you want to learn also there 
is no specific order to follow here i mainly  
listed them the way i will do it but feel free 
to start with whatever you feel you like the most  
final little note before sharing these tips with 
you it is super important do what you want to do  
if you don't like reading books skip the section 
if you don't want to follow an online course you  
can skip this one as well same thing for videos 
there is not a single way to become a machine  
learning expert and with motivation you can 
absolutely achieve it by creating your own path  
oh and don't be afraid or ashamed to replay videos 
or learn the same concepts from multiple sources  
repetition is the key to success in learning 
something new now let's dive right into it this  
section is mainly for complete beginners in my 
opinion the best way to start learning anything  
is with short videos on youtube and this field 
is no exception there are thousands of amazing  
videos and playlists that teach important concepts 
of machine learning for free on this platform and  
you should take advantage of them here i recommend 
two playlists to watch they will give you a great  
first introduction to the terms you need to know 
to get started in the field the first one is my  
own playlist where i explain the most used terms 
in the field which can be very helpful if you are  
just starting and then i'd suggest to dive a 
little deeper into the foundations of machine  
learning and deep learning and learn more about 
neural networks understanding neural networks and  
back propagation is the most important thing when 
starting and gives you an enormous advantage when  
you dive into more advanced lectures and courses 
for this i will recommend the great playlist made  
by 3 blue 1 brown now that you have a good basis 
of what a machine learning algorithm is how it  
works and how it learned using backpropagation you 
are ready to dive even deeper with more complete  
and advanced courses this step is a little longer 
since you will be watching many hours of free  
amazing courses on youtube and learn a lot from 
them please do not watch these courses while doing  
something else they are great resources that need 
concentration taking notes and asking questions  
through online communities as i will talk later 
in the video here i share three courses that i  
followed and loved personally which are the ones 
from mit stanford and andrew angie again i just  
want to remind you that all the links are in the 
repository linked in the description below so  
you don't have to note them down right away as 
it has been proven multiple times humans learn  
better by repeating and learning in different ways 
such as hearing writing reading watching and etc  
this is why it's as important to read as to watch 
videos for a better understanding you will cover  
many angles and have a more complete view of what 
you are trying to learn this section is a list  
of short articles and books that are completely 
free and optional if you are into reading i will  
suggest starting with these five short articles 
and then jump into the more advanced books books  
are a great way to learn at your rhythm be sure to 
understand everything before going into practice  
mode the final theoretical subject to cover here 
is the mathematics behind machine learning which  
are extremely important you can always just 
apply machine learning algorithms and tweak  
it until it works but you will never understand 
it correctly and improve it following this path  
if you have zero background in math don't worry 
just like most things in life you can learn  
math unfortunately for us there's an awesome 
website called can academy where you can learn  
many mathematics concepts all for free here are 
some great beginner and advanced resources to get  
into the machine learning map i also listed some 
great videos and free books you can check as well  
more is better i will also suggest starting 
with these three very important concepts in  
machine learning linear algebra probability and 
multivariable calculus which are the three courses  
i suggested of course if some subjects covered 
here are already a bit too advanced for you  
you can always look to complement these with 
other courses or books this section is for  
beginners in coding if you have no background at 
all in python or any other programming language  
this will get you starting and give you an 
awesome basis for machine learning programming  
if you are already pretty familiar with 
python you can skip to the next step  
here i list the best online courses to learn 
the programming side of machine learning  
using python and have a great background but you 
can always decide to learn with another language  
for sure now that you have a good understanding 
of the theory behind machine learning and a  
coding background you are ready to start your way 
into machine learning courses of course these are  
all optional here the first one is free and the 
other ones are paying since they will teach you  
many things and some even give you certifications 
you can use in your resume if you don't want to  
follow any courses you can jump to the next 
section and start to practice on your own  
it will be a little more difficult at first but 
with great googling skills and motivation you  
will be able to do this for sure otherwise if 
you prefer to have clear steps to follow these  
courses are the best ones to do starting from 
the basics to more advanced from top to bottom  
practice practice and practice the most important 
thing in programming is practice and this applies  
to machine learning too it can be hard to find a 
personal project to practice on but fortunately  
for us kaggle exists this website is full of free 
courses tutorials and competitions you can join  
competitions for free and just download their 
data read about their problem and start coding  
and testing right away you can even earn money 
from winning competitions and it is a great thing  
to have on your resume as well this may be the 
best way to get experience while learning a lot  
and even earn money you can also create teams 
for kaggle competition and learn with people i  
definitely suggest you to join a community to find 
a team and learn with others it is always better  
than learning alone the following section is 
devoted to this indeed most of the time the best  
way to learn is to learn with someone else join 
online communities and find partners to learn with  
this is the reason why i created a discord 
server a year ago with the goal of getting many  
ai enthusiasts and learn together ask questions 
find kaggle team mates share your projects and  
much more it is called learn ai together we are 
already more than 8 000 people in not even a year  
i will be glad to see you there and please reach 
out to me if you do you can also follow reddit  
communities where you can ask questions share 
your projects follow news in the field and more  
here i list the most popular ones that i follow 
on a daily basis finally i will recommend you to  
save cheat sheets on your computer tablet or even 
print them they are a very good way to compress  
information and have it all at hand here 
i list the best cheat sheets i could find  
and as i just said even if you are advanced you 
should definitely have them printed somewhere  
near your desk now another important thing in 
this field is to stay up to date with the new  
upcoming papers and new applications that 
are released every single day a great way  
is to join linkedin and facebook groups that are 
sharing these new applications you can also follow  
medium publications and youtube channels that are 
summarizing these new papers of course you are  
already at a pretty good place for this since i 
personally do share news related to ai every week  
so you should definitely subscribe and turn on 
the notifications to not miss any future videos  
newsletters are also a great way to have all the 
news condensed at one place every day or week  
here i list a few of the best ones i know that i 
personally use in my day to day life but you can  
surely search for more in your fields of interest 
note that this is a non-existent list of resources  
you can definitely use more or less resources and 
learn at your rhythm you must follow your instinct  
to find the best way you can learn don't ever 
feel guilty about replaying a video or reading  
an article twice to understand a concept we've 
all been through this and it is perfectly normal  
the most important thing is that you understand 
the concept and not that you go through the list  
as quickly as possible let me know in the comments 
if you know any other great resources that i could  
add to this guide to make this learning process 
easier and better for everyone please leave a like  
if you went this far in the video and since there 
are over 80 of you guys that are not subscribed  
yet please consider subscribing to the channel to 
not miss any further news thank you for watching
