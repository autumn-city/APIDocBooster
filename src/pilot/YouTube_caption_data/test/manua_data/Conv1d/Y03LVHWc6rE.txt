in this video we're going to talk about the 
convolve operator in details i mean step by step  
and we are going to do all the calculations by 
hand and then we are going to study that in python  
programming language using the numpy package so 
please stay tuned so first of all suppose that we  
have two vectors vector one and vector two and 
we want to convolve these two vectors together  
and maybe you ask what is the meaning of 
convolve operator in order to understand  
what is the meaning of convolve operator you 
should wait a minute because we are going to  
study an example and after that example you 
will find out the meaning of convolve operator  
so here we have a vector vector one which is a red 
vector and also we have a black vector and we want  
to convolve these together the general idea of 
the convolve operator in this example which is  
a one-dimensional and discrete convolve operator 
so in this example the general idea is sliding  
this vector from left to right and multiplying 
each values and maybe you ask what is the meaning  
again you should wait a minute because after 
the example you will find out the meaning  
so let's start and as you can see there is no 
values in these places so we cannot multiply  
one divided by 3 by this value and one divided by 
3 by this value because there is no value but here  
we have a value so we multiply 10 by 1 divided by 
3 which leads to 10 divided by 3 and let's write  
it beside the page as you can see 10 divided 
by 3 and also let's append that to a list this  
list is going to represent the values of different 
steps this is step number one and the value is 10  
divided by 3. so let's go to the next step which 
we are going to slide this vector to the right  
we are going to slide this vector one block to 
the right and now in this step as you can see  
we don't have such value here but we have values 
here so 10 times 1 divided by 3 is 10 divided by  
3 and also 11 times 1 divided by 3 is 11 divided 
by 3. and if you sum these values you will get  
21 divided by 3 and you append that to the list 
so this is the value for the first step and this  
is the value for the current step which is step 
number two and now let's again slide this vector  
to the right one block to the right as you can see 
here we can multiply each values so 10 divided by  
3 11 divided by 3 12 divided by 3 and if you sum 
these values you will get 33 divided by 3 and we  
append that to that list and again let's slide it 
to the right again so now we are going to multiply  
11 divided by 3 12 divided by 3 5 divided by 3 and 
if you sum these values you will get 28 divided by  
3 and we are going to append that to the list 
and again we are going to slide this vector to  
the right so we are going to multiply values and 
this is the summation of these values and we are  
going to append that to the list and also again 
we are going to do the same for the rest so as you  
can see this is the final result the final result 
of sliding that red vector and multiplying values  
and if you do the calculations this is the final 
result 10 divided by 3 is equal to 3.3 21 divided  
by 3 equals to 7, 33 divided by 3 is 11 and etc 
so this is the convolve operator and remember  
that the convolve operator has different modes and 
the thing that we have talked so far is the "full"  
mode i mean we are calculating all the possible 
cases so we are sliding this vector to the right  
and we are calculating all the possible cases 
but there is another mode called "valid" which  
for example this case is not valid for this mode 
why because in this case we don't have such values  
of course in the full mode there is no problem and 
you can do the calculations but in the valid mode  
this case is not allowed because you don't have 
two values in order to multiply so remember that  
this case is allowed in the full mode but not 
in the valid mode in the valid mode it is going  
to start from this case which you can see you can 
multiply all the values together so in the valid  
mode you're going to start from this case and 
you're going to multiply these two values and then  
you're going to slide to the right slide to the 
right slide to the right and slide to the right  
and this is the final case which you are allowed 
in the valid mode you cannot shift anymore because  
that is not going to be valid and if you do the 
calculations you will get these values for sliding  
the red vector to the right and now let's do all 
the calculations in python programming language  
using the numpy package so first of all we import 
numpy as np then we define two vectors vector one  
and vector two vector one is the one divided by 
three one divided by three one divided by three  
and vector two is the numbers so we have defined 
two vectors vector one and vector two and we want  
to convolve these two vectors together and now 
we simply type np dot convolve because you want  
to convolve these two vectors so we are going 
to pass vector one which is our first vector  
then vector two which is the second vector and 
for example suppose that we want to calculate  
the full convolution so we are going to pass 
mode equals to full and for example we store  
the results in a variable let's say called result 
and if you print the results variable the result  
variable and if i run the code and now we can see 
here is the result which is exactly the same to  
those things we have seen in these slides 
and now let's convolve these two vectors  
with the valid mode so i should pass valid 
and if i run the code you can see here is  
the result which is again exactly the same 
to those things we have seen in the slides
