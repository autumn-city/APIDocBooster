And we can actually use both on either the  LSTM or the LSTM cell for implementing the character RNN.
The vectorize sequence of notes will be input into the first LSTM cell.
In case the hidden state was None or in other words if this is the first time we run the forward pass we populate both of the hidden states by zeros.
Custom LSTMCells don't support GPU acceleration capabilities - this statement probably means GPU acceleration capabilities become limited if you use LSTMCells.
Obviously, It is easier to apply parallel computing in LSTM.
