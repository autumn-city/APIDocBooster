recursive_x: "fighters of entropy"
insignia_microwave: @bhargavannem hes talked about this he thinks there good but they will never ship. now let's stay more on topic here please
recursive_x: flaws
ThatGuyChaos: @bernardkelley No I meant the article not the stream
dorkmo: money manager moving money
krystalgamer: universities can be considered group 1
XO_Khaos: executive assistant quality facilitator
foti_kasparov: So network specialist who fixes routers and modems are group 3?
krystalgamer: expensive daycare
kebabmuncher23: hello
Plurmorant: omg im MOOOOVING

goodie2shoess: not suprised
budu_baka_ryu: What about govt workers
kebabmuncher23: money isnt even real
arbitrandomuser: we need a "george what do you think about " FAQ
jkfsda: just joined, what is group 1?
ck1956: looks legit George
wjejjekekwksksnebs: Pisses me off how many fucking business majors there are. 1/5 students in any given college are business majors
Svr123456789: Hey George !
mattikaldi: my thought aswell
krystalgamer: automating teaching is hard, specially early ages
bernardkelley: have an separate rail road / road specifically for ai trucks ?
OPPlE: Can you automate everything around truck-driving though? It's more than going from point A to point B
IncognitoJam: Can you automate academics though
yunidoo: is it also ~70% group 1 jobs historically?
krystalgamer: later ages it's just fine
JohnnyThe_Hobo: workers of the world, unite
DeeboMC: Martin Shkreli‚Äôs gonna be featured on an episode of American Greed this upcoming Monday night @georgehotz
W1lkins: @Georgehotz What ratio of group 1/2/3 do you think is optimal?

JohnnyThe_Hobo: @DeeboMC is he out? PogChamp
robotboy987: you should also include comparison of groups vs developed/undeveloped countries
ck1956: 1B is an assault on society
Lefer_: Agree with George fully on this
purgatoires: This feels far too simplistic, like u can‚Äôt just assume that services are inherently different from material goods
goodie2shoess: MBA: Mind blowing Assholes
KeyLogan_: Management of large organizations is important though in my opinion..
humbleservent: no teachers can't be replaced, if two kids fight, who would judge who is right, who is wrong?
syukaan1: oh i was thinking of backpage my bad @georgehotz
krystalgamer: @humbleservent teachers shouldn't pick sides
qislar: !uptime
bernardkelley: @qislar 17 minutes brother
carlosdanker: sup sup sup geohotzers
generated_human: E-mail blogposts for subs only?
CortezxTheKiller: CortezxTheKiller subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
mexeroserisback: yeah teaching involves too much socializing - society will reject the idea of automating it. The more social the job the longer it will take e.g. waiters are there not to move stuff but to interact with guests
audendana: @georgehotz how do you feel about the mathematical universe hypothesis https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0646.pdf
DeeboMC: @johnnythe_hobo I‚Äôm not sure, I haven‚Äôt really been following him, I just knew George did lol
AlfaAnanasz: when will you publish this?
IncognitoJam: @humbleservent that doesn't sound like a teacher job, like who says kids even need to be together to be taught
budu_baka_ryu: What is the algo complexity of algos and data science beating markets
gigafact: how people have meaning if they have no job? That is the problem maybe...
bhavc: yes pls
W1lkins: 20/60/20 split for group 1/2/3 optimal? @georgehotz
humbleservent: @krystalgamer yes they should, they should support good and teach the bad
bhargavannem: @georgehotz do u use pytorch for comma.ai's machine learning
purgatoires: If all u care about is survival yea
recursive_x: you're just destroying the means to an end while producing means to live
bhavc: make a substack, its the only thing im reading
wxrlss_: What do you think is the optimal ratio of 1/2/3?
Faiir1337: Doesn't that management stuff has to do with organization theory? But I agree american middle management seems kinda bloated
me2m8: how would you classify something like technical support? also entropy fighter, ye?
yunidoo: are you perhaps oversimplifying to just needs, whereas people actually have a lot of wants and give them irrationally more attention than they should
IceHegel: Martin Heidegger

sehuva_kapp123: yes
HaVoCPanda69: there is a lot of moving in china
PeinlicherAffe: Jebaited
bhargavannem: @georgehotz do u use pytorch for comma.ai's machine learning
IncognitoJam: worldometers time
wxrlss_: So what do you think is the optimal ratio of 1/2/3?
bernardkelley: @bhargavannem he is not going to answer that. Stop for now
CoachMeech: obviously it isn't the responsibility of those who create new wealth, such as automating truck driving, to think about "well what about the workers reee". but do you support someting like UBI to make sure that new wealth especially from automation would be evenly increase quality of life throughout society and not just let like 500 people live in a closed neighborhood?
humbleservent: @IncognitoJam what? kids don't need to be together? how would teach kids to be social and dont be a bot always behind a dumb machine?
bernardkelley: @bhargavannem ask later
dorkmo: mining is basically a mover?
FMIKO: can i get a wahoo George
kebabmuncher23: wahoo
kamtb28: Does group 3 also try to make group 1 more efficient?
SlaterUSA: did we accidentally libertarian?
wjejjekekwksksnebs: Probably not. China has a lot more focus on science and engineering.
mexeroserisback: @georgehotz split movers into social and non social ones
icyvran: An object in a point A has a different value on point B
bhargavannem: @georgehotz do u use pytorch for comma.ai's machine learning
IceHegel: high share of group 1 == decadence
ck1956: Also a good proportion left out on article would be small business owners managed by mostly small families
AlfaAnanasz: so what the fuck is your point LUL
recursive_x: its destroying human capital or value but whatever
robotboy987: what about the "entertainment sector" like actors etc, which group they are included
Juxtapo8: so why is truck driver arbitrage "better" than a manager guiding a team of skilled individuals into creating a new product?
KagedKhaos: crypto arbitrage?
recursive_x: any automation will require maintenance
SlaterUSA: where do the guillotines come in @georgehotz ?
thecoder15: Could you link what he is reading and your blog @georgehotz
ishakd00: optimal ratio is almost nobody having to do any work
DeeboMC: Can you breakdown value comparison between Zuckerberg and Bezos? @georgehotz
yunidoo: @georgehotz many of the movers would become manufacturers and maintainers of the robots that took their jobs, perhaps all of them since the massive influx of different kinds of robots may require many people to mf/maintain
daithi91: Is group 3 effectively moving people from group 2 to group 1?
IncognitoJam: @humbleservent but that isn't inherent to teaching, that's just the daycare thing, the teacher's job can be automated with elearning
wxrlss_: What do you think is the optimal ratio of 1/2/3?
recursive_x: just retrofit the Oregon trail
wjejjekekwksksnebs: Group 3 isn‚Äôt trying to make group 1 more efficient. They‚Äôre trying to (maybe not knowingly) replace them
gigafact: how to automate repairs or anything
me2m8: can we get a link?
purgatoires: It‚Äôs almost as if these things are measured in currency
qislar: how how many wood can a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood
searchingforlife: how optimal is optimal?
adroniser: It's interesting that there's the expectation that it's optimal for everyone to be working. Why should we keep jobs around that can be automated if automating them is better for society.
thecoder15: Free market makes it optimal to a on a long enough time scale theoretically
krystalgamer: @searchingforlife meta-physics question
PeinlicherAffe: @qislar ask you local lumberjack
robotboy987: it would be amazing to see this vs gdp correlation
yunidoo: @georgehotz what was the share of group 1 jobs, say, 50 years ago? Is it far less than 73%?
Exclamation_mark_CODE: screenshotted Kappa
bernardkelley: LIQUID PogChamp
ahahaitslit: macro econ 101 is bs

Joooooooooonas: We really need some commands with nightbot or smth like this
sjxf: is the singularity he is referring to some accelerationist shit?
teayoflow: Higher res than 1080p I'm guessing @Xaotic
anguscupcake: no, it's the tech singularity
ck1956: merge (x:xs) (y:ys) = x : y : merge xs ys
Xaotic: @teayoflow I also have a mbp 15 inch however this would be really impossible to see

recursive_x: which wouldn't should both arguments
CoachMeech: Sicp
krystalgamer: refinement types do seem interesting, dunno about real world application use cases though
Mieer: @DeeboMC ``I had a legit question.. no trolling
adroniser: @HaVoCPanda69 That just makes the chat bigger
anguscupcake: SICP is pretty good except at some points you have to ask wtf is the author trying to say
sjxf: @anguscupcake yo what is a tech singularity?
testiculo69: ALTO GENIO GEORGEEEEE
IbisGaming: does anyone know if he even prepared a test?
recursive_x: experience simulator
HaVoCPanda69: @adroniser must be different for me ü§∑‚ôÇÔ∏è
aijs: no, he didn't prepare any test
adroniser: Actually 125% makes it better thanks @HaVoCPanda69
recursive_x: why learn y of x
IbisGaming: thank you, @aijs
recursive_x: if y of x is dependent on x
DasMastah: Like tests, but generic instead of specific
shoraibit: interested
39BiggusDikus: is this live
anguscupcake: @sjxf u gotta google it
adroniser: Most likely the question was kinda dumb. Like asking "what are your thoughts on the singularity?"
shoraibit: similar to formal verification?
colanzio5: kinda like the purpose of a comparison function for prio queue in oo langs?
r3mote: Hello =)

protectionfromblue: @georgehotz streamlabs has auto-mod and other stuff
tux6: hello!
bichid69: wait am I a 3m follower?
nikudino: !followage
recursive_x: lpp
luspr: @georgehotz LiquidHaskell? Is this work for backspace.ai ?
vHyphy: geohot
brickeyy: monkaS
EhGuyInCanada: RIP to the subs who aren‚Äôt 3-month followers
smurfd0: https://www.techjunkie.com/blacklist-ban-words-twitch/
bichid69: oh, I am
rewia_: https://dashboard.twitch.tv/u/georgehotz/settings/moderation/blocked-terms
carterjfulcher: l
Joooooooooonas: @georgehotz take some time off stream and get nightbot
recursive_x: haha
lithiumx4900: We need a chat social ranking like they do in China, but based on George's IQ tests.
gigafact: all this bots are trash
EhGuyInCanada: @ced0xf are you still here?
Bo0sted05: go into moderator view, click the sword in the bottom right hand side of chat
georgecoldz: helo
luspr: Geohot heuristic: pretty website -> lies
ced0xF: @EhGuyInCanada yes
insignia_microwave: I think the problem is the people here are young and don't understand what your doing so they just talk about other more simple things.
girtss3: Did you get partner?
sureom: wait monads!!!
ced0xF: Great book, the video lectures are good too
jkfsda: Bartosz Milewski is great
adroniser: Category theory is cool for basically not having to repeat yourself 1000 times when developing abstract algebra
vHyphy: Nice
Daniel_Duan: Bartosz Kreygasm
otsukaranz: hi, im a n00b
K1ngjulien_: oh damn, the m-word
bichid69: lmao this looks entertaining
jkfsda: monads are burritos
lambdaman0f: bartosz is the best
joaovictorsnt: hehe this is interesting
vHyphy: Show code
K1ngjulien_: i think you can have years of functional programming experience and still dont get what a monad is
bigie: i didn't have this stuff in my bachelor's and now i don't know what to sift through
lowtemperaturebody: hello guys, what are we inventing today?
jkfsda: @K1ngjulien_ speaking from experience?
K1ngjulien_: kinda
recursive_x: start and end memory addresses lop
czz78_: can you put bigger text on vim?
EhGuyInCanada: @bigie you didn‚Äôt have what?
girtss3: Learn you a haskell explains monads pretty well
anguscupcake: I don't get those monads with multiple functions
TusKaN_BaNaNas: oh yeah friday night schemin
vHyphy: Can you turn that into a function
bigie: @EhGuyInCanada some of the "core" CS stuff like functional programming. my degree was more focused on embedded programming
badpartyhouse: Cheer10
Vjasal: hello best programmer in the whole world
xJuanchoVillax: xJuanchoVillax subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
sevaric: I feel like LYAH does a much better job of explaining how to use a monad rather than how and why it works.
zonderval: if you would have to explain haskel in one sentence, how would you do it?
badpartyhouse: Cheer1
vHyphy: Is Haskell like like R?
EhGuyInCanada: @bigie most CS bachelor‚Äôs programs these days don‚Äôt really teach functional programming
badpartyhouse: Cheer1
badpartyhouse: Cheer1
badpartyhouse: Cheer1
badpartyhouse: Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1
otsukaranz: is it a kind of dog?
badpartyhouse: Cheer100
bichid69: rust sucks, it's waay overhyped
TusKaN_BaNaNas: I was taught functional programming for a single week (so like two classes) in my algorithms course
wraith_: disagee
badpartyhouse: Cheer100 whats your vim set up?
vHyphy: @ehguyincanada you learn functional programming in the US with a data science undergrad
xJuanchoVillax: cheer train, woohoo
lenindeluna: lenindeluna subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
K1ngjulien_: if rust can prevend 70% of all CVEs its totally worth it
sevaric: I feel like Rust is more for the OCaml crowd than the Haskell crowd.
gigafact: HYPE train
bigie: @EhGuyInCanada yep
sureom: Pog
EhGuyInCanada: Well I go to UChicago, where functional programming is taught, and the vibe there is that it isn‚Äôt really taught as much at other universities
anguscupcake: I had a single class on ML
joaovictorsnt: what a music hum ?
proton1107: Haskell was the first programming language I was taught in Uni
brickeyy: SourPls
TusKaN_BaNaNas: uchicago CS? dont see that every day
JohnnyThe_Hobo: song name?
vHyphy: @ehguyincanada oh well in UC‚Äôs it‚Äôs taught as data science under R
EhGuyInCanada: @tuskan_bananas double majoring in physics as well but yeah
sevaric: @DeeboMC, no, but less likely to get automatically flagged by a bot
girtss3: Too loud
luspr: @JohnnyThe_Hobo Saves the Day
aymen_kh: what is he doing chat
HookMeOneMoreTim3: @ehguyincanada Yeah, we just had theoretical explaining what functional programming is, and of course, didn't really learn a thing. OOPs are in focus for most colleges in my country. Of course, including C.
shoraibit: saves the day reminds me of brand new -- your favorite weapon
luspr: George giving book recommendations PogChamp
sevaric: uni be like J A V A.
SurfCat: But what is he doing with it, a chat bot or?
aymen_kh: what is he doing chat
luspr: Halting Problem ensures our jobs
girtss3: What do you mesn when you said learn you a haskell kinda explains monads?
EhGuyInCanada: @hookmeonemoretim3 yeah it‚Äôs sadly under appreciated
lightb00k: hello
shoraibit: yea jailbreak the simulation with functional programming
badpartyhouse: vim set up?
solitaryyy: We need to free Shkreli
luspr: @georgehotz How was the rest of white noise, recommendation?
lightb00k: code a quine @georgehotz
shoraibit: but if the programmers who made the simulation used formal languages maybe we wont be able to get out
adroniser: Halting problem is purely of theoretical interest right?
joaovictorsnt: @georgehotz what does mena eval ?
anguscupcake: lol
shoraibit: lol
Plurmorant: good timeout
sevaric: @girtss3 I feel it does a good job at explaining the function of monads, but glosses over where the idea comes from. I really enjoyed reading Bartosz Milewski 's book, which filled a lot of those gaps for me.
luspr: Just use vim LUL
EhGuyInCanada: very soon these timeouts are gonna turn into bans
freshsoclean: we want python\
Aenopixel: jajaj nice
TowlieGotHigh: monkaS ban streak
hugenotte383: Haskell is such a nice language we had a nice course in uni
EhGuyInCanada: i low key would like George to teach us vim lmao
wraith_: lol
vHyphy: Has geohot studied network theory?
SurfCat: monkaS So how about dem monads bois
bravech: @EhGuyInCanada just use vimtutor
hugenotte383: hugenotte383 subscribed with Twitch Prime. 
badpartyhouse: vimmm
jagger_rsw: Is it like Rocko's (George's) Basilisk - if you don't buy a subscription now, you'll be punished when he becomes dictator of the world
gigafact: guys please don't push it on George. be quite if you don't have anything good to say
badpartyhouse: vim set up Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1
aymen_kh: chat what is he doing !!
EhGuyInCanada: @bravech cool I‚Äôll check it out
wraith_: maybe check his github for his dotfiles
wraith_: if u care about configs that much
timonx01: guys stay on topic
bigie: I can't the haskel but I do enjoy the banning
Incurs0: Good afternoon George and chat :) /
ced0xF: maybe False (const True) is just a convoluted way of converting a Maybe into a Bool
brickeyy: "html progeammers" EleGiggle
1ntegral_: Are you going to do some Ocaml one day ?
luspr: Is this tutorial similar to SICP?
adroniser: @georgehotz You can set up a separate channel for offtopic chat and then just look at one channel
thecoder15: hahah
bigie: *understand
badpartyhouse: Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1
Vjasal: test today?
vHyphy: SICP is the bible for CS
vHyphy: Wow geohot is anonymous
badpartyhouse: noooo Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1
brickeyy: 4Head
SurfCat: What was that last book he showed? The one after 'Category theory for programmers'
TheJonesEffect: Stop bothering George. If you wanna learn vim, watch ThePrimeagen (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8ENHE5xdFSwx71u3fDH5Xw).
1ntegral_: Are you going to do some Ocaml programming one day ? @georgehotz
TowlieGotHigh: Do emotes count towards off-topic comments?
anguscupcake: need to make a machine learning moderator
brickeyy: PogChamp yes
Incurs0: It would work 100%
KeyLogan_: You‚Äôd probably ban a lot of good viewers
ced0xF: @SurfCat Structure and interpretation of computer programs
luspr: It would work. But then we would have less rants :-(
SurfCat: thanks
badpartyhouse: lol Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1
adroniser: Yeah but you are top of science and technology section most streams so you will get new viewers
sevaric: do notation is a little misleading. <- is really just binding to an anonymous function of the rest of the block
byte_baron: how are you going to make use of haskell, is it for a specific project?
lightb00k: yup
BernardoFire: are we writing a programming language? i dont understand what Scheme is lol
smurfd0: they had a live thing on the haskell site
vHyphy: I‚Äôll program a machine learning bot for mod. I just need to get paid for it
Incurs0: @luspr You have a good point
smurfd0: http://goto.ucsd.edu:8090/index.html#?demo=SimpleRefinements.hs
vHyphy: LUL
gigafact: yes maybe the reason why people do off topic is to upset George...
KeyLogan_: I think you should make clearly defined rules and have mods timeout people, you clearly have a vision for how you want chat to function
aymen_kh: hello chat anyone can tell me, for the love of our ugly god, what is he doing at the current moment
hugenotte383: having :t in haskell literally saved my life
echotaco: You can probably see how many unique chatters you have per stream in your dashboard somewhere to see if it would be feasible
jmv_chin: is talking about your new apartment off topic Kappa
sybik: just dont say it 4Head
sevaric: @aymen_kh getting comfortable with Haskell
Vjasal: @georgehotz test today?
BernardoFire: what is Scheme @georgehotz ?
lightb00k: what is he doing now? I just came
skykanin: @BernardoFire Scheme is a lisp dialect
1ntegral_: What's the dirfference between Ocaml and Haskell ? main differences ? @georgehotz
georgecoldz: if a word is not in SICP, you are banned! - Commander.ai
adroniser: Actually now he has the 3month chatting only limit new viewers shouldn't be an issue
joaovictorsnt: @georgehotz provides a typesafe (to a limit) form of runtime evaluation
Incurs0: Plus if you ban someone, they won't necessarily stop watching
ranchleo: @BernardoFire lisp interpreter
Santiago_LHC: Are timing out people? I'm back
aymen_kh: @sevaric thnx
badpartyhouse: its fun to watch him go on a rant Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1
vHyphy: !followage
timonx01: @bernardofire you should read write yourself a scheme in 48 hours
girtss3: Just make a test where top people become moderators and then they will filter out all the stupid comentators.
luspr: On-topic: Can you share how you plan to use Haskell in the future?
restitutione: what is he trying to do today just learn more about haskell or a specific topic?
badpartyhouse: you would be in the ahit pile for sure Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1
EhGuyInCanada: Yeah make a test and like >99th percentile of a test get mod
adroniser: Putting on-topic in front of a question doesn't make it on-topic
costcospizza: true
sevaric: @1ntegral_ strict vs lazy evaluation. io through impurity vs pure monads. generics vs typeclasses
BernardoFire: @timonx01 i'm trying, but i'm newbie
thecoder15: lol
mr_dd_: ao qualcuno da roma?
HookMeOneMoreTim3: On what chapter are you on? I got tired after trying out the parser chapter. It seems like you're near end.
iizmerkk: @mr_dd_ non da roma
colanzio5: so is env mutable here?
1ntegral_: @sevaric I've coded some projects in ocaml and Lazy evaluation exists in Ocaml. So do you think Haskell is better when dealing with types ?
sevaric: I find it easier to understand if I convert monads I don't quite get from do notation to bind chains.
timonx01: @bernardofire ok then you should start with a basic haskell tutorial. That should help you unterstand what george is doing right now as well
Santiago_LHC: Off topic questions: time out
vHyphy: @hookmeonemoretim3 I know, the book drags on. I‚Äôm still at the Case Study on pointers & bytes
badpartyhouse: Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1 Cheer1
SHAVEYY_: PogChamp
shiftpgdn: is George escaping the simulation
yeah_haey: yo did i miss the test
luspr: Yes via a Haskell tutorial
hugenotte383: What do monads do again?
SurfCat: I have been tempted to try haskell too lately, but for work I have to use c# a lot so was thinking about F#. Anyone here experience with F# ?
yeah_haey: programming languages are dumb just code in rust
vHyphy: @yeah_haey no, it‚Äôs on Tuesday bro
ced0xF: setVar needs to return an IO LIspVal I think, as its mutating the environment
parasite_is_a_snakee: budget martin shkreli
joaovictorsnt: @georgehotz eval provides a typesafe (to a limit) form of runtime evaluation
sevaric: @1ntegral_ I guess Haskell technically has strict eval too, but I think of it mostly as "the lazy functional language". As for the type system, Haskell's is certainly more complex (and expressive imo), but it also forces a lot of constraints because it requires purity. they're certainly different (OCaml is way faster) but I think they're both interesting. it's mostly just different approaches at the same problem and seeing both sides can be informative.
sevaric: whoops all essay
1ntegral_: @sevaric Very well said. I agree
ced0xF: He's using liftIO because he adds an extra monad for error handling, without error handling I don't think it's needed
1ntegral_: @sevaric Ocaml is very fast yeah as compared to haskell
sevaric: that lifts to an IO operation when a monad is wrapped in an IO monad transformer
jmv_chin: omega return
lambdaman0f: liftIO allows a regular function to act on IO values
sevaric: as long as you are acting on a monad under IO, yes
ced0xF: Could just unsafePerformIO lol
1ntegral_: Functional languages are 80 % type fixing and debugging, the rest 20% is easy
DasMastah: Can't remove IO since return wraps into IO
El1T3MaN: Kappa
W1lkins: Just shell out to python 4Head
bigie: @W1lkins i second this. i'm not understanding shit
bambikapelo: if you are not using monad transformers you probably don't need liftIO
jmv_chin: yay new errors
joaovictorsnt: I'm new here, why he is using haskell
homebr3w: @georgehotz Hey man. Watched any of the Defcon talks today/yesterday?
joaovictorsnt: New in the live
nesbylol: what language is this?
sevaric: @joaovictorsnt it's fun bingShrug
hugenotte383: haskell
Santiago_LHC: Timeouts for everyone
homebr3w: @Santiago_LHC Test taken yet?
joaovictorsnt: scheming is nice
gigafact: no test today. George wrote a blog instead. stop asking about thee test
bobert_____: Oh George your io is expanding
Xingjuice: George doesn't use any plugins with vim right? Just vim and tmux?
lambdaman0f: return $ apply ...
bobert_____: It‚Äôs swallowing all the code
jmv_chin: WOot
lambdaman0f: return
homebr3w: @gigafact Nice, just got here. Thanks.
W1lkins: ofcourse someone named lambdaman solves it
n1proton: what is he doing?
jmv_chin: scheming Kappa
sevaric: or `pure` of you want to be fancy Kappa
adroniser: @n1proton Making a schema I think
lambdaman0f: George you should look at type signatures more that will explain everything
Zean__: HahaBall
joaovictorsnt: this is hard to understand
KeyLogan_: Woo!
sevaric: PogChamp
joaovictorsnt: GHC is the compiler ??
adroniser: yeah
sevaric: @joaovictorsnt yes
joaovictorsnt: thanks
sevaric: and ghci is the repl
colanzio5: If you'
FargioFarmani: FLEX PogO
vHyphy: Thanks
KeyLogan_: It would be hard to follow if you‚Äôre just now tuning in (like joining halfway through a math course)
zafke: Wait why I should do that?
colanzio5: **if you dont understand just copy paste the tutorial yourself
bambikapelo: you don't really need the liftIO there
jkfsda: stop ignoring chat for a girl BabyRage
anguscupcake: it would probably be good to know some haskell first
KeyLogan_: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll pick you up at 8 ;) ‚Äú is better
ced0xF: liftIO is only needed if you're in a monad stack that has IO somewhere
luspr: girls are temporary, Haskell is forever.
ced0xF: You shouldn't need any of them if you're not handling errors
sevaric: *sunset with Simon Peyton Jones smiling in the sky behind a mountain*
bobert_____: @luspr Haskell is immutable üôè
lambdaman0f: look at the type of fmap
sevaric: it's like super lift
rojobuffalo: did someone mention a blog post? can't find his blog
sevaric: think of it like a container
jkfsda: so it's an Adapter Pattern?
sevaric: you can inject a function into it
ranchleo: he didnt publish it
Santiago_LHC: Welcome
anguscupcake: I'm gonna learn haskell now
Penguino138: If I say the word "Haskell" then can I'm on topic lol
jmv_chin: knighting ur viewers ha
jmv_chin: i wanna be knighted
joaovictorsnt: worth to learn haskell than c++ ??
thecoder15: I smite you with muh sword
rojobuffalo: need a sword emoji
lambdaman0f: every monad is a functor (ish)
bambikapelo: map is basically the same as fmap but only for lists
sevaric: @joaovictorsnt Haskell has made me much better at writing templates. they complement each other
pxlluu: I started learning haskell just to follow the stream. Thanks @georgehotz for introducing it to me
colanzio5: If you're not handling errors, isn't maybe not needed - I though maybe is used in cases where a function is called into an undefined state
bambikapelo: fmap is more general, so it also works for Maybe, IO and other functors
trajenx: fmap is like map but for any container
joaovictorsnt: @sevaric that's cool, I'll take a look on this
ced0xF: fromJust
lambdaman0f: e.g. fmap show somethingInIO
adroniser: Is fmap applying the functor to a function?
jmv_chin: Hoogle monkaW
ced0xF: import Data.Maybe
lambdaman0f: fromJust
lambdaman0f: will blow up though
sevaric: you can also fill it with a default
Spacejuly: hi youtube
FargioFarmani: mzero is synonymous to mempty from the Monoid type class and mplus corresponds to mappend.
bobert_____: You could have found fromJust through hoogle just by searching it‚Äôs type signature: ‚ÄúMaybe a -> a‚Äù
Water_Closet: nice hASSkel by the way KappaPride KappaPride KappaPride
sevaric: fromJust is partial though, so I only use it when I know an operation is infallible and the maybe is there by mistake
1ntegral_: There's a lot of map_ function, the return type is what differenciate between them like map_iter etc @georgehotz
Santiago_LHC: The github for anyone interested: https://github.com/geohot/haskell-scheme
Water_Closet: sick++
lambdaman0f: referential transparency
sevaric: probably my favorite thing about Haskell is that if I want to do something, I just need to write a signature in Hoogle and usually there's a function in base that does that. LUL
lambdaman0f: void tryMe()
FargioFarmani: Just because something is made an instance of the Monad type class doesn't mean that it's a monad, it just means that it was made an instance of a type class.
vHyphy: Unit test everything
KeyLogan_: Seti shouldn‚Äôt conditional use _i
Water_Closet: popeython
Sasukey7: thats why large code bases need strongly typed languages
trajenx: void get
cybergenik: main
colanzio5: i isnt set
bambikapelo: i <= 0

wgz90: shouldnt c also be unsigned char
DasMastah: Make len unsigned
joaovictorsnt: c++ ??
gigafact: but how is even possible that bad code get pass the compiler
trajenx: not checking ret from malloc
DasMastah: Or better; make len size_t
reesync: not freeing memory
Water_Closet: free at dtor
Water_Closet: missing
colanzio5: _len could be negative xD
lithiumx4900: bounds checking doesn't happen by the compiler.
DasMastah: And you need a semicolon after the class definition
smurfd0: muscle memory for  :)
HookMeOneMoreTim3: in malloc size of?
Water_Closet: check malloc + free at dtor
gigafact: it's so easy to write bad code. should be programming languages more strict about bad code
Water_Closet: ya compilers should kick noobs at balls @gigafact
Water_Closet: LUL
gigafact: write bad code = your computer explodes
sevaric: optimized LUL
FargioFarmani: 97
Santiago_LHC: it's the same with human languages. It's easy to write wrong. You say something dumb = timeout.
jmv_chin: big brain santiago
luandevecchi: lol
sevaric: bruh
luandevecchi: public boi
sevaric: code=gone
trajenx: it needs to know the size right?
Water_Closet: h ass kel strim
bambikapelo: class is default private, struct is default public
HookMeOneMoreTim3: you set private
Water_Closet: size maters
lambdaman0f: or struct
DasMastah: You're defining it twice
luandevecchi: header guard tho
voxelfox0125: have you used godbolt.org it shows asm as you write c++.
solitaryyy: What was the rationale behind thinking clang would result in smaller code?
luandevecchi: yeah, compiler explorer is awesome
JokaGS: YO i wasnt here since the beguinning , can some tell me what is his goal ?
1ntegral_: What was the main point here ? Nothing is private ? @georgehotz
Water_Closet: +1 for gobolt
W1lkins: LUL
sevaric: LUL
luandevecchi: someone tell him about compiler explorer lol
smurfd0: maby delete a.out inbetween??
bismarck_91: Clang is the OG.
Water_Closet: your code has leak
cybergenik: what program do you use to snap your windows like that to the sides?
sevaric: LLVM is Hot approved
sevaric: *Hotz
solitaryyy: llvm is great
Drifter0o: @georgehotz hey bro hope you are doing fine
Water_Closet: üêÑ cow mpiler
DasMastah: "Add new source editor"
gigafact: is go any better at this?
1ntegral_: As you were saying in the beginning of your point nothing is really private @georgehotz
FargioFarmani: COBOL is better
smurfd0: What, no Watcom ?
Water_Closet: force no inline
Water_Closet: gcc attr
luandevecchi: __attribute__((noinline)) for gcc
mondasama: !uptime
krnflake1: next to the logo, you can add files I think, then it won't inline?
bottonresult: !uptime
Crypod: D: the disrespect
bill1929: i feel the same way
bottonresult: !commands
FargioFarmani: georgehotz is streaming for 1h 38min
audendana: @georgehotz how do you feel about the mathematical universe hypothesis https://arxiv.org/pdf/0704.0646.pdf
gigafact: this is deep
Water_Closet: nice pair of haskels
bobert_____: There is a beautiful example of an optimizer reasoning that appears to disprove fermats last theorem
Water_Closet: (.)(.)
dark_krotonus: Oh no. I‚Äôm late. I missed the test. How was it ?
unixporn: @georgehotz how do i learn to read this stuff on the right screen ? how is that even called ?
KeyLogan_: Assembly code
colanzio5: I mean he's literally defining a public setter in the class, the problem would be if he set it like... C->a = 8
voxelfox0125: @unixporn https://www.tutorialspoint.com/assembly_programming/index.htm
sevaric: once you get the lingo, assembly is pretty simple
wgz90: since hes using malloc does he need to free a or does the destructor does it automatically?
Water_Closet: show me your assEmbly " is my pickup line
1ntegral_: @bobert_____ fermat's last theorem ? in Number theory ?
bobert_____: Can I link the example?
luandevecchi: types are just sizes Kappa
bobert_____: @1ntegral_ Yeah it‚Äôs kind of a lol
solitaryyy: @luandevecchi what do you mean by that?
unixporn: @voxelfox0125 So if you can output any language to assembly, you have more information from reading it, is that the benefit ?
luandevecchi: @solitaryyy compiler cares about types size, not the type itself
bobert_____: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub Last one
1ntegral_: Haha xd @bobert_____
sevaric: types are just assertions during the compile step
1ntegral_: yeah I've seen this, I was deaaaaaaad LUL
bobert_____: I reproed it once it was setting dependant
voxelfox0125: @unixporn pretty much
lightofhel1: yo, how we are doing? @georgehotz
FargioFarmani: Is there similar code for Collatz conjecture?
unixporn: @voxelfox0125 and you can do this with pretty much any language, even interpreted ones (php, python) etc ?
lambdaman0f: make illegal states unrepresentable
voxelfox0125: @unixporn the source programming language is all ways going to give more information.
jmv_chin: LUL
luandevecchi: i dont think so @voxelfox0125
adroniser: fermats last theorem is the assertion there are no solutions, so you mean it proves It up to 1000?
luandevecchi: not at all tho
sevaric: @unixporn assembly is an annotated version of the machine code c compiles to. since python doesn't compile to machine code, there is no assembly.
1ntegral_: Yeah this is clearly a compiler joke otherwise it would have done some noise don't you think
bottonresult: to disprove fermat last theorem you just need to find a counter example
ced0xF: Its only the cubic case of Fermat, which I think Euler disproved
joaovictorsnt: I'm lost
adroniser: a and b are symmetrical
unixporn: @sevaric oh, so we cant do this stuff with php etc. I don't code in compiled languages fml.
DasMastah: Make MAX non-const
HookMeOneMoreTim3: I think you can, but it will be a big complexity
sevaric: @unixporn yea. you can see the assembly of php itself though
trajenx: what set of numbers are you trying to generate. like 1000 c 3 ?
colanzio5: define MAX as an iterative iterator and call next at the end
voxelfox0125: @lambdaman0f I reverse engineer all lot so i dont see the source often so I come to that conclusion.
colanzio5: **infinite iterator
bobert_____: Initialize b=a and c=b right?
bambikapelo: it will not go to 1 2 2
unixporn: @sevaric is it possible to use Qira debugger for php ?
sevaric: no idea
bottonresult: look, it doesnt say fermat theorem has been proved, it says fermat theorem has not been disproved
adroniser: @georgehotz 1 2 2 is equivalent to 2 1 1
adroniser: for flt
DasMastah: But addition is commutative
axlebear: count to 999
sevaric: @unixporn also, because php does a lot, it may not be too helpful
sevaric: lotta noise in the debugger
FargioFarmani: Every heard of infinite descent? @georgehotz
adroniser: oh nevermind i was dumb lol I presumed it was in the form c^3 = a^3+b^3 didn't read the code
bottonresult: diagonal argument for enumarability of rational numbers
unixporn: @sevaric you mean, the output of asssembly will be too bloated ?
sevaric: @unixporn there's no assembly, but you can step through the CPU instructions php runs. because it's so complex, a lot of other things will be happening at the same time as your code
sevaric: Hilbert curve?
HookMeOneMoreTim3: can yo do something with a matrix?
Karuso33: diagonals was definitely the right idea
ced0xF: I think SICP has a quote like that
unixporn: @sevaric so basically this will introduce whole new game of bloated trash that its not even worth investing time into ? :D
prakyath_kantharaju: for 1 space filling thing use the circle equation and increase the radius at each iteration.
adroniser: b and c must be less than a, and you can presume b is less than c because of symmetry
Zer01123: c and b are symetric
bambikapelo: c <= b
Zer01123: ^
kishavan: you have to fill successive concentric cubes
trajenx: i thought you only needed to do it for 2d space for this fermats thing
FargioFarmani: c = pow(pow_sum, 1.0 / n) c_pow = pow(int(c), n)
PeinlicherAffe: ++i > i++ cmonBruh
mannekchin: which language is this?
luandevecchi: meaningless for loops @PeinlicherAffe
mannekchin: gifted sub TriHard
1ntegral_: Some use integer overflows and a small exponent n and some floating point conversions to disprove the theorem, I dont know is it's a valid method tho @georgehotz
luandevecchi: but i would stay with ++i anyway
Mayfieldiv: why would you want it to include 1 2 2? a always has to be bigger than each b and c for the sides to match
PeinlicherAffe: @luandevecchi no
y2kbuggerr: y2kbuggerr subscribed at Tier 1. 
luandevecchi: @PeinlicherAffe yes lol
PeinlicherAffe: @luandevecchi explain
axlebear: using more instead of less?
sevaric: you can do the dumb approach of counting with an ever increasing base
DasMastah: It would suffice with 2D space since it can be applied for B and C only for each value of A
luandevecchi: @PeinlicherAffe ++i will increment AND i will be incremented on that moment. i++ will iterate it AFTER that moement
FargioFarmani: int pow_sum = pow(a, n) + pow(b, n); double c = pow(pow_sum, 1.0/n); int c_pow = pow((int)c, n);
bottonresult: you need the constructive method to prove a number system with 3 components is countable
sevaric: k++ until k=j, the. j++, repeat k, eventually update i
luandevecchi: @PeinlicherAffe as we use ++ in the last argument on loop, it doesnt matter
axlebear: 4Shrug
gigafact: what we do on this stream haha
colanzio5: http://pdebuyl.be/blog/2015/hilbert-curve.html - halfway down the page
PeinlicherAffe: @luandevecchi i++ will create a copy of i and increment it afterwards
HookMeOneMoreTim3: can you do the 2d space, but add to every pair third number via loop?
kishavan: hilbert curves cover all reals don't they?
luandevecchi: @PeinlicherAffe hm, nope. compiler is smart enough to just increment it
unixporn: Chat, what da hell am i watching ? xD
hayewood: xqcL
sevaric: but aren't we just doing the integers?
PeinlicherAffe: @luandevecchi ++i will instantly increment it without copying it
luandevecchi: @PeinlicherAffe in loops, of course.
1ntegral_: here is a discussion on the subject and solutions to this problem on stackexchange https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/32696/disprove-fermats-last-theorem
luandevecchi: @PeinlicherAffe no sir, in loops it doesnt matter.
adroniser: The cartesian product of countable sets is countable so by induction Z^n is countable for all integer n. But that doesn't provide an explicit construction. You can just use concentric cubes. The hilbert curve is meant to fill space, not to do with bijection between N and N^2. Bijection between N and N^2 can be done with concentric squares
PeinlicherAffe: @luandevecchi can you link me something for proof?
DasMastah: I don't think you want a space-filling algorithm though. The space is symmetrical along the diagonal, so you need to make the lower (or upper) triangle countable.
Zer01123: you want a mapping from N ->(N,N,N)?
ShredderSherlock: Are Hilda curves related to fractals
luandevecchi: @PeinlicherAffe lmao, can you compile a loop and disasm it?
luandevecchi: 4Head
incertia: incertia subscribed at Tier 1. 
sevaric: 111, 211, 212, 221, 222, 311, 312, etc
PeinlicherAffe: @luandevecchi you mean disassemby?
luandevecchi: yes
adroniser: Hilbert curves are meant to be bijection from the continuous interval [0,1] to the interval [0,1]x[0,1]
PeinlicherAffe: @luandevecchi i can but why should i?
kishavan: ah, I think I know an algorithm: iterate over the sum of the 3 points. for each such sum, iterate over all triples adding to it.
PeinlicherAffe: @luandevecchi link me proof or go away 4Head
incertia: you fix a sum, you loop a from 0 to sum, you loop b from 0 to sum - a, and c is sum - a - b
sevaric: you know you could do this easily with a Haskell list comprehension Kappa
kishavan: it's tricky because of negative integers
Astgh: hello guys. what is george doing?
bottonresult: yeah, that will do
tor0nt0saur: hello george
lrnq: EZ CLAP
luandevecchi: @PeinlicherAffe what? you are the one looking for proofs lol
sevaric: @Astgh disproving Fermat's last theorem (tangent. we're actually writing a scheme interpreter in Haskell)
czz78_: lsum intead of sum
PeinlicherAffe: @luandevecchi you think i am wrong, so i want you to link me proof 4Head
FargioFarmani: FERMAT = not (Exists a . Exists b . Exists c . Exists n . n > 2 /\ a^n + b^n = c^n)
axlebear: EZ Clap
HookMeOneMoreTim3: elegant
mannekchin: if you are dumb then im an ape
unixporn: @georgehotz is Qira usable with interpreted languages (php, python etc) ?
data_disciple: I love you George. you crack me up. Thanks by the way this is helping me with my functional programming languages course.
KeyLogan_: Any chance you could explain the solution?
kishavan: what about negative integers? I guess you could reflect the points to the other octants
lrnq: scheming in haskell pt 2 *opens link to see c++*
sevaric: @kishavan Fermat only concerns the natural numbers
