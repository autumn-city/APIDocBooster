,,LSTMCell is the basic building block of an LSTM network.,Is it possible to implement a multilayered LSTM with LSTMCells modules in PyTorch?,www.stackoverflow.com/questions/48080000,"In PyTorch there is a LSTM module which in addition to input sequence, hidden states, and  cell states accepts a num_layers argument which specifies how many layers will our LSTM have.
There is however another module LSTMCell which has just input size and number of hidden states as parameters, there is no num_layers since this is a single cell in a multi-layered LSTM. 
My question is what is the proper way to connect together the LSTMCell modules to achieve a same effect as a multi layered LSTM with num_layers > 1
