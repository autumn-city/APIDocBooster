,,LSTM is a recurrent layer,What's the difference between LSTM() and LSTMCell()?,www.stackoverflow.com/questions/48187283,"I've checked the source code for both functions, and it seems that LSTM() makes the LSTM network in general, while LSTMCell() only returns one cell. 
However, in most cases people only use one LSTM Cell in their program. Does this mean when you have only one LSTM Cell (ex. in simple Seq2Seq), calling LSTMCell() and LSTM() would make no difference?
