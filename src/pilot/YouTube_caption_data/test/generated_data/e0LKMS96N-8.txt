hello everyone welcome to the channel my
name is vishali and today we will learn
about python linear and the following
are the topics that we are going to
discuss firstly we will discuss about
python's annual linear after that we
will understand about pythog and in
linear initialization
and then
we will discuss about pythog and a
linear example
and after that we will understand about
pythons and endoth linear activation
and after that we will understand about
python's and intuit linear sigmoid and
in the last we will discuss about python
and induct linear in underscore features
so without any delay let's jump to the
topic and discuss about python and in
linear
before moving forward we should have a
piece of knowledge about a linear
equation the linear equation is in the
form of a x is equal to a b
where we can define x as an input and b
as an output
and a is defined as a way i touch any
linear is a module which is used to
create a single layer feed forward
network with any inputs and m outputs so
let us understand the concept of
whitewatch and a linear with the help of
an example
here is our example
firstly we will import the library as
import torch
after importing the library here we are
declaring the variable by using towards
an input linear function
and after that we are printing the
network structure weight and bias using
print function now execute this cell and
you can see that
the network structure
the weight of the network and the bias
of the network are printed on the screen
now move forward and discuss about
python and linear initialization
as we know the anal linear is a module
which is used to create a single layer
feed for our network with the help of n
inputs and m outputs pythons and a
linear initialization in which we can
also create the feed forward network
with the help of the input and outputs
now let us understand the concept with
the help of an example to clear our
doubt
here is our example so firstly we will
import all the necessary libraries such
as import torch and import torch.nn
after importing all the necessary
libraries here we are creating a model
class
using
init and forward methods after creating
the modal class here we are declaring
the variable
by using
torch.random function
and then we are initializing the
optimizer
and after that we are declaring the
output variable by using those dot
random function
and in the last we are declaring the
variable by using model dot linear dot v
dot clone function
now execute this cell and you can see
that the feed forward network is printed
on the screen
now move forward and discuss
ito's dot linear example and discuss the
pythos and a linear example
the anal linear module is used to
calculate the linear equation
the linear equation is in the form of ax
is equal to b
where x is input and b is output and a
is the weight
the anal linear module is also defined
as
the single layer feed forward network
so let us understand the concept with
the help of an example
here is our example so firstly we will
import all the necessary libraries such
as import coach import variable from
source.autograde import toast.nn
and import toast.function
after importing all the necessary
libraries here we are creating a model
class by using
init and forward methods after creating
a model class here we are creating an
instance of the model
and then we are declaring the parameter
and after that we want to print the
parameter length by using print function
now execute this cell and you can see
that the feed forward network is created
with the help of n and dot linear
modules let's move forward and discuss
about pi torch and then dot linear
activation
pythog anon.linear activation function
is defined as the process
which takes the input and output
attributes
and prepares the matrix the annento
prelu is used as an activation function
that creates the network and also fit
the complex data
now let us understand the concept of
python and dot linear activation with
the help of an example
here is our example
so firstly we will import all the
necessary libraries such as import torch
import tools dot nn import doors dot and
in dot function
after importing all the necessary
libraries here we are declaring the
variable using
torch.tensor function
and then we are calling the softmax
activation function and after that we
are calling the sigmoid activation
function and after that we are calling
10 h activation function and then we are
calling
reload activation function
and in the last we are calling leaky
relu activation function and after that
we are creating a moral class by using
init and forward methods and then we are
using the activation function directly
in the forward pass
now execute this cell
and you can see that the python dot
linear activation values are printed on
the screen
now move forward and discuss about pi
torch and endoth linear sigmoid
pythog and endot linear sigmoid is a
nonlinear function and the activation
function for a neuron is the sigmoid
function
it always give the output of the unit in
between 0 and 1.
now
let us understand the concept of the
pythos and a dot linear sigmoid
with the help of an example to clear our
doubt here is our example
so firstly we will import the library as
import torch
after importing the library here we are
declaring the variable x and y
by using
torch.random and toast.sigmoid function
and then we want to create a model class
by using
init and forward methods and then we
create an instance of the model
and after that we are declaring the x
and y variable by using towards dot
random function now execute this cell
and you can see that the pi torch anon
dot linear segment value is printed on
the screen
now
move forward and discuss about python
and endot linear in underscore features
python's anecdote linear in underscore
features is defined as a process that
applies a linear change to incoming data
in underscore feature is a parameter
that is used as the size of the every
input sample
now let us understand the concept of
python and android linear in underscore
features with the help of an example to
clear our doubt
here is our example
so firstly we will import all the
necessary libraries such as import torch
and import toast.nn
after importing the library here we are
declaring a variable
by using torch.tensorfunction
and then we are describing the variable
n by using an n dot linear function
now execute this cell and you can see
that the pi torch and then look linear
in underscore feature data is printed on
the screen so with this we have learned
about python channel linear
