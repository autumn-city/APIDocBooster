Then we will go on here again, it will receive receive the  hidden state and the cell state from the previous time step, the current time step input, output something and so forth. So that's how the LSTM cell class works."
Now, the LSTM cell class is, it's kind of like  part of the LSTM, it's a smaller unit, like LSTM cell is, is  only a small unit. And we can actually use both on either the  LSTM or the LSTM cell for implementing the character RNN.
LSTMCell is an object (which happens to be a layer too) used by the LSTM layer that contains the calculation logic for one step.
The cell contains the core code for the calculations of each step, while the recurrent layer commands the cell and performs the actual recurrent calculations.
Alghout it seems, because of its name, that LSTMCell is a single cell, it is actually an object that manages all the units/cells as we may think.
