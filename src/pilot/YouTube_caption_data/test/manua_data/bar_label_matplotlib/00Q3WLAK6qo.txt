hi in this video we want to talk about how to plot 
a 3d bar chart like this in python programming  
language so please stay tuned suppose that we have 
three countries a b and c and the corresponding  
population of each country and we want to plot 
a 3d bar chart like this in order to do so first  
of all you should import you should simply type 
from mpl toolkits import mplot 3d which is used  
for plotting 3d charts and also we need to import 
matplotlib so we simply type import matplotlib  
dot pyplot matplotlib.pyplot as plt there it is 
now we need to define a couple of variables in  
order to plot a chart like this the first three 
variables are the starting point of each bar for  
example as you can see in this chart we have three 
bars the red bar the green bar and the blue bar  
the red bar is the population of country a 
the green bar is the population of country b  
and the blue bar is the population of country c 
so what is the starting point of this first bar  
i mean the red bar as you can see the x of the 
first bar is one so as you can see the x of the  
first bar is one so i define a variable called x 
which for the first bar is one for the second bar  
is two there it is and for the third bar it is 
three but now let's talk about the y variable  
so if you want to talk about the y variable 
what is the y-coordinate for the first bar  
it is zero so as you can see this is the zero and 
remember that the starting point is is the bottom  
left point so this is the point that you should 
notice so the y-coordinates of the of the red bar  
is zero the y coordinate of the second bar which 
is green is also zero and the y coordinates of  
this bar is again zero so as you can see the 
y of all the bars are zero that's it but now  
let's talk about the z variable as you can see the 
starting point the z coordinates of the starting  
point for the red bar is also zero remember that 
the starting point is bottom left so this is the  
point that we are talking about so as you can see 
the z coordinate of this point is zero so as you  
can see the z coordinates of this point is zero 
and what about this bar again the z coordinates  
of this bar for the starting point is zero and 
for the starting point of this bar is again zero  
so the z variable is zero zero and zero so 
that's it so here we have to find three variables  
which are the coordinates of the starting point 
of each bar so now we want to define another  
three variables which are delta x dx delta 
y dy and also delta z dz so for example here  
as you can see for the first part which is the red 
bar the delta x the delta x is one so you can see  
that the delta x is one so one and what about the 
delta y so as you can see the delta y of the first  
bar of the first bar is also one and the delta 
z is the height of this bar and the delta z is  
the height of this bar which is one which is the 
population of that country so that's it and let's  
talk about the delta x of the let's talk about 
the delta x of the green bar which is one again
and the delta value of this bar is again one 
and the delta z i mean the height of this bar  
is four so that's it and the delta x of the third 
bar is one the delta y is again one and the delta  
z i mean the height of the third bar is two so 
that's it so here we have defined six variables  
three variables for the starting point and three 
variables for the delta variables delta x delta y  
and delta z now let's plot the chart itself in 
order to do so first of all we need to create  
a figure so we simply type plt.figure because we 
want to create a figure and we want to call it fig  
and also we want to create axes which we are going 
to plot all the stuff on that axis so we simply  
type plt dot axes so we simply type plt.axes and 
remember that you should specify projection equals  
to 3d with a small d because you want to have a 3d 
chart and you are telling matplotlib that you want  
a axes you want an axes that have three dimensions 
not two dimensions so the projection should be 3d  
and for example you call the axes for example 
ax or whatever name you want so here we have  
defined figure and axes so now let's go ahead so 
i simply type ax dot bar3d but as you can see the  
auto completion of pycharm doesn't suggest you 
anything because it cannot recognize the type of  
this variable until it hasn't been executed 
so in order to get better auto completion  
of pycharm we want to run all the stuff in the 
console so i select all the lines and i right  
click and then select execute selection in python 
console then it should wait a couple of seconds so  
now you can see that here is our figure and here 
is the axes here is the figure and this is our  
axes and now we want to plot our bar chart on this 
axes so we simply type ax.bar3d that's it and we  
should define a couple of parameters a couple of 
arguments x y and z which are our variables which  
we have to find here x y and z the starting points 
of the bars and then delta x delta y and delta z  
and the color is a list which for example for the 
first bar we want a red color for the second one  
we want the green color and for the third one we 
want the blue color so that's it so i should press  
enter and as you can see we have three bars the 
first bar is red the second one is green and the  
third one is blue but now let's make this chart 
more beautiful and convert it to something like  
this first of all we want to define x label y 
label and z label so in order to do so we simply  
type ax dot set x label x label which is x and ax 
dot set y label y label which is y and ax dot set  
z label which is z so now we can see we have x 
label y label and z label and now let's change  
the x ticks and their corresponding labels so 
for example we simply type ax dot set x ticks and  
we should pass first of all we should pass the 
text positions so in this chart you can see the  
first position is one the second one is two and 
the third one is a three which is our x variable  
so our positions for the x ticks is x and 
their labels their their corresponding labels  
is our countries our countries variable which is a 
b c so we simply type countries there it is and if  
i press enter you can see that we have a better 
looking chart which it says that this is a bar  
for country a this is the bar for country b and 
this is the bar for country c and if you want to  
define the x ticks in the middle of the bar you 
can simply type ax dot set x ticks and you can  
pass 1.5 2.5 3.5 and then the country's variable 
so if you press enter now you can see that the  
x ticks is in the middle of the bar before 
going further let's copy all we have typed in  
the console and paste it to the editor because you 
want to have all the code in the editor so first  
of all we need to copy this and paste it here and 
then we need to copy this paste it here and also
and also copy this and paste it here and finally 
copy this and paste it here then we simply type  
plt dot show in order to show the chart so 
that's it here is our code but as you can see  
this chart i mean the chart on the right side 
is more beautiful than this chart why because  
the y positions in the right chart is from the 
y limits is from -1 all the way up to 3 but in  
this case it is not it is from 0 all the way up 
to 1 which makes it a little bit ugly you can fix  
this problem in a couple of manners in a couple 
of ways the first way is simply typing ax dot sets  
y limits y limit and it can simply define the 
limits for the y axis for example you can simply  
type minus one all the way up to for example three 
and if you press enter you can see that this chart  
is now a little bit more beautiful and it's 
somewhat similar to this chart and for zooming out  
from this chart you should press the right key on 
your mouse and drag up if you drag in it will zoom  
in if you drag up it will zoom out so you can see 
that if i zoom out now it's similar to this chart  
and the other way is to copy a code which i have 
found in this website which i will put the link in  
the description below and you can simply paste 
it in your code in the beginning of your code  
and because in this code it uses numpy package 
so you should import numpy so you should import  
numpy package as np and finally you can see 
that the name of the function is set_axes_equal  
so before plt.show not in the beginning 
and the reason i said before plt.show  
is because it should be after all the stuff 
about plotting so you simply type set_axes_equal  
you call the function and you should pass the 
axes which is the ax variable so if you run the  
code you can see here's the output and you can 
press the right key on your mouse in order and  
drag up in order to zoom out and now we 
can see we have a better looking chart
