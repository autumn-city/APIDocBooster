In most Activities, you will find that you will need to put code in onResume() and onPause(). 
 The implementation of onPause is very fast because the next activity is not resumed until this method returns.  And is either followed by onResume, if the activity returns back to the front, or onStop, if the activity is becoming invisible to the user.  This is how we implement this onPause callback method. 
 So let me just override other methods also.  OnStart and onResume... onPause... onStop... onRestart... and last, onDestroy. 
 Last but not the least, how we destroy our application, that is the destroying lifecycle. 
2- previous activity is completely covered by new activity: both onPause and onStop will be called
