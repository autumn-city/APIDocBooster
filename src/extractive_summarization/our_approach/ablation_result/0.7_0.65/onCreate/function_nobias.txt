 onCreate is responsible for creating your tables inside your SQLite database, and onUpgrade will be responsible for upgrading your database if you do make any changes. 
If you want onCreate() to run you need to use adb to delete the SQLite database file. 
Increment the database version so that onUpgrade() is invoked. 
onCreate will be invoked only when getWritableDatabase() or getReadableDatabase() is executed.  And this will only invoked once when a DBName specified in the first step is not available.
