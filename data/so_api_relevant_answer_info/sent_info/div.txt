If the only issue is height, just using divs seems to work:
In all sane browsers, you can put the "header" div before the content, as a sibling, and the same CSS will work.
If you are fortunate enough to be able to target IE8 and up, you can use display:table and related values to get the rendering rules of tables with block-level elements including div.
Since it is easy to make the content DIV the same height as the parent but apparently difficult to make it the parent height minus the header height I decided to make content div full height but position it absolutely in the top left corner and then define a padding for the top which has the height of the header.
I am using that approach to rescale the <div> with the Google Maps.
What worked for me (with a div within another div and I assume in all other circumstances) is to set the bottom padding to 100%.
None of the solutions posted work when you need the bottom div to scroll when the content is too tall.
[An alternate solution, with a div centered within the content div (hyper-link)]
There's a ton of answers now, but I found using height: 100vh; to work on the div element that needs to fill up the entire vertical space available.
In my case I applied this to the required div
All you have to do if you're using display: flex on the parent div is to simply set height to stretch or fill like so
Height of the 'content' DIV - That is placed between 'header' and 'footer' is found without doing any height calculation.
If you want to set the height of a <div> or any element, you should set the height of <body> and <html> to 100% too.
In the case of the question at hand, featuring a left and a right divider, here is a [JSFiddle example (hyper-link)] showing a two-column layout involving both vh and vw.
The p tag here is set to 100% height, but because its containing div has 200 pixels height, 100% of 200 pixels becomes 200 pixels, not 100% of the body height.
Using 100vh instead means that the p tag will be 100% height of the body regardless of the div height.
Use position:fixed instead of position:absolute, that way even if you scroll down the division will expand to the end of the screen.
And if you want to 2 div height same use or set the parent element display:flex property.
There are several methods available for setting the height of a <div> to 100%.
If you want to set the div width or height 100% of browser-window-size you should use:
In my React application I wanted the div to match the page high even when resized.
You can use the following CSS to make a div 100% of the height of the browser window:
Adjust the iframe height property as required (leave the div height property at 100vh).
In my real-world scenario I have a header inside the div, before the iframe, which consumes some vertical space - so I set the iframe to use 80% instead of 100% (otherwise it would be the height of the containing div, but start after the header, and overflow out the bottom of the div).
Here is a solution that will both vertically and horizontally align your img within a div without any stretching even if the image supplied is too small or too big to fit in the div.
You can set the image as the background to a div, and then use the [CSS background-size property (hyper-link)]:
Give the height and width you need for your image to the div that contains the <img> tag.
Define the div simply like:
Just put the image in a div and then in the HTML file where you specify the image.
To then calculate the height value you simply divide the height by the width which gives the percentage value of 80%.
This way, it makes the image bigger and it fills the div container.
All the provided answers, including the accepted one, work only under the assumption that the div wrapper is of a fixed size.
So this is how to do it whatever the size of the div wrapper is and this is very useful if you develop a responsive page:
Write these declarations inside your DIV selector:
The value of maxHeight must be the same for both the DIV and IMG selectors.
Now the image will take all the space of the div.
There are several ways to fit the image to <div>.
You can also float your div which will force it as small as possible, but you'll need to use a [clearfix (hyper-link)] if anything inside your div is floating:
Why do you need extra div around your table?
Another solution would be to wrap your div in another div (if you want to maintain the block behavior):
The solution is to set your div to display: inline-block.
I know people don't like tables sometimes, but I gotta tell you, I tried the css inline hacks, and they kinda worked in some divs but in others didn't, so, it was really just easier to enclose the expanding div in a table...and...it can have or not the inline property and still the table is the one that's gonna hold the total width of the content.
in the div.
Just change the content of the div.
I have solved a similar problem (where I didn't want to use display: inline-block because the item was centered) by adding a span tag inside the div tag, and moving the CSS formatting from the outer div tag to the new inner span tag.
I tried div.classname{display:table-cell;} and it worked!
For now you have to be satisfied with <span> or <div> set to
If you apply a float on your div, it works too but obviously, you need to apply a "clear both" CSS rules at the next HTML element.
My CSS3 flexbox solution in two flavors: The one on top behaves like a span and the one at the bottom behaves like a div, taking all the width with the help of a wrapper.
We can use any of the two ways on the div element:
This will make parent div width same as the largest element width.
OK, in many cases you even don't need to do anything as by default div has height and width as auto, but if it's not your case, applying inline-block display gonna work for you... look at the code I create for you and it's do what you looking for:
I've a span inside a div and just setting margin: auto to the container div worked for me.
This makes the div not larger than its content.
Try to use width: max-content property to adjust the width of the div by it's content size.
Using AlphaImageLoader, you can even put transparent .PNG/.GIFs in the overlay div and have clicks flow through to elements underneath.
But because the balloon with the pointer is wrapped in a div, some links under it aren't click able anymore.
attach a click to the div you want to be clicked through
In my case the overlaying div is absolutely positioned—I am not sure if this makes a difference.
Allowing the user to click through a div to the underlying element depends on the browser.
Put the content you want in a div;
make another cropped copy of the original div
overlay and abs position the copy div in the same place as the original content you want to be clickable with an even higher z-index?
wrapping the content will keep your hover effects and you can click in all the picture, div included, regards!
That second part is very helpful if you work with multiple overlapping div layers (probably some parents being transparent), where you need to be able to click on child elements and only that child elements.
I found the only way to display my image when loading the page then make it disappear and be able to click things where the image was located before hiding it was to put the image into a DIV, make the size of the DIV 10x10 pixels or small enough to prevent it causing an issue then hiding the containing div.
This allowed the image to overflow the div while visible and when the div was hidden, only the divs area was affected by inability to click objects beneath and not the whole size of the image the DIV contained and was displaying.
Once the image was inside a tiny DIV and I hid the tiny DIV, the entire area occupied by the image was clear and only the tiny area under the DIV I hid was affected but as I made it small enough (10x10 pixels), the issue was fixed (sort of).
You need to add the line-height attribute and that attribute must match the height of the div.
How to vertically and horizontally center text in both an unordered list and a div without resorting to JavaScript or CSS line heights.
No matter how much text you have you won't have to apply any special classes to specific lists or divs (the code is the same for each).
This centers the text in my div to the exact vertical middle of a 200px-high outer div.
But I have a <div> that's positioned absolutely, height:100% (actually, top:0;bottom:0 and fixed width) and display:table-cell just didn't work to center text vertically.
In it I have added an invisible (width=0) div that assumes the entire height of the container.
This is another variation of the div in a div pattern using calc() in CSS.
position:absolute for precise placement of the div within a div
we know the height of the inner div because we set it to 20px.
calc(50% - 10px) for 50% - half the height for centering the inner div
There are [several tricks (hyper-link)] to display content or an image in the center of a div.
With the following method, the text in the div will be centered vertically:
You can align center text vertically inside a div using Flexbox.
According to Adam Tomat's answer there was prepared a JSFiddle [example (hyper-link)] to align the text in div:
Try this, add on the parent div:
[Flexbox (hyper-link)] worked perfectly for me, centering multiple elements inside parent div horizontally & vertically.
CSS-Code:
Code below stacks all elements inside of parent-div in a column, centering the elements horizontally & vertically.
I used the child-div to keep the two Anchor elements on same line (row).
Without child-div all three elements (Anchor, Anchor & Paragraph) are stacked inside parent-div's column on top of each other.
Here only child-div is stacked inside parent-div column.
You can apply this CSS to the inner <div>:
Any width less than the containing <div> will work.
With flexbox it is very easy to style the div horizontally and vertically centered.
To align the div vertically centered, use the property align-items: center.
If you don't want to set a fixed width on the inner div you could do something like this:
That makes the inner div into an inline element that can be centered with text-align.
I recently had to center a "hidden" div (i.e., display:none;) that had a tabled form within it that needed to be centered on the page.
I wrote the following jQuery code to display the hidden div and then update the CSS content to the automatic generated width of the table and change the margin to center it.
Suppose that your div is 200 pixels wide:
If you don't know the width of your div, you can use transform:translateX(-50%); instead of the negative margin.
The outer div doesn't need any extra properties for this to work.
I have applied the inline style to the inner div.
Use the below CSS content for #inner div:
I mostly use this CSS content to center divs.
Set this property for the parent div.
If anyone would like a jQuery solution for center align these divs:
First of all: You need to give a width to the second div:
It puts the div at the center of the view (vertical and horizontal), sizes and adjusts for size, centers background image (vertical and horizontal), centers text (horizontal), and keeps div in the view and on top of the content.
The best way is using table-cell display (inner) that come exactly after a div with the display table (outer) and set vertical align for the inner div (with table-cell display) and every tag you use in the inner div placed in the center of div or page.
Just decide what width you want to give to the inner div and use the following CSS.
Add text-align:center; to parent div
For the inner <div>, the only condition is that its height and width must not be larger than the ones of its container.
Give some width to the inner div and add margin:0 auto; in the CSS property.
Add CSS to your inner div.
Set margin: 0 auto and set its width less than 100%, which is the width of the outer div.
That makes it the div center as wanted.
However since the inner div has by default width: 100% you have to set a specific width or use one of the following:
The usage is for the div you're centering.
The main attributes for centering the div are margin: auto and width: according to requirements:
This centralizes your inner div horizontally and vertically:
You can use display: flex for your outer div and to horizontally center you have to add justify-content: center
The outer div just needs to have display flex, and the inner needs margin: 0 auto to make it centered horizontally.
To center vertically and just center a div within another div, please look at the comments of the .inner class below
For using Flexbox you should give display: flex; and align-items: center; to your parent or #outer div element.
This should center your child or #inner div horizontally.
Because our #outer div has no height or in other words, its height is set to auto, so it has the same height as all of its child elements.
You can see #inner div is now centered.
For the normal thing if you are using div in a static way.
If you want a div to be centered when div is absolute to its parent, here is example:
For a horizontally centered DIV:
Center a div inside a div horizontally:
Center a div inside a div vertically:
And, to completely middle the div vertically and horizontally:
You can add another div which has the same size of #inner and move it to the left by -50% (half of the width of #inner) and #inner by 50%.
This is the best example to horizontally center a <div>
If you have a parent of some height say, body{height: 200px}
or like the below has parent div#outer with height 200px, then add CSS content as below
Then child content, say div#centered content, will be vertically or horizontally middle, without using any position CSS.
To add only a border to show the inner div is not 100% by default:
To align a div within a div in middle -
This will align the internal div in the middle, both vertically and horizontally.
will append a blank div to <div id="main"></div>
Technically $('<div></div>') will 'create' a div element (or more specifically a DIV DOM element) but won't add it to your HTML document.
This will create new div with id "new" into body.
I think this is the best way to add a div:
To append a test div to the div element with ID div_id:
Now append [HTML (hyper-link)] to this added test div:
Here's another technique for creating divs with jQuery.
Say you have an existing div in your page that you want to clone using jQuery (e.g.
But this syntax is better than $("<div></div>"), and it's a very good value for that money.
Firstly I am appending a list tag to my div tag and inserting JSON data into it.
If it is just an empty div, this is sufficient:
A short way of creating div is
Now the custom div  can be appended to any other div.
If you want an epmty div use it as $('<div></div>');.
Create an in-memory DIV
Here, pElement refers to the element you want this div inside (to be a child of!
You can easily add anything more to that div in the string - Attributes, Content, you name it.
In this example we used .frame img {} so that only images wrapped by a div with a class of .frame would be targeted.
I removed the image element altogether and set it as background of the div with a class of .frame
Div.frame is displayed as inline with this, so you need to wrap it in a block element.
I am not sure about Internet Explorer, but under Firefox and Chrome, if you have an img in a div container, the following CSS content should work.
Want to align an image which have after a text / title and both are inside a div?
Just be sure to have an ID or a class at all your elements (div, img, title, etc.
You can use table structure inside a div
You can control the location of the menu div which will be displayed within the header div with left margins and top positions.
You can also set the div menu to float right if you like.
By using a div with style z-index:1; and position: absolute; you can overlay your div on any other div.
z-index determines the order in which divs 'stack'.
A div with a higher z-index will appear in front of a div with a lower z-index.
In this case you can "wrap the wrapper" inside a container with display: block - usually a good and old div.
For example, if a <div class="parent"> element is given position: relative, any child elements use the <div class="parent"> as their position context.
If a child element were given position: absolute and top: 100px, the element would be positioned 100 pixels from the top of the <div class="parent"> element, because the <div class="parent"> is now the position context.
In this example, if the two <div> elements were positioned in the same place on the page, the <div>Top</div> element would cover the <div>Bottom</div> element.
Since <div>Top</div> comes after <div>Bottom</div> in the HTML structure it has a higher stacking order.
To do this, we'll wrap the .navi and #infoi elements in a new element <div class="wrapper"> so we can create a new position context.
Here is a simple example to bring an overlay effect with a loading icon over another div.
After that, you can set a div with the relative position to take full width and height
Inside this div with the relative position you can put your div with absolute positions
If the div where you want to put your element has content inside, and you want the element to show after the main content:
If the div where you want to put your element has content inside, and you want to show the element before the main content:
If the div where you want to put your element is empty, or you want to replace it entirely:
[http://html-tuts.com/move-div-in-another-div-with-jquery (hyper-link)]
So the OP's question could possibly be solved by this (that is, assuming the <div id="destination" /> does not yet exist, the following approach will create such a wrapper from scratch - the OP was not clear about whether the wrapper already exists or not):
It correctly wraps those <div>...</div> and <input>...</input> BUT SOMEHOW LEAVES OUT the <label>...</label>.
In order to make sure that the scroll works after the new data had been loaded into the div with the ng-repeat for messages, just wrap the scroll snippet in a timeout.
$("html,body").animate({scrollTop:$("#div-id")[0].offsetTop}, 1000);
which will result in a smooth scroll to the top of the div with id "div-id".
A very simple method to this is to set the scroll to to the height of the div.
Scroll to the last element inside the div:
The idea of scrolling to a particular div in the chat was the following
1) Each chat div consisting of Person, time and message is run in a for loop with class chatContentbox
I use the difference between the Y coordinate of the first item div and the Y coordinate of the selected item div.
As for absolutely positioning the img inside the div, you need to set the containing div to have a "known size" before this will work properly.
If you can get that to work, you might want to try progressively removing the height, width, position attributes from div.header to get the minimal required attributes to get the effect you want.
All of them need to be vertically aligned within the div
One of the images needs to be absolute positioned within the div.
Absolutely positioned relative to the DIV?
You might also find it beneficial to drop the DIV and move the images inside the H1 element - this provides semantic value to the container, and removes the need to adjust the display of the H1:
A one-cell table inside the div handles the vertical-align and is backward compatible back to the Stone Age!
Just use a one-cell table inside the div!
A one-cell table inside the div handles the vertical-align and is backward compatible back to the Stone Age!
This is my personal solution for an i element inside a div.
To position block elements to the center (works in [Internet Explorer 9 (hyper-link)] and above), it needs a wrapper div:
My trick is to put a table inside the div with one row and one column, set 100% of width and height, and the property vertical-align:middle:
The "a" element converted to a button, using Bootstrap classes, and it is now vertically centered inside an outer "div".
This solution works well with responsive div height and width as well.
I have found a new workaround to vertically align multiple text-lines in a div using CSS 3 (and I am also using bootstrap v3 grid system to beautify the UI), which is as below:
Then apply the following CSS content to wrap div or outdiv in my example:
div: class="container d-flex"
element inside div: class="m-auto"
Actually, you need two div's for vertical centering.
The div containing the content must have a width and height.
Also unfortunately, you'll need to use additional divs around the div you want vertically centered.
you need to set the outer div to be displayed as a table and the inner div to be displayed as a table-cell — which can then be vertically centered.
For Internet Explorer, you need to position the inner div absolutely within the outer div and then specify the top as 50%.
The Colors of the page background and its horizontal margins are defined in their corresponding divs.
To center the div on a page, [check the fiddle link (hyper-link)].
The answer from Billbad only works with a fixed width of the .inner div.
This solution works for a dynamic width by adding the attribute text-align: center to the .outer div.
The example below will center a div to the center within your browser.
Especially for parent divs with relative (unknown) height, the [centering in the unknown (hyper-link)] solution works great for me.
By using the transform property we can do a vertically centered div easily.
Just do it: Add the class at your div:
150 pixels because that's half of the div's height in this case.
'position' relative messes up the styling if the current div is in the body and has no container div.
Also I used this styling for centering some overlay divs and found that in Mozilla all elements inside this transformed div had lost their bottom borders.
The div's height and parent's height are dynamic.
This solution worked for me for a block element (e.g., <div>).
From: [Mozilla - Grid Documentation - Align Div Vertically (hyper-link)]
Since each time I need to center div vertically I google for it over and over again and this answer always comes first I'll leave this for future me (since none of the provided solutions fit my need well):
You could then place this all inside a div with a "video" class.
In order to do this, I put an image before the embedded object within the "video" class div.
Just create a wrapper <div> with a percentage value for padding-bottom, like this:
It will result in a <div> with height equal to 75% of the width of its container (a 4:3 aspect ratio).
Placing content in the div :
In order to keep the aspect ratio of the div and prevent its content from stretching it, you need to add an absolutely positioned child and stretch it to the edges of the wrapper with:
To add to Web_Designer's answer, the <div> will have a height (entirely made up of bottom padding) of 75% of the width of it's containing element.
If you want your div to be a width other than 100%, you need another wrapping div on which to set the width:
Ergo, a correct example of a responsive DIV that keeps a 16:9 aspect ratio is as follows:
So, if you need a div that is 30% of the viewport width, you can use 30vw instead, and since you know the width, you reuse them in height using calc and vw unit.
lets say you have 2 divs the outher div is a container and the inner could be any element that you need to keep its ratio (img or an youtube iframe or whatever )
The example makes the div's ratio 10:5
<div ratio="4x3"></div>
Uses pseudo elements instead of wrapper divs
I personally prefer the version where the <svg> is placed in markup, as I can have a single class (.ratio) dealing with containers of various ratios (as opposed to having a class for each individual ratio I might need).
Here is my solution for maintaining an 16:9 aspect ratio in portrait or landscape on a div with optional fixed margins.
Now we can put any content in our div, and the pseudo element is the one who determines the width/height ratio.
I just created a 2:1 div that resized to occupy the full width, but then shrinks the width if it would cause the top or bottom to exceed.
The people who say that an absolute div can't affect layout are wrong in this case because the parent grows in both height and or width, that parent can mess with your layouts even if the child doesn't directly.
I don't know if this is the source of frustration for everyone here but it is an easy mistake to make and even using dev-tools won't give you an accurate idea of of where the blowout is coming from in many cases since it isn't really a case of an individual element blowing it out but rather the grid layout enlarging itself to keep those fr units accurate vertically and horizontally.
The new aspect-ratio tag would be awesome, but it messed up the positioning of my divs.
The traditional solution of padding a wrapper div, works, but only adjusts the size according to the width of the parent or the viewport, which makes it problematic when the height is the limiting factor.
I just wanted to add if someone wants to do it with a single div tag then here is the way out:
Improved:    /// This makes the horizontal scrollbar not appear with large elements in the centered div.
Where "X" is half of the width of a div I want to display.
This is a trick I figured out for getting a DIV to float exactly in the center of a page.
You can place the image in a div and add a div id and have the CSS for that div have a text-align:center:
As such, this creates an equal space on all the four points of a div, which is always a box (has four sides).
[Flexbox (hyper-link)] can be used to center an absolute positioned div.
You can also create the middleware div#centered box centered with absolute, left and right properties and without width property and then set the main content div as its child with display:inline-block box and center it with text-align:center set for its middleware parent box
Assuming the element in the div, is another div...
The element (div) can also be any size (must be smaller than the container):
This will center all the objects inside div with position type static or relative.
Set the height of the header div.
I'm working on a site for a client, and the design requires the text to be at the bottom of a certain div.
The idea is both to display the div at the bottom and also making it stick there.
Often the simple approach will make the sticky div scroll up with the main content.
Note that there's no div embedding trickery required.
if you could set the height of the wrapping div of the content (#header-content as shown in other's reply), instead of the entire #header, maybe you can also try this approach:
Unlike relative+absolute solutions, the content doesn't float in its own layer (i.e., it embeds normally in the container div).
The solution just takes one <div>, which I call the "aligner":
This trick works by creating a tall, skinny div, which pushes the text baseline to the bottom of the container.
We can also do the same with margin-top:auto on the text but in this case we need to wrap it inside a div or span:
a very simple, one-line solution, is to add line-heigth to the div, having in mind that all the div's text will go bottom.
keep in mind that this is a practical and fast solution when you just want text inside div to go down, if you need to combine images and stuff, you will have to code a bit more complex and responsive CSS
To separate something from the rest of the content, insert an empty div and let it grow to fill the space.
You can use flex-grow: 1 on the first div.
This way, your second div will be aligned to the bottom while the first will cover all remaining space.
On the parent div, you must use display: flex and flex-direction: column.
The best possible solution to move a div to the bottom is as follows.
for innerdiv which do not specify it's height value,there is no pure css solution to make it vertically centered.a javascript solution could be get the innerdiv's offsetHeight,then calculate the style.marginTop.
Anyway thanks CSS3 you can easily vertically aligns div in div (example there [http://jsfiddle.net/mcSfe/98/ (hyper-link)])
Outer Div must set its position to relative or fixed, and the Inner Div must set its position to absolute, top and left to 50% and apply a transform: translate(-50%, -50%).
Width and hight of the outer div can be defined.
You can center the div vertically and horizontally in CSS using flex;
When your height is not set (auto); you can give inner div some padding (top and bottom) to make it vertically center:
We can use the calc() function to control the margin-top property of the child div when it's positioned absolute relative to the parent div.
The main advantage using calc() is that the parent element height can be changed at anytime and the child div will always be aligned to the middle.
I did something that should be able to be adapted to a div as well.
You can toggle a child div during onmouseover and onmouseout like this:
You could then create a tooltip-2 div the same way... you can of course also use the title attribute instead of data attribute.
The only thing you have to do is set an attribute on any div called "data-tooltip" and that text will be displayed next to it when you hover over it.
data-tooltip="bla bla" to your object (div or whatever):
[code snippet]
<div title="Great for making new friends through cooperation.
Simple most way to add tooltip to your div element.
<div style="width: <=% getTreeWidth() %>">Tree</div>
Just take that second div, remove the float, and give it overflow:hidden instead.
The net effect here is that the floated div will do its thing, then the second div will be an ordinary block, taking up all available width except that occupied by the float.
Two div panels(content+extra), side by side, content panel expands if extra panel is not present.
This will parse all children of the parent div and only update the right most child.
Notice that divs now expand to the full height as well, as required.
Use overflow-y: auto; on the div.
I had to have a fixed height for a parent div which i didn't want.
If you don't mind the navigation div being clipped in the event of an unexpectedly-short content div, there's at least one easy way:
The title speaks of a parent div, but the question makes it sound like you want two sibling divs (navigation and content) to be the same height.
and set the content div to have a left margin of whatever the width of the navigation pane is.
That way, the content's content is to the right of the navigation and you can set the navigation div to be 100% of the content's height.
EDIT: I'm doing this completely in my head, but you would probably also need to set the navigation div's left margin to a negative value or set it's absolute left to 0 to shove it back to the far left.
You can easily add a header onto this design by wrapping #container in another div, embedding the header div as #container's sibling, and moving the margin and width styles to the parent container.
on the children div
<section> marks up a [section (hyper-link)], <div> marks up a generic block with no associated semantics.
div is a generic tag for a section.
<div>, on the other hand, does not convey any meaning, aside from any found in its class, lang and title attributes.
So no: using a <div> does not define a section in HTML.
When an element is needed only for styling purposes or as a convenience for scripting, authors are encouraged to use the <div> element instead.
The <div> element has no special meaning at all.
Note: Authors are strongly encouraged to view the <div> element as an element of last resort, for when no other element is suitable.
Use of more appropriate elements instead of the <div> element leads to better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors.
([https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-div-element (hyper-link)])
<div>—the generic flow container we all know and love.
My suggestion: 
div: used lower version( i think 4.01 to still) html element(lot of designers handled that).
When using div instead of section the inner div h1-header is diplayed as h1.
<div>: The [HTML (hyper-link)]  element (or HTML Document Division Element) is the generic container for flow content, which does not inherently represent anything.

In that vein, a div is relevant only from a pure CSS or DOM perspective, whereas a section is relevant also for semantics and, in a near future, for indexing by search engines.
The <div> tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
The <div> tag is used to group block-elements to format them with CSS.
The <div> element is defined as a block of children elements.
Take caution not to overuse the section tag as a replacement for a div element.
Within the section tag, we should then continue to markup and control the content with HTML tags which are lower in the hierarchy, like h1, div, span, etc.
<div></div>
The HTML <div> element (or HTML Document Division Element) is the
  generic container for flow content, which does not inherently
  represent anything.

Using <section> may be neater, help screen readers and SEO while <div> is smaller in bytes and quicker to type
Also, would not recommend putting <section> in a <section>, instead place a <div> inside a <section>
<section> marks a widget in a graphical user interface, whereas <div> is the container of the components of a widget like a container holding a button, and a label etc.
If you only want to print this div, you must use the instruction:
<a href="javascript:void(processPrint('divID'));">Print</a> <-- passing the div ID to be printed on to the function to turn the printMe variable into the div ID.
printDiv(divId):  A generalized solution to print any div on any page.
My solution, thanks to much of the above, allows you to specify any div object to be printed.
The key for this solution is to add an appropriate rule to the the print media style sheet so that the requested div (and its contents) will be printed.
noprintarea allows you to suppress the printing of elements within your div- both the content and the block.
noprintcontent allows you to suppress the printing of elements within your div- the content is suppressed but and the allocated area is left empty.
The second (printDiv) activates the print media style sheet, then appends a new rule to allow the desired div to print, issues the print, and then adds a delay before the final housekeeping (otherwise the styles can be reset before the print is actually done.)
Then, from anywhere in your document, you can print a div.
Just issue printDiv("thedivid") from a button or whatever.
It also allows use of existing styles for elements that are printed - including the containing div.
Place your printable part inside a div with an id like this:
Then add an event like an onclick (as shown above), and pass the id of the div like I did above.
You can use this:
[http://vikku.info/codesnippets/javascript/print-div-content-print-only-the-content-of-an-html-element-and-not-the-whole-document/ (hyper-link)]
Step 2: Call the PrintMe('DivID') function by an onclick event.
The printDiv() function came out a few times, but in that case, you loose all your binding elements and input values.
So, my solution is to create a div for everything called "body_allin" and another one outside the first one called "body_print".
@Kevin Florida
If you have multiple divs with same class, you can use it like this:
I had multiple images each with a button and needed to click on a button to print each div with an image.
Here selector must be specific div selector which content we need to print.
The Best way to Print particular Div or any Element
Wrap everything you want to print in a div "printSource".
This solution is a hybrid of two categories: hide all content of <body>, then copy the content of the printable element to a new <div> and append it to <body>.
After printing, remove the newly added <div> and show the content of <body> back.
In my case, I build all may websites with three sections inside <body>: <header>, <footer>, and between them <div id="Content">.
There are two approaches to centering a column <div> in Bootstrap 3:
EDIT - As mentioned in the comments, center-block works on column contents and display:block elements, but won't work on the column itself (col-* divs) because Bootstrap uses float.
To center the content inside the div, use text-align:center,
And to center the div only on mobile version, use the below code.
You can use text-center for the row and can make sure the internal divs have display:inline-block (with not float).
Keep in mind, the second argument must be dividable by 12.
Wrap all columns in one div.
Make that div as a table with a fixed layout.
Here I have used col-lg-1, and the offset should be 10 for properly centered the div on large devices.
With Bootstrap v3 and v4, this can be accomplished just by adding .justify-content-center to the .row <div>
Use mx-auto in your div class using Bootstrap 4.
Add the line display: table-cell; to your CSS content for that div.
Only table cells support the vertical-align: middle;, but you can give that [table-cell] definition to the div...
Since they tend to be hacks or adding complicated divs...
Have a text inside a div tag and give it an id.
[code snippet]
Note: Make sure the line-height property is same as the height of the division.
Also, there will be times when you cannot specify the size of a division in px or % (when the division is really small and you want the content to be exactly in the middle).
[code snippet]
[Image (hyper-link)]
These 3 lines of code sets the content exactly in the middle of a division (irrespective of the size of the display).
Give this CSS class to the targeted <div>:
You can use the flex property at the parent div and add the margin:auto property to the children items:
Add the following code in the parent div
Without knowing the ID of the DIV I think you could select the IMG like this:
which would return all imgs that are descendants of the div
If your DIV tag is immediately followed by the IMG tag, you can also use:
You can find all img element of parent div like below
Your div contains only one img element.
But if your div contain more img element like below
And the below is if you don't have reference to $(this) and you want to reference img available within a div from other function.
When you click the DIV you get the image from some different methods, in this situation "this" is the DIV.
You may have 0 to many <img> tags inside of your <div>.
If your img is exactly first element inside div then try
My usual approach is to animate the height of an outer DIV which has a single child which is a style-less DIV used only for measuring the content height.
One would like to just be able to dispense with the .measuringWrapper and just set the DIV's height to auto and have that animate, but that doesn't seem to work (the height gets set, but no animation occurs).
This allows you to have a div that at first shows content up to 200px height and on hover it's size becomes at least as high as the whole content of the div.
The Div does not become 3000px but 3000px is the limit that I am imposing.
One could move the collapsable content into an inner div and calculate the max height by getting the height of the inner div (via JQuery it'd be the outerHeight()).
I got this working for an accordeon menu, with <h5>'s as the toggler expanding the <div> inside the <div>.
I've been using transform:translateY(y) to transform the list to the view ...
You can see more in the test 
[http://jsfiddle.net/BVEpc/4/ (hyper-link)] 
I've placed div behind every li because my drop down list are coming from up and to show them properly this was needed, my div code is:
I have a .child & a .parent div.
The child div fits perfectly within the parent's width/height with absolute positioning.
This div then masks out the .child div when it slides down.
The accepted answer works for most cases, but it doesn't work well when your div can vary greatly in height — the animation speed is not dependent on the actual height of the content, and it can look choppy.
The trick is to use a hidden & duplicated div to get the browser to understand what 100% means.
Simultaneously, you can add transition for height individually or just you all.
float shrink-wrapping, (necessitating an extra div to apply the float clearing hack)
I wanted to have a div slide open/close not just vertically, but also horizontally, so it effectively slides open from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.
The transition works also after resizing the containing div (either be it through a window resize or programmatically)
the content div is vertically auto-scrolled when the width gets too small (but doesn't do this during transition
Wrapping all td contents into div and use height: 0 + overflow:
hidden + white-space: nowrap on divs , and the animation/transition
of your choice
Best cross browser solution (mostly for IE support) like @Steve said is to make a div 98px in width and height than add a border 1px around it, or you could make a background image for div 100x100 px and draw a border on it.
So let's say you have a black 100px x 100px div and you need to inset it with a white border - which has an inner offset of 5px (say) - this can still be done with the above properties.
You can look at outline with offset but this needs some padding to exists on your div.
Or you can absolutely position a border div inside, something like
You might need to fiddle with margins on the fake borders div to fit it as you like.
Instead of listening to every single click on the DOM to hide one specific element, you could set tabindex to the parent <div> and listen to the focusout events.
Setting tabindex will make sure that the blur event is fired on the <div> (normally it wouldn't).
I read some answers here a while back and created some code I use for div's that function as popup bubbles.
If you want another item or div to be clickable when the screenmask is active, just assign a higher z-index to that item or div.
The CSS just sizes the <div>, vertically center aligns the <span> by setting the <div>'s line-height equal to its height, and makes the <span> an inline-block with vertical-align: middle.
<div id="box"></div>
For example,
<div id="box"><span>TextContent</span></div>.
You might have to play with that number, but it will be in the center of the surrounding div.
Don't set the height attribute of the div, but instead use padding: to achieve the effect.
Although this way, if you have more content, the text will still be centered, but the div itself will be slightly larger.
This will set the top and bottom padding of the div to 60px, and the left and right padding to zero, making the div 120 pixels (plus the height of your font) high, and placing the text vertically centered in the div.
I would just like to extend [the answer from Michielvoo (hyper-link)] in order to release need for line-height and breathing of div height.
NOTE: commented out part of cssis needed for fixed-height of enclosing div.
The solution accepted as the answer is perfect to use line-height the same as the height of div, but this solution does not work perfectly when text is wrapped OR is in two lines.
Try this one if text is wrapped or is on multiple lines inside a div.
The key is to use style = "top: calc(50% - [innerFixedHeightInPX/2]px); height: [innerFixedHeightInPX]px;" inside an absolute or relatively positioned parent div.
Set it within button instead of div if you don't care about its little visual 3D effect.
You have to use table style for the div and center align for the content.
The following code will put the div in the middle of the screen regardless of screen size or div size:
Setting auto as the margin on all four sides however causes opposite margins to be equal and displays our child div in the center of the parent div.
Unfortunately the above won’t work in Internet Explorer 7 and below, and like the previous method the content inside the child div can grow too large, causing it to be hidden.
Although the code isn't perfectly semantic, I think it's more straightforward to have what I call a "clearing div" at the bottom of every container with floats in it.
​With a little CSS targeting, you don't even need to add a class to the parent DIV.
This example and what I was working on when I came across this page both use floated divs in much exactly the same way that a span would be used.
Instead of using divs, switch to span, or if you are using another element which is by default 'display: block' instead of 'display: inline' then change it to be 'display: inline'.
If you use this approach you probably want to set the div to be height: 0px.
add this in the parent div at the bottom
Of course the outer span could be a div or what have you.
CSS (make the table item always fit to the box div):
To scale the background image to fit inside the div:
To scale the background image to cover the whole div:
I don't know your div-values, but let's assume you've got those.
It could quite hard to make the background-image (if you would want to) with a fixed width for the div, so better use max-width.
And actually it isn't complicated to fill a div with an background-image, just make sure you style the parent element the right way, so the image has a place it can go into.
If what you need is the image to have the same dimensions of the div, I think this is the most elegant solution:
You said you specified the height to 800 pixels, and wanted the div not to stretch when the width was greater than that...
#middlecontainer is div with content of your site; it's width 102px.
In case the width of content is known, you need to divide the page's size to 2, and subtract half of content's width from the result:
1200 / 2 - (102 / 2) = 549;
Some other pre-existing setups from older code that will prevent div page centering L&R are:
Legend code with IDs and/or CLASSES will conflict with a named div class.
position: absolute and then top:50% and left:50% places the top edge at the vertical center of the screen, and the left edge at the horizontal center, then by adding margin-top to the negative of the height of the div, i.e., -100 shifts it above by 100 and similarly for margin-left.
This gets the div exactly in the center of the page.
Div centered vertically and horizontally inside the parent without fixing the content size
Centering without specifying div width:
Add this class to the div you want centered (which should have a set width):
Or, add the margin stuff to your div class, like this:
/* it brings div to center   */
If your center content is deep inside other divs then only margin can save you.
Use justify-content and align-items to horizontally and vertically align a div
Use the below code for centering the div box:
JavaScript (before you need to show this DIV)
If page includes - at least- any "DIV", the function given by meouw throws the "Y" value beyond current page limits.
Get position of div in respect to left and Top
With that CSS, put your divs like so (floats first):
You often want last inside #container this snippet: <div style="clear:both;"></div> which will extend #container vertically to contain both side floats instead of taking its height only from #center and possibly allowing the sides to protrude out the bottom.
Make sure the image is enclosed within a div (#center in this case).
Lastly, you need to clear the floats all up so that it doesn't mess with future <div>.
Here is a CSS3 method for aligning divs horizontally inside another div.
In all cases, the three divs are on the same line.
Using [Bootstrap 3 (hyper-link)] I create 3 divs of equal width (in 12 column layout 4 columns for each div).
Also, if there's stipulations with using position:absolute; or position:relative;, you can always try padding parent div or putting a margin-top:x;.
Div of style, position:absolute;bottom:5px;width:100%; is working, 
But it required more scrollup situation.
Placing the copyright-div after the container-div
You would only have to format the copyright-div in a similar way to the other container (same overall width, centering, etc.
The only time this might not be ideal is when your container-div is declared with height:100%, and the user would need to scroll down to see the copyright.
Aside: I know the OP asked for a solution that "... sticks to the bottom of the 'container' div ...", and not something under it, but come on, people are looking for good solutions here, and this is one!
Create another container div for the elements above #copyright.
Just above copyright add a new div:
   <div style="clear:both;"></div>
It will force the footer to be under everything else, just like in the case of using relative positioning (bottom:0px;).
Because normal flow is 'top-to-bottom' we can't simply ask the #copyright div to stick to the bottom of his parent without absolutely positioning of some sort, But if we wanted the #copyright div to stick to the top of his parent, it will be very simple - because this is the normal flow way.
we will change the order of the divs in the HTML, now the #copyright div is at the top, and the content follow it right away.
we also make the content div stretch all the way (using pseudo elements and clearing techniques)
Maybe this helps someone: You can always place the div outside the other div and then push it upwards using negative margin:
For those only have one child in the container, you can use the table-cell and vertical-align approach which worked reliably for positioning a single div at the bottom of its parent.
Use Canvas when you have to do bitmap image manipulation and use a regular div when you want to manipulate stuff created in HTML.
DIVs are okay but clunky and have awful performance loading at large numbers.
I've run a bunch of numbers on HTML DIV-made drawing versus Canvas-made drawing.
I made Canvas and HTML DIV test pages, both had movable "nodes."
HTML nodes were movable Divs.
There is no doubt you could get Canvas to be faster at object manipulation as the divs in that simple test, and of course far faster in the load time.
HTML Divs are clunky and do not scale, making a circle is only possible with rounded corners, making complex shapes is possible but involves hundreds of tiny tiny pixel-wide divs.
Just my 2 cents regarding the divs option.
Famous/Infamous and SamsaraJS (and possibly others) use absolutely positioned non-nested divs (with non-trivial HTML/CSS content), combined with matrix2d/matrix3d for positioning and 2D/3D transformations, and achieve a stable 60FPS on moderate mobile hardware, so I'd argue against divs being a slow option.
Incase someone wants to postion a child div directly under a parent
You can do this easily with a div by giving it the style word-wrap: break-word (and you may need to set its width, too).
Your .flex-item elements should be block level (div instead of span) if you want the height and top/bottom padding to work properly.
In both cases the height of the centered divs can be variable, undefined, unknown, whatever.
The height of the centered divs doesn't matter.
The align-content property aligns a flex container’s lines within the
  flex container when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to
  how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis.
1 - Set CSS on parent div to display: flex;
2 - Set CSS on parent div to flex-direction: column; Note that this will make all content within that div line up top to bottom.
This will work best if the parent div only contains the child and nothing else.
3 - Set CSS on parent div to justify-content: center;
where flex-container div is used to center vertically and horizontally your rows div, and rows div is used to group your "items" and ordering them in a column based one.
For example, the checked property is a Boolean, the style property is an object with individual properties for each style, the size property is a number.
Put the picture inside a newDiv.
Make the width of the containing div the same as the image.
Apply margin: 0 auto; to the newDiv.
That should center the div within the container.
With zoom to the center of the image (image fills the div):
Without zoom to the center of the image (image does not fill the div):
If you have to do this inline (such as when using an input box),
here is a quick hack that worked for me:  surround your (image link in this case)
in a div with style="text-align:center"
Why you don't use CSS for centering a div?
I used this to center  Div element.
If i have a div with id "test" to center then the following script would center the div in the window on document ready.
The following code centers a div both horizontally and vertically inside its container :
It centralize your inner div horizontally and vertically.
Just say:
$("#divID").html($('').html($("#divID").html()));
Here, use [CSS Flex box (hyper-link)] property to align the div center.
Basically what you do is make both divs/columns very tall by adding a padding-bottom: 100% and then "trick the browser" into thinking they aren't that tall using margin-bottom: -100%.
You can use Jquery's Equal Heights Plugin to accomplish, this plugins makes all the div of exact same height as other.
Basically it uses a background image in a containing DIV to simulate the two equal-height-DIVs.
.mydivclass {inline-block; vertical-align: middle; width: 33%;}
If you don't mind one of the divs being a master and dictating the height for both divs there is this:
No matter what, the div on the right will expand or squish&overflow to match the height of the div on the left.
Both divs must be immediate children of a container, and have to specify their widths within it.
Just add the following CSS to the father <div>, it will work.
The modern way of doing this (which also avoids having to declare a <div class="row"></div>-wrapper around every two items) would be to make use of a CSS grid.
Say you have a container with two divs inside and you want those two divs to have the same height.
Then just give the child divs a 'min-height' of 100%
I just wanted to add to the great Flexbox solution described by Pavlo, that, in my case, I had two lists/columns of data that I wanted to display side-by-side with just a little spacing between, horizontally-centered inside an enclosing div.
By nesting another div within the first (leftmost) flex:1 div and floating it right, I got just what I wanted.
Then you can set your div to be
Your diagram shows a block level element also (which a div usually is), not an inline one.
In IE6 you will need to add another outer div:
In the case of a non-fixed width div (i.e.
you don't know how much space the div will occupy).
Keep in mind that the width of #yourdiv is dynamic -> it will grow and shrink to accommodate the text inside it.
The best response to this question is to use margin-auto but for using it you must know the width of your div in px or %.
If your <div> has position: absolute you need to use width: 100%;
I assume that your div has no margins or paddings here, but they are relatively easy to account for.
Position the div relative to its container;
Position the div's left boundary at 50% of its container width horizontally;
Translate back horizontally by 50% of the div's own width.
It is easy to imagine this process to confirm that the div would be horizontally centered eventually.
The advantage of this approach is that you don't have to do any counterintuitive stuff, such as considering your div a text of sorts, wrapping it in a (often semantically useless) additional container, or giving it a fixed width, which is not always possible.
I use div and span tags together with css properties such as block, cross-browser inline-block and text-align center, see my simple example
Please use the below code and your div will be in the center.
Use <center></center> tags as a wrap around your <div></div>.
If you know the width of your div and it is fixed, you can use the following css:
where 'half-of-your-div-width' should be (obviously) the half of the width of your div.
The best way to do it would be to submit the contents of the div to the server and open a new window where the server could put those contents into the new window.
If that's not an option you can try to use a client-side language like javascript to hide everything on the page except that div and then print the page...
Open the document object of the new window and write into it a simple document containing nothing but the div you've got and necessary html header etc - you may also want to have the document pull in a stylesheet, depending on your content is
Make your div to print cover the entire document, but only when it's printed:
This will print the div area you want and set the content back to as it was.
printdivname is the div to be printed.
The CSS media query solutions assume there is only one div to print.
Can print any number of DIV's on a page.

I've tried many approaches but only this one works for multiple inline elements inside a container div.
Here is code to align everything in div at middle.
A simple way would be creating separate styles for both the div and the image and then position them independently.
This worked for me when you have to center align image and your parent div to image has covers whole screen.
Just set parent div css property "text-align:center;"
for a long time, i also tried the solution to put the img at the center of the div, but for my case i just need this type of component on ajax loading progress so i simply tried the following solution, hope this helps for you!
I just added float:left to div and it worked
Lets say we have the following div:
This is a simple div.
Div has dimensions 150 x 150 pixels with the border 50 pixels.
Now I just changed the height & width of div from 150 pixels to zero.
Note 3 : the HTML for the following explanation is always : <div class="tr"></div>
In the following image, the div has a golden yellow border.
In that div, insert a pseudo element and give it 100% width and height of parent.
To hide the unwanted parts of the pseudo element (everything that overflows the div with the yellow border) you just need to set overflow:hidden; on the container.
To make it easy, we will consider that the width of our div is known and the height is big enough to be able to draw our triangle inside (height >= width).
We have our two gradient g1 and g2, the blue line is the width of the div w and each gradient will have 50% of it (w/2) and each side of the triangle sould be equal to w. The green line is the height of both gradient hg and we can easily obtain the formula below:
Another way is to control the height of div and keep the syntax of gradient easy:
clip-path has the best result for me - works great for divs/containers with and without fixed dimensions:
and within the callback function you can check the new width of your div calling
So, the answer to your question is no, you can't bind the resize event to a div.
Only Window.onResize exists in the specification, but you can always utilize IFrame to generate new Window object inside your DIV.
i thought it couldn't be done but then i thought about it, you can manually resize a div via style="resize: both;" in order to do that you ave to click on it so added an onclick function to check  element's height and width and it worked.
(run the code snippet and click full page link to trigger the alert that the div is resized if you want to test it.
But then again this is for just one div, if you would like to do this for a large amount of elements then yes it could be very CPU hungry.
You could always use a click event to stop the div-resize sniffing anyway.
The way it works is by making two invisible divs fill the element you're watching, and then putting a trigger in each, and setting a scroll position that will lead to triggering a scroll change if the size changes.
Instead, you can use  [DOM mutation observers (hyper-link)] for listening to Div size change.
[Here's (hyper-link)] the fiddle
Try to change the div size.
debounce will trigger your method every x milliseconds instead of triggering every millisecond the DIV is being resized.
In the below example, I'm tracking the inner (green) div's width changes.
Dragging the slider affects the wrapper (gray) div's width.
You can see that the observable only fires when the inner div's width changes, which only happens if the outer div's width is smaller than 400px.
I would set your larger div with position:relative; then for your image do this:
This only works because you know the dimensions of both the image and the containing div.
This will also let you have other items within the containing div... where solutions like using line-height will not.
in the div
This would work regardless of you knowing the div's height or not.
If you know the size of the parent div and the image, you can just use absolute positioning.
Personally, I'd place it as the background image within the div, the CSS for that being:
(Assumes a div with id="demo" as you are already specifying height and width adding a background shouldn't be an issue)
I have a gallery of images for which I don't know the exact heights or widths of images beforhand, I just know that they are smaller than the div in which they are going to be contained.
This is coming a bit late, but here's a solution I use to vertical align elements within a parent div.
This is useful for when you know the size of the container div, but not that of the contained image.
I had this issue in HTML5 using CSS3 and my image was centered as such within the DIV... oh yes, I can't forget how I had to add the height to show the image... for a while I wondered where it was until I did this.
Just set the following rules on the container div:
BTW: This works for centering BIGGER divs inside SMALLER divs as well.
The code calculates the height of the tallest div and sets the other divs to the same height.
I don't believe height:100% will work, so if you don't explicitly know the div heights I don't think there is a pure CSS solution.
You're dealing with columns; divs + floats simply aren't the best way to do that (not to mention the fact that multiple levels of nested divs just to hack around css limitations is hardly more "semantic" than just using a simple table).
Relevant html: (the absence of spaces between the div tags is significant!)
Please set parent div to overflow: hidden
then in child divs you can set a large amount for padding-bottom.
for example
padding-bottom: 5000px
then margin-bottom: -5000px
and then all child divs will be the height of the parent.
Of course this wont work if you are trying to put content in the parent div (outside of other divs that is)
You could float the child-right to the right, but in this case I've calculated the widths of each div precisely.
If you are aware of bootstrap you can do it easily by using 'flex' property.All you need to do is pass below css properties to parent div
where .homepageSection is my parent div.
Now add child div in your html as
where abc is my child div.You can check equality of height in both child div irrespective of border just by giving border to child div
Here's what I found at [w3schools (hyper-link)], assuming the div has a height and/or width set.
It return given height only(must have manual height eg: <div style="height:12px"></div> otherwise it return empty result
But, your div would be clickable.
You can't make the div a link itself, but you can make an <a> tag act as a block, the same behaviour a <div> has.
Furthermore, using onclick does not provide the semantic information for a screen reader to determine that the div is functioning as a link.
While I don't recommend doing this under any circumstance, here is some code that makes a DIV into a link (note: this example uses jQuery and certain markup is removed for simplicity):
This post is Old I know but I just had to fix the same issue because simply writing  a normal link tag with the display set to block does not make the whole div clickable in IE.
Firstly let us understand why this happens: IE wont make an empty div clickable it only make the text/image within that div/a tag clickable.
Solution: Fill the div with a bakground image and hide it from the viewer.
And there you have it the whole div is now clickable.
The OP wants to make a div full of content behave like a link.
Then all you have to do is add cursor styles to the div
For bonus points only apply these styles if javascript is enabled by adding a 'js_enabled' class to the div, or the body, or whatever.
IE will not honour z-index if the element is has no background-color, so the link will not overlap parts of the containig div that has content, only the blank parts.
Say, this is the div block I want to make clickable:
Just consider the div block as a normal html element and enable the usual a href tag.
You can give a link to your div by following method:
div) with a data-link tag:
Now you can style the div however you want.
As proposed at [http://www.digitalskydesign.com/how-to-make-an-entire-div-a-link-using-css/ (hyper-link)]
but there is a tricky way to achieve this using a CSS code
you must nest an anchor tag inside your div tag and you must apply this property to it,
when you've done that,it will make the whole width area clickable (but within the height of the anchor tag),if you want to cover the whole div area you must set the height of the anchor tag exactly to the height of the div tag,for example:
use <a href="bla"> <div></div> </a> works fine in HTML5
This adds an invisible element (the span), which covers your entire div, and is above your whole div on the z-index, so when someone clicks on that div, the click is essentially intercepted by your invisible "span" layer, which is linked.
[Disable And Enable Input Elements In A Div Block Using jQuery (hyper-link)] should help you!
The disabled attribute is not part of the W3C spec for [DIV elements (hyper-link)], only for [form elements (hyper-link)].
Another way, in jQuery, would be to get the inner height, inner width and positioning of the containing DIV, and simply overlay another DIV, transparent, over the top the same size.
Remember though, with JS disabled, you'll still be able to use the DIVs inputs/content.
< div > can be disabled in IE8/9.
$("#myDiv").filter("input,textarea,select,button").prop("disabled", true) is more explicit and will catch some form elements you would miss with :input
You have to simulate above behavior for HTML elements that don't support 'disabled' attribute like div, if you wish.
If you have a div, and you want to support click or a key event on that div, then you have to do two things:
1) When you want to disable the div, set its disabled attribute as usual (just to comply with the convention)
2) In your div's click and/or key handlers, check if disabled attribute is set on the div.
If disabled attribute is not set, then do your div's click and/or key event logic.
A simple way to disable any DIV including its contents is to just disable mouse interaction.
This css only/noscript solution adds an overlay above a fieldset (or a div or any other element), preventing interaction:
The CSS pointer-events property alone doesn't disable child elements from scrolling, and it's not supported by IE10 and under for DIV elements (only for SVG).

If you are simply trying to stop people clicking and are not horrifically worried about security - I have found an absolute placed div with a z-index of 99999 sorts it fine.
You can't click or access any of the content because the div is placed over it.
the fieldsetUserInfo is div contains all inputs I want to disabled or Enable
Here is a quick comment for people who don't need a div but just a blockelement.
One way to achieve this is by adding the disabled prop to all children of the div.
$("#myDiv") finds the div, .find("*") gets you all child nodes in all levels and .prop('disabled', true) disables each one.
the benefit here is that you're not working with classes on the div that you want to work with
Wrap the div within a fieldset tag:
As many answers already clarified disabled is not a DIV attribute.
.myDiv[disabled] {...} Also can apply value filter e.g.
: following HTML disabling standard attribute with value div[disabled=disabled] {...}.
You can make a div that contains both the form & the button, then make the div float to the right by setting float: right;.
I'd prefer using the following on the inner div:
I know this is an old post but couldn't you just use <div id=xyz align="right"> for right.
Other answers for this question are not so good since float:right can go outside of a parent div (overflow: hidden for parent sometimes might help) and margin-left: auto, margin-right: 0 for me didn't work in complex nested divs (I didn't investigate why).
If you have multiple divs that you want aligned side by side at the right end of the parent div, set text-align: right; on the parent div.
This worked for us because all Ajax calls always returned HTML inside a DIV element that we use to replace a piece of the page.
If it was loaded in a div on the main page, it will redirect til the login page.
"#site" is a id of a div which is located on all pages except login page.
To prevent form displaying the response in div you can simply do some kind of ajax response filter for incomming responses with $.ajaxSetup.
first, give the div an id.

YAHOO.util.Dom.addClass('div1','className');
I also did the same thing for the second children of a specific div in my DOM as you can see in the code where I used $('#deals-index > div:eq(0) > div:eq(1)').addClass('doubleheaderredesign');.
You'd need to make sure that the wrapper div allows for the floating in terms of width, and margins etc are set correctly.
Float one or both inner divs.
Floating one div:
or if you float both, you'll need to encourage the wrapper div to contain both the floated children, or it will think it's empty and not put the border around them
Floating both divs:
Having two divs,
If div1 exceeds a certain height, div2 will be placed next to div1 at the bottom.
To solve this, use vertical-align:top; on div2.
Use float:left on both div elements and set a % width for both div elements with a combined total width of 100%.
Use box-sizing: border-box; on the floating div elements.
Use clearfix on the <div id="wrapper"> to clear the floating child elements which will make the wrapper div scale to the correct height.
Add position:relative to <div id="wrapper"> element to make child elements absolutely position to the <div id="wrapper"> element.
Use display:inline-block on both div elements and set a % width for both div elements with a combined total width of 100%.
And again (same as float:left example) use box-sizing: border-box; on the div elements.
Try to use below code changes to place two divs in front of each other
Add float:left; property in both divs.
Add display:flex; property  in parent div.
Tutorial, Demo, and Source code can be found from here - [Smooth scroll to div using jQuery (hyper-link)]
Here is my solution to smooth scroll to div / anchor using jQuery in case you have a fixed header so that it doesn't scroll underneath it.
Just replace ".site-header" to div that contains your header.
If you're going to go to the effort of making <a> block, why not put <a> inside the div, being a block element it'll give you the same effect.
You should either just keep the anchor tag as a block level element with no inner div, or put the div on the outside.
You can't put <div> inside <a> - it's not valid (X)HTML.
A <div> is a [block element (hyper-link)], so it may not appear inside an <a>.
I think that most of the time when people ask this question, they have build a site with only divs, and now one of the div needs to be a link.
I seen someone use a transparent empty image, PNG, inside an anchor tag just to make a link inside a div, and the image was the same size as the div.
If your goal is to make your div clickable you can use jQuery / Java Script.
Define your div like so:
This would also work for multiple divs - as per Tom's comment in this thread
So now it's perfectly appropriate to put a 'div' or 'h1' inside of an 'a' element.
Block level elements like <div> can be wrapped by <a> tags in HTML5.
Although a <div> is considered to be a [container/wrapper for flow content (hyper-link)] and <a>'s are considered [flow content (hyper-link)] according to [MDN (hyper-link)].
If you want to avoid the semantic trouble of placing divs inside anchor tags, just place the anchor tag on the same level as the divs, wrap them all with a container with position: relative, make your anchor tag position: absolute and expand it to fill the container.
The following example will hide all .testimonial divs containing the word "something":
When we want to access those divs which has data-index greater than 2 then we need this jquery.
<div> is a block-level element and <span> is an inline element.
If you wanted to do something with some inline text, <span> is the way to go since it will not introduce line breaks that a <div> would.
As noted by others, there are some semantics implied with each of these, most significantly the fact that a <div> implies a logical division in the document, akin to maybe a section of a document or something, a la:
div is a [block element (hyper-link)]
This means that to use them semantically, divs should be used to wrap sections of a document, while spans should be used to wrap small portions of text, images, etc.
The above is still illegal, as <span> only accepts phrasing content, and <div> is flow content.
Since this is a section, I use a div (with an appropriate id).
The userbar, being a section, is wrapped in a div.
As mentioned in other answers, by default div will be rendered as a block element, while span will be rendered inline within its context.
Using styles, you can make a div act like a span and vice-versa.
One of the useful styles for div is inline-block
[http://dustwell.com/div-span-inline-block.html (hyper-link)]
To wrap block-level elements, another block-level element must be used (such as <div>).
On the other hand, <div> may only be used in places where block-level elements are legal.
However, a fast definition would be that div is for dividing sections and span is for applying some kind of style to an element within another block element like div.
For this reason, they added two more elements to HTML: the generic, or meaningless elements <div> and <span>, because otherwise, people would go back to abusing the elements which do have meanings.
Div is a block element and span is an inline element and its width depends upon the content of it self where div does not
<div> is a block tag, while <span> is an inline tag.
When there is no suitable tag available in HTML as shown above, the <div> and <span> tags are usually resorted to.
The <div> tag is used to identify a blocklevel section/division of a document that has a line break both before and after it.
Examples of where div tags can be used are headers, footers, navigations etc.
The <span> tag is used to identify an inline section/division of a document.
That shows that not only should a div not be used inline, it simply won't produce the desired affect.
Just wanted to add some historical context to how there came to be span vs div
History of div:
DIV elements can be used to structure HTML documents as a hierarchy of divisions.
CENTER was introduced by Netscape before they added support for the
  HTML 3.0 DIV element.
Div was proposed as a generic way to divide pages and had the added benefit of replacing the <center> tag for center-aligning content.
Div has always been a block element because of its history as a page divider.
Span has always been an inline element because its original purpose was text styling and today div and span have both arrived at being generic elements with default block and inline display properties respectively.
DIV tag functionality as said can only be visible backed with styling, can have hold of large chunks of HTML code.
DIV is Block level
use of div affects the layout, the content inside appears in the new line(block element), when the element you wanna add has no special semantic meaning and you want it to appear in new line use <div>.
For aligning within a flexbox div or row...
The negative margins will let the content flow out of the Parent DIV.
Therefore I set the padding: 0 100%; to push the content back to the original boundaries of the Chlid DIV.
The negative margins will also make the .child-div's total width expands out of the browser's viewport, resulting in a horizontal scroll.
Hence we need to clip the extruding width by applying an overflow-x: hidden to a Grandparent DIV (which is the parent of the Parent Div):
This also may resolve your issue where the Parent DIV element has to be position:relative
The left and right border of the Child DIV will never show, simply because they are outside of the browser's viewport.
To make child div as wide as the content, try this:
I made a codePen to show the results : I used a parent div with a background image, and a child divon div with inner content.
This will calculate the ScrollTop Position from the height of #yourDivID using the $(document).height() property so that even if dynamic contents are added to the div the scroller will always be at the bottom position.
You can set scrollTop = scrollHeight - clientHeight, but that will keep the div in position when another element is added, aka the "keep itself at bottom" feature is not working anymore.
My div height is 650px.
The trick is to calculate: (a) current div user scroll position and (b) div scroll height, both BEFORE appending the new element.
Make the outer div position="relative" and the inner div position="absolute" and set it's bottom="0".
But because the inner div is positioned absolutely, you'll always have to worry about other content in the outer div overlapping it (and you'll always have to set fixed heights).
If you can do it, it's better to make that inner div the last DOM object in your outer div and have it set to "clear: both".
Situation :
I had to do the same thign only i was not able to add any extra divs, therefore i was stuck with what i had and rather than removing innerHTML and creating another via javascript almost like 2 renders i needed to have the content at the bottom (animated bar).
Here is way to avoid absolute divs and tables if you know parent's height:
$("<div/>",{ id: "yourId", class: "yourClass", html: "<span></span>" }).on("click", function(e) { alert($(this).prop("id")); }).appendTo("#something");
Using something like self-clearing div is perfect for a situation like [this (hyper-link)].
Try to set padding value more then 0, if child divs have margin-top or margin-bottom you can replace it with padding
I made a parent div expand around content of a child div by having the child div as a single column that does not have any positioning attribute such as absolute  specified.
Based on maincolumn div being the deepest child div of #wrap this defines the depth of the #wrap div and the 200px padding on either side creates two big blank columns for you to place absolutely positioned divs in as you please.
You could even change the padding top and bottom to place header divs and footer divs using position:absolute.
To the css of the parent div, or add a div at the bottom of the parent div that does clear:both;
An alternative answer is [How to make div not larger than its contents?
This may not always be practical, because floating your parent div may affect other parts of your page layout.
Method #3: Add Clearing Div Below Floated Elements

This solution is pretty bulletproof for older browsers and newer browsers alike.

There is no native event you can hook into for this however you can trigger an event from your script after you have made the div visible using the .
Then everytime the contentDiv is visible, "do something" will be alerted!
I change between modules showing and hiding divs parents.
The following code (pulled from [http://maximeparmentier.com/2012/11/06/bind-show-hide-events-with-jquery/ (hyper-link)]) will enable you to use $('#someDiv').on('show', someFunc);.
You can then use it to watch the div using:
If element with class div1 is visible, it sets div2 to be visible.
some div is 'display: flex' by default, but you'll set 'display: block' by mistake with display: invisible ?
Give the first div float: left; and a fixed width, and give the second div width: 100%; and float: left;.
Using [CSS display property (hyper-link)] - which can be used to make divs act like a table:
If you're not tagetting IE6, then float the second <div> and give it a margin equal to (or maybe a little bigger than) the first <div>'s fixed width.
The margin accounts for the possibility that the 'rest-of-space' <div> may contain more content than the 'fixed-width' <div>.
Simply define the width of the first div, and then give the second a flex-grow value of 1 which will allow it to fill the remaining width of the parent.
I don't know much about HTML and CSS design strategies, but if you're looking for something simple and that will fit the screen automatically (as I am) I believe the most straight forward solution is to make the divs behave as words in a paragraph.
You might or might not need to specify the width of the DIVs
Having read above that svg is inline by default, I just added the following to the div:
Put your code in between this div if you are using bootstrap:
And add the .container class to the div which contains your svg.
Put this two lines in style.css
In your specified div class.
Basically you need to make the two divs act like table cells.
So instead of using float:left, you'll have to use display:table-cell on both divs, and for the dynamic width div you need to set width:auto; also.
The both divs should be placed into a 100% width container with the display:table property.
IMPORTANT:For Internet Explorer you need to specify the float property on the dynamic width div, otherwise the space will not be filled.
Then, to use Boushley's solution, I'd like to add that you should place a div such as the following:
    .fakeFloat
    {
       height: 100%;
       width: 100%;
       float: left;
    }
and place this directly within the expanded div; all the expanded div's contents should go then within this fakeFloat element.
Although the common philosophy now is "use DIV instead of TABLE", I found in my case using TABLE worked much better.
The right div takes the entire width of the browser; the content takes the expected width.
This gives you the correct width for both the content and the div.
The solution is for a fixed center div and liquid side columns.
If you are trying to fill remaining space in a flexbox between 2 items, add the following class to a an empty div between the 2 you want to seperate:
Try max-content; property for div inside for spreading div in container:
Simplest solution is to just make the left div width equal 100% - the width of the right div plus any margin between them.
If anyone needs the same solution but without the fixed length of left div:
If you want the left side div to take all the space it needs you can remove the fixed size 180px.
See here in JSFiddle: [jsfiddle-div-space (hyper-link)]
HTML5 allows anchor elements to wrap almost anything, so in that case the div element can be made a child of the anchor.
(Note the '>') You can contain the whole thing in an a tag, then, as long as your trigger (which can be in it's own div, or straight up in the a tag, or anything you want) is physically touching the revealed div, you can move your mouse from one to the other.
Maybe this isn't useful for a great deal, but I had to set my revealed div to overflow: auto, so sometimes it had scroll bars, which couldn't be used as soon as you move away from the div.
In fact, after finally working out how to make the revealed div, (although it is now a child of the trigger, not a sibling), sit behind the trigger, in terms of z-index, (with a little help from this page: [How to get a parent element to appear above child (hyper-link)]) you don't even have to roll over the revealed div to scroll it, just stay hovering over the trigger and use your wheel, or whatever.
My revealed div covers most of the page, so this technique makes it a lot more permanent, rather than the screen flashing from one state to another with every move of the mouse.
For me, if I want to interact with the hidden div without seeing it disappear each time I leave the triggering element (a in that case) I must add:
Because the position of the div.popup is set to fixed (would also work with absolute) the content is not inside the normal flow of the document which allows the visible attribute to work well.
z-index is set to ensure that the div.popup appears above the other page elements.
This code only supports hovering over the div.information element.
To support hovering over both the div.information and div.popup then see Hover Over The Popup below.
And second, adjust the position of div.popup so that there is an overlap with div.information.
A few pixels is sufficient to ensure that the div.popup is can receive the hover when moving the cusor off div.information.
So if there is a div between the hover target and the hidden div, then it will not work.
[CodePen :hover on div show text in another div (hyper-link)]
The other solutions here don't actually work for divs with lots of content -- it "maxes out" scrolling down to the height of the div (instead of the height of the content of the div).
So they'll work, unless you have more than double the div's height in content inside of it.
Scroll window to the bottom of target div.
None of these worked for me, I have a message system inside a web app that's similar to Facebook messenger and wanted the messages to appear at the bottom of a div.
You can use below code to scroll to bottom of div on page load.
In my specific situation (scrollable div wrapped in a bootstrap modal), a v-if showed new content, which I wanted the page to scroll down to.
You can check scrollHeight and clientHeight with scrollTop to scroll to bottom of div like code below.
Using the same examples given above, you would essentially be using a parsing method of finding the divs in the page, and then applying the CSS to it and then reprinting/echoing it out to the end user.
Also, you probably don't need to have the DIV, just setting the style to display: none on the checkbox would probably be sufficient.
This would seem to be more idiomatic than trying to force a <div> not to display itself--if in fact the checkbox itself cannot be styled in the way you want.
I think its better to to do text-align center for div and let image take care of the height.
Just specify a top and bottom padding for div to have space between image and div.
Note, that you'll also have to set an initial min-width for your outer div.

[Feeela (hyper-link)] is right but you can get a parent div contracting or expanding to a child element if you reverse your div positioning like this:
To solve this (instead of calculate the iframe's height using the body, document or window) I created a div that wraps the whole page content (a div with an id="page" for example) and then I used  its height.
You just have to duplicate the content of child1 and child2 in relative divs with display:none in parent div.
When your jquery (or whatever) calls the absolute div, just set the according relative div (child1_1 or child2_2) with display:block AND visibility:hidden.
The relative child will still be invisible but will make parent's div higher.
Also since you are trying to reposition divs consider css grid
you can play with the positioning of the hack div to affect where the child positions itself.
By default, div elements are displayed as block elements, so they have 100% width, making centering them meaningless.
As suggested by Arief, you must specify a width and you can then use auto when specifying margin in order to center a div.
Alternatively, you could also force display: inline, but then you'd have something that pretty much behaves like a span instead of a div, so that doesn't make a lot of sense.
An element with ‘display: block’ (as div is by default) has a width determined by the width of its container.
The idea here is that you contain the content you want to center in two divs, an outer one and an inner one.
You float both divs so that their widths automatically shrink to fit your content.
Next, you relatively position the outer div with it's right edge in the center of the container.
Lastly, you relatively position the inner div the opposite direction by half of its own width (actually the outer div's width, but they are the same).
You may need that empty div at the end if you depend on your "product" content to size the height for the "product_container".
It still requires nested divs tho, which isnt very semantic but it just works...
If you add overflow: auto; ( or hidden ) to div.product_container, then you don't need div.clear.
The reason, why it's better without div.clear (apart that it feels wrong to have an empty element) is Firefox'es overzealous margin assignment.
If you dont provide "overflow:hidden" for ".product_container"   the "outer-center" div will overlap other nearby contents to the right of it.
Just wrap it with a Div with the class of outerElement and give the inner element the class of innerElement.
use span istead of the inner divs
This is a good trick to center a div in a container without adding extra HTML nor applying constraining styles to the container (like text-align: center; which would center all other inline content in the container), while keeping dynamic width for the contained div:
This is one way to center anything within a div not know the inner width of the elements.
If all the divs inside that masterdiv needs to be cleared, it this.
else, you need to iterate on all the div children of #masterdiv, and check if the id starts with childdiv.

Update ... five years later, one could use flexbox on the parent DIV element to easily center the button both horizontally and vertically.
Supposing div is #div and button is #button:
Then nest the button into div as usual.
The first one will center align everything inside the div.
Easiest thing is input it as a "div" give it a "margin:0 auto " but if you want it to be centered u need to give it a width
To center a <button type = "button"> both vertically and horizontally within a <div> which width is computed dynamically like in your case, this is what to do:
Set text-align: center; to the wrapping <div>: this will center the button whenever you resize the <div> (or rather the window)
This is the rule on how to calculate valuepx:
valuepx = (wrappingDIVheight - buttonHeight)/2
Responsive way to center your button in a div:
By adding this css code line to the h2 tag or to the div tag that holds the button tag
So in your example, even if you didn't have any other explicitly clickable elements in the div, every child element of the div would bubble their click event up the DOM to until the DIV's click event handler catches it.
You need to stop the event from reaching (bubbling to) the parent (the div).
If you have multiple elements in the clickable div, you should do this:
By a adding an onClick function for the child modal (content div) mouse click events are prevented to reach the 'closeLogin' function of the parent element.
This did the trick for me and I was able to create a modal effect with 2 simple divs.
e.stopPropagation() is a correct solution, but in case you don't want to attach any event handler to your inner anchor, you can simply attach this handler to your outer div:
You can check whether the target is not your div-element and then issue another click event on the parent after which you will "return" from the handle.
In other words, if a <div> has opacity set you render the div and all its kids into a temporary buffer, and then composite that whole buffer into the page with the given opacity setting.
Basically it uses JavaScript to remove all children from the parent div, then reposition the child elements back to where they should be without actually being children of that element anymore.
I was doing an svg demo today, and i needed svg to be inside div (because svg is created with parent's div width and height, to animate the path around), and this parent div needed to be invisible during svg path animation (and then this div was supposed to animate opacity from 0 to 1, it's the most important part).
And because parent div with opacity: 0 was hiding my svg, i came across this hack with visibility option (child with visibility: visible can be seen inside parent with visibility: hidden):
The text container div can be put outside of the parent div but with absolute positioning projecting the desired effect.
the Text is not visible because inheriting opacity from parent div.
the Text is visible with same color as of background because the div is not in the transparent div
There is no one size fits-all approach, but one thing that I found particularly helpful is setting opacity for a div's direct children, except for the one that you want to keep fully visible.
The first div is first in markup, but positioned to the right or below the second.
OK, now you have a gap so you may use that, but good ol' techs are still unavoidable, like <div><div></div></div> wrapping for constructing unique items with unique gaps (use padding for gapping!
Simple way of doing this is by adding margin-left and margin-right to the children div and adjust the margin value accordingly
The 'justify-content' property makes even the gaps, no matter what's your containing div width.
Remaining space is divided by 4 (yep that's our number of elements) giving each .item its width.
I think there are two ways to make a div center align through CSS.
[http://w3webpro.blogspot.in/2013/07/how-to-make-div-horizontally-and.html (hyper-link)]
margin-top and margin-left should be according to your div box size
I know I am late to the party but here is a way to center a div with unknown dimension inside a parent of unknown dimension.
There is actually a solution, using css3, which can vertically center a div of unknown height.
The trick is to move the div down by 50%, then use transformY to get it back up to the middle.
The first div takes up the whole screen and has a display:flex set for every browser.
The second div (centered div) takes advantage of the display:flex div where margin:auto works brilliantly.
then you can make use of transform property to align a div at the center.
The catch here is that you don't even have to specify the height and width of the div as it takes care by itself.
Also, if you want to position a div at the center of another div, then you can just specify the position of outer div as relative and then this CSS starts working for your div.
When you specify left and top at 50%, the div goes at the the bottom right quarter of the page with its top-left end pinned at the center of the page.
This is because, the left/top properties(when given in %) are calculated based on height of the outer div(in your case, window).
But transform uses height/width of the element to determine translation, so you div will move left(50% width) and top(50% its height) since they are given in negatives, thus aligning it to the center of the page.
First position the div's top left corner at the center of the page (using position: fixed; top: 50%; left: 50%).
Then, translate moves it up by 50% of the div's height to center it vertically on the page.
Finally, translate also moves the div to the right by 50% of it's width to center it horizontally.
Notice, however, that this method makes this div stay in one place while the page is being scrolled.
In case you know a defined sized for your div you could use calc.
Notes: This works only if you hard coded the width and height of your ``div` in the CSS.
This is the best code to centre the div bot horizontally and vertically
position: absolute div in body document
Say you want the height of you container to occupy 60% (60vh) of the screen, you can divide the rest (40vh) equally between the top and the bottom margin so that the element aligns itself in the centre automatically.
So minus the div width and height 50% and set left margin and right margin.
You can do it server side: by measuring the image and then setting the div size, OR loading the image with JS, read it's attributes and then set the DIV size.
And here is an idea, put the same image inside the div as an IMG tag, but give it visibility: hidden + play with position relative+ give this div the image as background.
You can hack around it by measuring the background image on the server and then applying those attributes to the div, as others have mentioned.
You could also hack up some javascript to resize the div based on the image size (once the image has been downloaded) - this is basically the same thing.
If you need your div to auto-fit the image, I might ask why don't you just put an <img> tag inside your div?
Then make the background-image of the surrounding div the same as the image.
This will set the surrounding div to the size of the image in the img element but display it as a background.
If you can make an image on Photoshop where the main layer has an opacity of 1 or so and is basically transparent, put that img in the div and then make the real picture the background image.
just add to div
Had this issue with the Umbraco CMS and in this scenario you can add the image to the div using something like this for the 'style' attribute of the div:
Here is a working prototype (you can resize and check the div height): [http://jsfiddle.net/TPEFn/2/ (hyper-link)]
I wanted to have a div in the center of the image, and this will allow me of that.
the trick is just to set the enclosed div just as a normal div with dimensional values same as the background dimensional values (in this example, 100% and 40vw).
Setup your divs
Below you have your div that you want the background to appear on ("hero") and then the inner content/text you want to overlay on top of your background image ("inner").
Next calculate your aspect ratio for your image by dividing the height of your image by the width.
Finally, add a jQuery event listener for window resize and then calculate your hero div's height based off of the aspect ratio and update it.
If you don't, then the hero div won't adjust until you resize the window.
This will cause the div to resize its height to the actual pixel size of the image.
If it is a single predetermined background image and you want the div to to be responsive without distorting the aspect ratio of the background image you can first calculate the aspect ratio of the image and then create a div which preserves it's aspect ratio by doing the following:
Say you want an aspect ratio of 4/1 and the width of the div is 32%:
We simply divide one dimension through another.
When we have image ratio we can simply calculate the height of the div by multiplying the ratio by viewport width:
To me, it works, sets div height properly and changes it when the window is resized.
z-index is just for placing image actually at the background, you can of course place img.background above the div.content.
NOTE: it might cause the div.content has same height of the picture, so if div.content have any children that placed according to its height, you might want set a number not something like 'auto'.
I would do the reverse and place the image inside of the main div with a width of 100%, which will make both the div and image responsive to screen size,
Then add the content within an absolute positioned div with width and height of 100% inside of the main div.
In the comments below there's some discussion about $("<div>") vs $("<div></div>") vs $(document.createElement('div')) as a way of creating new elements, and which is "best".
Is the shortest/easiest way to create a DIV element in jQuery.
I feel using document.createElement('div') together with jQuery is faster:
But this syntax is better than $("<div></div>"), and it's a very good value for that money.
You have to make a wrapper, float it, then position absolute your div and give to it 100% height.
Explanation: The .right div is absolutely positioned.
That means that its width and height, and top and left positiones will be calculed based on the first parent div absolutely or relative positioned ONLY if width or height properties are explicitly declared in CSS; if they aren't explicty declared, those properties will be calculed based on the parent container (.right-wrapper).
So, the 100% height of the DIV will be calculed based on .container final height, and the final position of .right position will be calculed based on the parent container.
Thanks to @Itay in [Floated div, 100% height (hyper-link)]
Above is the CSS for outer div
Above is the inner div
If you are using jQuery you can use $('#mydiv').append('html content') and it will keep the existing content.
Which will destroy all nodes inside your div and recreate new ones.
However, this didn't quite do the trick for me since I needed a new line after each message, so my DIV turned into a styled UL with this code:
The following method is less general than others however it's great when you are sure that your last child node of the div is already a text node.
Get the id of the div whose content you want to change then assign the text as below:
change onClick to onClick="changeDivContent(this)" and try
The size() method just returns the number of elements that the jQuery selector selects - in this case the number of elements with the class mydivclass.
If it returns 0, the expression is false, and therefore there are none, and if it returns any other number, the divs must exist.
check if the div exists with a certain class
[http://jsperf.com/check-if-div-exists/3 (hyper-link)]
To test for div elements explicitly:
if( $('div.mydivclass').length ){...}
To hide the div with particuler id :
At your parent DIV add
To the parent div add a height say 50px.
Make the child (in this case a span) the same line-height as the parent <div>'s height
I made the div and spans inside the same line height.
CSS (option for multiple spans in a div)
A solution for that would be to copy into a content editable div and then copy it using the execCommand in a similar way.
Because most browsers nowadays support div content edit, I propose a solution that does not create hidden element(s), preserve text formatting and use pure JavaScript or jQuery library.
you can copy an individual text apart from an HTML element's text.
You can add 3 extra rows so when the user scroll back to the top, the div will stick on its old place:
I have links setup in a div so it is a vertical list of letter and number links.
This solution caches the selectors for faster performance and also solves the "jumping" issue when the sticky div becomes sticky.
It pulls together the techniques discussed in [this duplicate question (hyper-link)], and generates the required helper DIVs dynamically so no extra HTML is required.
If you want the div to be on sidebar to the right, and float within a range (i.e., you need to specify top and bottom anchor positions).
It also fixes a bug when you view this on mobile devices (you need to check left scroll position otherwise the div will move off screen).
sticky till the footer hits the div:
As [Josh Lee (hyper-link)] and [Colin 't Hart (hyper-link)] have said, you could optionally just use position: sticky; top: 0; applying to the div that you want the scrolling at...
Just replace #sticky_div's_name_here with the name of your div, i.e.
if your div was <div id="example"> you would put #example { position: sticky; top: 0; }.
You can clone the node and append it to any desired parent element, and also manipulate it by manipulating individual properties, rather than having to e.g.
The problem however is that my code was breaking because her solution wrapped the element into a DIV.
And use it like this: $("#myDiv").outerHTML();
EDIT: Took advice and changed div tags to p tags because it's less typing and works the same.
$.html = el => $("<div>"+el+"</div>").html().trim();
var parentDiv = pDoc.parentElement
The second parameter $('#mydiv') which is passed to the jQuery 'input' Selector is the context.
In this case the each() clause will iterate through all input elements within the #mydiv container, even if they are not direct children of #mydiv.
If you absolutely position the elements inside the div, you can set the padding top and bottom to 50%.
to any children of the div you want to capture the click.
Basically it says if the target is the div then run the code otherwise do nothing (don't hide it)
If you need to support IE6, use JavaScript so manage the size of the wrapper div (set the position of the element in pixels after reading the window size).
Use an outer wrapper div set to 100% and then your inner wrapper div 100% should be now relative to that.
Your two divs #left and #right will display a vertical scrollbar if their content is too high.
My guess is that RTL is messed up because you have float: left on the encapsulated divs.
The divs may be separated by spaces.
You can use this for any arbitrary number of child divs without adding a boxN class to each one by changing
This selects any div that is the first child of the #container div, and no others below it.
Markup is simple - a bunch of divs with some container element.
I had rows of three divs I wanted justified so used the:
this allows the center div in each row to have a margin that forces the 1st and 3rd div to the outside edges of the container
Create a container div
Justify content of container div
The easiest is to put overflow:hidden on the parent div and don't specify a height:
Another way is to also float the parent div:
Put your floating div(s) in a div and in CSS give it overflow:hidden;
it will work fine.
You can easily do with first you can make the div flex and apply justify content right or left and your problem is solved.
But if anyone else comes here using bootstrap, it worked for me to explicitly set the X-axis margins of an intermediary row div to zero and also set justify-content-between:
You already have the variable iDiv which still refers to the original element <div id='block'> you've created.
You just need to create another <div> and call appendChild().
You can alternately append the new innerDiv to the outer div before you add both to the <body>.
Works for me  directly when the div and contents are not themselves dynamic of course, or you can even manipulate the string to change that too, though the string manipulating is complex than the "element.property=bla" approach, this gives some very welcome flexibility, and is a great debugging tool too :) Hope it helps.
Put a large div inside the div, center that, and the center the image inside that div.
To center it vertically also, you can use the same for the inner div, but you would need the height of the image to place it absolutely inside it.
It has to work for you if the left and top of your parent div are not the very top and left of the window of your screen.
i'm a huge fan of making an image the background of a div/node -- then you can just use the background-position: center attribute to center it regardless of screen size
If you just leave the height: 100% and use display:block; the div will take as much space as the content inside the div.
I had an overlayed semi transparent div with a loading animation in it that I needed displayed while the page was loading.
Here is what you should do in the CSS style, on the main div
Usually this problem arises when the Child elements of a Parent Div are floated.
Then, in your HTML, add the .clearfix class to your parent Div.
This will expand the div to the available viewport height.
This will include your each dynamic div as per the content.
Suppose if you have a common div with class it will increase height of each dynamic div according to the content
It's not the exact way to write it, but if you make the main div display as a table, it expands and then I implemented scroll bars.
Just add these two line in your css id #some_div
[How to create a custom scrollbar on a div (Facebook style) (hyper-link)]
There is a way by which you can apply custom scrollbars to custom div elements in your HTML documents.
Suppose you have the div as
Just as an example, a div with a width and height of 10px and a border of 1px, will have an outer width and height of 12px.
For your case, to make it appear like the border is on the "inside" of the div, in your selected CSS class, you can reduce the width and height of the element by double your border size, or you can do the same for the elements padding.
it allows you to set borders without changing div width
In case content of your div is rendered dynamically and you want to set its height, you can use a simple trick with outline:
You can copy your div like this
Just an additional note here as I found this when looking for a solution for a fixed div that I want to scroll.
For my scenario I found that its preferable to take into account the padding on the div so I can hit the end exactly.
I found a solution that when you scroll your window and end of a div shown from bottom gives you an alert.
In this example if you scroll down when div (.posts) finish its give you an alert.
The key code is function scroller() which takes input as the height of the div containing the scrolling section, using overflow:scroll.
You'll see it adds 10 to the div height to get the bottom height.
scrollHeight returns the height of the inner scrolling area, not the displayed height of the div, which in this case is 400px.
If you need to use this on a div that has overflow-y as hidden or scroll, something like this may be what you need.
You best see if you have a parent element of the div you are querying.
If so get the parent element and perform an element.querySelectorAll("div").
Assume that a parent element of the div that we are querying has an id of container.
In XPATH you can select an element, by the text node like the following, whch gets the div that has the following text node.
One caveat is that this may not necessarily grab divs per se, this will grab the parent of the textnode that has the text you are looking for.
for the contains() argument, or else you will have the entire HTML, or outermost div element matched.
or match all tag types (div, h1, p, etc.)
Uses the ES6 spread operator to convert the NodeList of all divs to an array.
Provides output if the div contains the query string, not just if it exactly equals the query string (which happens for some of the other answers).
Outputs the entire div contents, not just the query string.
Allows for multiple divs to contain the string, not just a single div.
document.queryInnerTextAll('div.link', 'go');
This would find all divs containing the link class with the word go in the innerText (eg.
document.queryInnerText('div.link', 'go');
This would work exactly as the example above except it would return only the first matching element.
Try using position:relative on the child div instead.
I´m not sure as to what the second problem is (based on your edit), but if you apply width:inherit to all inner divs, it works: [http://jsfiddle.net/4bGqF/9/ (hyper-link)]
I have used a fixed position for parent div and a max-width for the contents.
header is inside a wrapper div which is with max width of 1024.
... or you can wrap you menu div in another:
It is possible to horisontally center the div this way:
Here's another two-div solution.
Here's a flexbox solution when using a full screen wrapper div.
justify-content centers it's child div horizontally and align-items centers it vertically.
First you need to wrap your header,footer and #body into a #holder div:
Then set height: 100% to html and body (actual body, not your #body div) to ensure you can set minimum height as a percentage on child elements.
Now set min-height: 100% on the #holder div so it fills the content of the screen and use position: absolute to sit the footer at the bottom of the #holder div.
Unfortunately, you have to apply padding-bottom to the #body div that is the same height as the footer to ensure that the footer does not sit above any content:
I've solved a similar issue by putting all of my main content within an extra div tag (id="outer").
I've then moved the div tag with id="footer" outside of this last "outer" div tag.
The result is that the footer sits firmly at the bottom of my page and scrolls with the page too (although, it's still appears inside the "outer" div, but happily outside of the main "content" div.
This is because setting height: 100% only picks up parent div's height!
If your html is more nested (because it's only an element of the full page, or it's within a certain column, etc) then you need to make sure every containing element also has height: 100% set on the div.
the following, where I've added the "full height" class to every div to make sure the height gets all the way down to our header/body/footer elements:
First, your code does not contain a contact div, it has a contacts div!
In sidebar you have contact in the div at the bottom of the page you have contacts.
The code below will scroll to the correct div if you click a link in the sidebar.
Add this little function and use it as so: $('div').scrollTo(500);
you want when a new post is added to 'the_div_holder' then it scrolls its inner content (the div's .post) to the last one like a chat.
So, do the following whenever a new .post is added to the main div holder:
First get the position of the div element upto which u want to scroll by jQuery position() method.
Example : var pos = $("div").position(); 
 Then get the y cordinates (height) of that element with ".top" method.
Example : pos.top; 
Then get the x cordinates of the that div element with ".left" method.
Syntax :  window.scrollTo(x,y); 
 Then just pass the x & y cordinates of the DIV element in the scrollTo() function.
Just simply add div id to href of a < a > tag
So add a new div.row.row-eq-height each 12 columns.
If it makes sense in your context, you can simply add an empty 12-column div after each break, which acts as a divider that hugs the bottom of the tallest cell in your row.
I tied these to divs for the small performance benefit in my constrained usage, but you could remove the tag to make it more generalized like the rest of Bootstrap.
Some of the previous answers explain how to make the divs the same height, but the problem is that when the width is too narrow the divs won't stack, therefore you can implement their answers with one extra part.
For each one you can use the CSS name given here in addition to the row class that you use, so the div should look like this if you always want the divs to be next to each other:
<div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4 col-xs-12">:
For those looking for a quick, easy solution - if you have a relatively consistent set of block content setting a min-height on the div that is a bit bigger than the largest block can be easier to implement.
You can wrap the columns inside a div
If anyone using bootstrap 4 and looking for equal height columns just use row-eq-height to parent div
My solution is to use padding on the col's div (instead of a margin on the inner element).
Equal height by bootstrap class with parent div fixed height or min-height
You didn't gave the div a height.
I also deleted the container div.
The solution is to add height:100%; to all the parent elements of your .wrapper-div as well.
These all solution are good , but if you want to add vertical scroll and don't want to change div height then you can use margin-top:40px; like that to take all the things in position and so it can remain in container and scroll nicely
and update the margin-top value as per you requirements.
First, remove the float attribute on the inner divs.
Then, put [text-align: center (hyper-link)] on the main outer div.
And for the inner divs,
 use [display: inline-block (hyper-link)].
With [Flexbox (hyper-link)] you can easily horizontally (and vertically) center floated children inside a div.
However, it requires two helper divs:
The elements in the layout will dictate the width and height of the "outer" div.
In this example the width for the "outer" div would be 112.
[DIV (hyper-link)] is a generic block level container that can contain any other block or inline elements, including other DIV elements, whereas [P (hyper-link)] is to wrap paragraphs (text).
Think of DIV as a grouping element.
You put elements in a DIV element so that you can set their alignments
<p> represents a paragraph and <div> represents a 'division', I suppose the main difference is that divs are semantically 'meaningless', where as a <p> is supposed to represent something relating to the text itself.
You wouldn't want to have nested <p>s for example, since that wouldn't make much semantic sense (except in the sense of quotations) Whereas people use nested <div>s for page layout.
In HTML, the span and div elements are
  used where parts of a document cannot
  be semantically  described by other
  HTML elements.
They have semantic difference - a <div> element is designed to describe a container of data whereas a <p> element is designed to describe a paragraph of content.
If you need a generic container purely for layout purposes then use a <div>.
Note: It is important to understand that both <div> and <p> are [block-level elements (hyper-link)] which means that most browsers will treat them in a similar fashion.
A div tag is for division, and generally used for creating sections of text.
<div> is used for a block or area in a webpage.
<div> is simply a block container for other content.
Anything that can go in a <p> can go in a <div> but the reverse is not true.
<div> tags can have block-level elements as children.
The <div> element, however, has little to no meaning semantically and therefore can be used as a generic block-level element — most commonly, people use it within layouts because it is meaningless semantically and can be used for generally anything you might require a block-level element for.
A "DIV" tag can wrap "P" tag whereas, a "P" tag can not wrap "DIV" tag-so far I know this difference.
A <div> tag will be rendered without any margin at all.
So div tag can contain other elements.
div can contain other div elements
Which means that div can be stacked while p cannot!
editableDiv you editable element, don't forget to set an id for it.
This is in a contenteditable div element
This code is particularly good for fixing the cursor in a rich text box that you might be making with <div contenteditable="true">.
edit2: Save yourself a lot of headaches and make sure your <div contenteditable=true> is display: inline-block.
This fixes some bugs related to Chrome putting <div> instead of <br> when you press enter.
You only need to float one div if you use margin-left on the other equal to the first div's width.
Make both divs like this.
This will align both divs side-by-side.
Suppose we cannot apply CSS on li as `div ul + ul li'.
This solution is without height/width specification for the father div so it will be responsive to window resizing and most useful cause horizontal scrollbars appears just if needed.
Don't forget to set a Width, both for the container and inner DIVS components.
The property "white-space : nowrap" allows the inner DIVS not to drop on a different line.
You can see more in this tip => [How to set div element to center in html- Obinb blog (hyper-link)]
Here is a link please use this to make the div in the center if position is absolute.
Centering div with position: absolute and width: unknown:
$("#displayPanel div").removeAttr("style")
If you need to apply styles depending on the size of a certain div element on your page, you'll have to use JavaScript to observe changes in the size of that div element instead of media queries.
Element queries allow you to compose your layout out of individually responsive design modules, each with a bit of 'self-awareness' of how they are being displayed on the page.
[Maintain the aspect ratio of a div with CSS (hyper-link)]
Just create a wrapper <div> with a percentage value for padding-bottom, like this:
It will result in a <div> with height equal to 75% of the width of its container (a 4:3 aspect ratio).
For mine I did it by setting the div's max width, hence for small widget won't get affected and the large widget is resized due to the max-width style.
To restate the issue, below we see 3 of the same component, each made up of three orange divs labelled a, b and c.
If we want to change the content of <div> tag whenever the function image()is called, we have to do like this:
The legitimate way to do that irrespective of size of the div for any browser size is :
I found that there is height of div still showing, when it have text or not.
Edit:
To use with multiple individual children (the child must itself be a component) you can do.
Two divs placed anywhere else
The div was sizing to the text, not to the td.
You can fix this on Chrome by making the div display:inline-block, but it doesn't work on IE.
div height=100% in table cell will work only when table has height attribute itself.
If your reason for wanting a 100% div inside a table cell was to be able to have a background color extend to the full height but still be able to have spacing between the cells, you could give the <td> itself the background color and use the CSS border-spacing property to create the margin between the cells.
If you truly need a 100% height div, however, then as others here have mentioned you need to either assign a fixed height to the <table> or use Javascript.
To make height:100% work for the inner div, you have to set a height for the parent td.
This made the inner div height stretch, while the other elements of the table didn't allow the td to become too big.
If you want to also make the table cell have a fixed height so that it does not get bigger based on content (to make the inner div scroll or hide overflow), that is when you have no choice but do some js tricks.
I encounter similar issues frequently and always just use table-layout: fixed; on the table element and height: 100%; on the inner div.
<td width="661" valign="top"><div>Content for New Div Tag Goes Here</div></td>
Then set the div to height: 100%
overflow:auto on that container div within the cell does the trick for me.
Without it the div does not use the entire height.
if <table> <tr> <td> <div> all have height: 100%; set, then the div will fill the dynamic cell height in all browsers.
I does not watch here an old CSS-trick for <div> inside <td>.
If the table cell is the size that you want, just add this css class and assign it to your div:
Edit: one thing you might want to note, if you want to apply a padding to the div in the td, you must add box-sizing: border-box; because of height: 100%.
I figured out a workaround which works if your div doesn't contain text and has an uniform background.
gives the div the desired height and width, but with the big downside of having a list item bullet.
Since the div has a homogeneous background-color I got rid of the bullet with those styles:
what if your wrapping div was 100% and you used padding for a pixel amount, then if the padding # needs to be dynamic, you can easily use jQuery to modify your padding amount when your events fire.
The default width of a div element is auto, which means that it uses the available width.
It's a bit sad having to add extra markup to get the hooks you need for this, but in practice a wrapper div here or there isn't going to hurt anyone.
While Guffa's answer works in many situations, in some cases you may not want the left and/or right pieces of padding to be the parent of the center div.
In these cases, you can use a block formatting context on the center and float the padding divs left and right.
I feel that this element hierarchy is more natural when compared to nested nested divs, and better represents what's on the page.
Note that this only works on divs and other elements that share its 'fill 100% of the width by default' property.
Inputs, tables, and possibly others will require you to wrap them in a container div and add a little more css to restore this quality.
add a float property to the #main_content div - it will then expand to contain its floated contents
You need to force a clear:both before the #main_content div is closed.
I would probably move the <br class="clear" />; into the #main_content div and set the CSS to be:
to your main div.
In CSS: #clear_div{clear:both;}
After the div tag of the inner div add this new following div
I'm running into this on a project myself - I had a table inside a div that was spilling out of the bottom of the div.
None of the height fixes I tried worked, but I found a weird fix for it, and that is to put a paragraph at the bottom of the div with just a period in it.
You can then use CSS and manipulate it like a div in lots of ways but if you don't include a width or height it expands and retracts based on its content.
If you are using jQuery UI, they already have a class the works just a charm 
add a <div> at the bottom inside the div that you want expand with height:auto;
then add a class name ui-helper-clearfix or use this style attribute and add just like below:
add jQuery UI class to the clear div, not the div the you want to expand.
in your div.
I made a fiddle based on the OP posted code here: [http://jsfiddle.net/U5x4T/1/ (hyper-link)], as you remove and add divs inside, you'll notice how does the container expands or reduces in size
*Overflow in the main container (required for the floating divs)
This problem arises when the Child elements of a Parent Div are floated.
Then, in your HTML, add the .clearfix class to your parent Div.
Added display:inline to the div and it grew auto ( not the scroll stuff ) when height content got bigger then the set div height of 200px
for the div that needs to be filled.
On parent DIV:
The outer div is making a square and inner div contains the content.
Another way is to use a transparent 1x1.png with width: 100%, height: auto in a div and absolutely positioned content within it:
You cannot have a different sized border than the div itself.
the solution would be to just add another div under neath, centered or absolute positioned, with the desired 1pixel border and only 1pixel in height.
I have case to have some bottom border between pictures in div container and the best one line code was -  border-bottom-style: inset;
You can add another div as a child and give it a border with small width and place it left, centre or right with usual CSS
You can make your div HTML code and set it directly into body(Or any element) with following code:
Here's a really quick trick:
Let's say you wanna add p tag inside div tag.
put overflow:auto in the parent div
[see more in this link (hyper-link)]
So I tried changing the parent div's display property and display: flex worked !!
In a debugger, open this up and hover the div.
You'll notice that the div itself actually is placed where the top-margin of the H1 element stops.
With this, following the above markup example you would modify your div as such:
use before or after to create virtual element in parent div which can differ margin applied child and parent.
I had been working in a bootstrap modal that I repeatedly bring up with account permissions in a div that overflows on the y dimension.
these two codes worked for me like a charm
this first will take to scroll to the top of the page but if you want to scroll to some specific div use the second one with your div id.
The ID Should have the id of the corresponding div that has the overflow css property.
document.querySelector('#YOUR_OVERFLOWED_DIV').scrollTop = 0;
If you hover over a div, it fades as
normal speed to 100% opacity if the
div does not contain the 'selected'
class
If you hover out of a div, it fades
at slow speed to 30% opacity if the
div does not contain the 'selected'
class
Clicking the button adds 'selected'
class to the red div.
The fading
effects no longer work on the red div
Both divs start at 30% opacity
Hovering over a div fades to 100% opacity, hovering out fades back to 30% opacity.
Clicking a div adds/removes the
'selected' class
saveSelection() is attached to the onmouseup and onkeyup events of the div and saves the selection to the variable savedRange.
restoreSelection() is attached to the onfocus event of the div and reselects the selection saved in savedRange.
This works perfectly unless you want the selection to be restored when the user clicks the div aswell (which is a bit unintuitative as normally you expect the cursor to go where you click but code included for completeness)
The cancelEvent() function also runs the restoreSelection() function because as the click event is cancelled the div doesn't receive focus and therefore nothing is selected at all unless this functions is run.
This allows click events to be cancelled only if the div is not in focus (otherwise you would not be able to change the selection at all).
If you wish to the selection to be change when the div is focused by a click, and not restore the selection onclick (and only when focus is given to the element programtically using document.getElementById("area").focus(); or similar then simply remove the onclick and onmousedown events.
The onblur event and the onDivBlur() and cancelEvent() functions can also safely be removed in these circumstances.
In Firefox you might have the text of the div in a child node (o_div.childNodes[0])
I had a related situation, where I specifically needed to set the cursor position to the END of a contenteditable div.
In the end, I came up with this simple jQuery function to set the carat position to the end of a contenteditable div:
The theory is simple: append a span to the end of the editable, select it, and then remove the span - leaving us with a cursor at the end of the div.
Generic: For every div contentEditable="true"
[To replace text inside a div element, use Node.textContent, which is provided in all current browsers.
This works for me: <div innerHTML = "{{ myVal }}"></div> (Angular2, Alpha 33)
All you need to do, is to create a div in your html file and give it some id:
Short answer was provided here already: use <div [innerHTML]="yourHtml"> binding.
Example: <div [innerHTML]="theHtmlString"></div>
Works in a div or button elements in a table as long as the right selector is used.
Use the CSS Class to prevent from Editing the Div Elements
It will prevent from editing the Div Elements.
If your form inside div simply contains form inputting elements, then this simple query will disable every element inside form tag:
But you can override this default by adjusting the align-self on individual items.
The closest thing to what you're looking for is the [:first-child pseudoclass (hyper-link)]; unfortunately this will not work in your case because you have an <h1> before the <div>s.
What I would suggest is that you either add a class to the <div>, like <div class="first"> and then style it that way, or use jQuery if you really can't add a class:
$('#content > div:first')
but don't be afraid to specify the id of the content div:
Using h1+div ensures that only the first div after the H1 gets the style.
This will apply the CSS to the first div that is a direct child of #content (which may or may not be the first child element of #content)
You have two span6 divs within your row so that will take up the whole 12 spans that a row is made up of.
Adding pull-right to the second span6 div isn't going to do anything to it as it's already sitting to the right.
If you mean you want to have the text in the second span6 div aligned to the right then simple add a new class to that div and give it the text-align: right value e.g.
To float a div to the right pull-right is the recommend way, I feel you are doing things right may be you only need to use text-align:right;
The answer is in nesting another <div> with the "pull-right" class.
bootstrap 3 has a class to align the text within a div
It's impossible NOT to get a scroll bar if your content overflows the height of the div.
While other answers here work, I notice you asked for a div with content.
create div with id name
add text to div
To remove - if you don't like it - the div focus border, set outline: none in the CSS.
One way to do this is to put both images in the HTML, inside a SPAN or DIV, you can hide the default either with CSS, or with JS on page load.
Have the CSS outline everything you need on your div MINUS the background rule, then add two classes (e.g: expanded & collapsed) as rules each with the correct background image (or background position if using a sprite).
What you need to do is add an event to that div that which activates fnSelect in it.
I had only a trouble with Chrome, because when I clicked on an external div, It did not work.
And it will selected test in the div.
but the problem with that is that it selects the Node itself including the DIV tag etc.
Sure it is not div-construction, like you mentioned, but still it is worked for me.
... then you can't use .red:first-of-type (equivalent to .red:nth-of-type(1)), because each element is the first (and only) one of its type (p and div respectively), so both will be matched by the selector.
Element objects actually represents the objects as specified in the HTML file by the tags such as <div id="content"></div>.
Divided to 3 types:
If you're building a large-scale website, you should go with divs and CSS, since it will be easier to maintain over time as your website changes.
If you assign names to each of the divs, you can skin them all together using CSS as well.
Rather complicated to perform where div/span would just work copy-paste-wise.
I'd like to add that div-based layouts are easer to mantain, evolve, and refactor.
You just create some container-divs and place the content where you need to.
And that said I think it also more readable (<div id="sidebar"> vs <tr><td>...</td><td>...<td>sidebar</td></tr>).
I have personally found that many people use too many <div> tags, but in moderation, it can be extremely clean and easy to read.
With CSS you can move bits around, take a look at [http://csszengarden.com/ (hyper-link)]
And no, layout does not usally require a lot of nested divs.
Also, with a div-based layout you can very easily do cool things with a print stylesheet such as excluding headers, footers and navigation from printed pages - I think it would be impossible, or at least much more difficult, to do that with a table-based layout.
If you're doubting that separation of content from layout is easier with divs than with tables, take a look at the div-based HTML at [CSS Zen Garden (hyper-link)], see how changing the stylesheets can drastically change the layout, and think about whether you could achieve the same variety of layouts if the HTML was table based...
If you're doing a table-based layout, you're unlikely to be using CSS to control all the spacing and padding in the cells (if you were, you'd almost certainly find it easier to use floating divs etc.
Realistically I think it's very hard to completely change the layout of a div-and-CSS-based design without changing the divs a bit.
However, with a div-and-CSS-based layout it's much easier to tweak things like the spacing between various blocks, and their relative sizes.
A pile of nested divs is no different than a table - it's just a different set of tags.
I think tables vs divs comes down to the needs of your application.
I spent days trying to get this to work cross-browser with CSS and DIVs and it was a complete nightmare.
No arguments in DIVs favour from me.
It's worth noting that it's difficult if not impossible to find a good DIV+CSS method of rendering contents in two or three columns, that is consistent on all browsers, and still looks just the way I intended.
Which only goes to show that even those advocate the strict DIV & CSS religion, can't follow their own rules.
div's and CSS positioning allow a more flexible design, leading to easier modification and templating of your web pages.
That said, if you aren't interested in the flexibility then using a table rather than some divs that are morphed into a table by CSS is definitely a lot easier and quicker to knock up.
Div's aren't replacing tables, they have their own use in separating content into blocks of related content (, ).
DIVs:
If you put each thumbnail in a DIV, floated left, maybe 10 of them fit on a row.
DIVs:
Add them in.
I once learned that a table loads at once, in other words when a connection is slow, the space where the table comes remains blank until the entire table is loaded, a div on the other hand loads top to bottom as fast as the data comes and regardless if it is allready complete or not.
Then try it with a nice semantically correct div layout site.
It's worth figuring out CSS and divs so the central content column loads and renders before the sidebar in a page layout.
But if you are struggling to use floating divs to vertically align a logo with some sponsorship text, just use the table and move on with life.
Then use the simplest coding techniques -- divs, tables, JavaScript, includes, functions, objects, continuations, whatever -- to structure the application so that the changes fit in a simple and comfortable manner.
All browsers render the css faster because each div is a seperate element, so a screen can be loading as the user is reading.
Which in turn means for most html work, with the exception of forms, the designers will use divs instead of tables.
TABLEs went out of fashion comparatively recently, but there are lots of reasons to prefer DIVs and CSS based layouts (accessibility not the last of them).
I have found that even with the best planning divs come up short in several respects.
there is no way with divs to have a bottom bar that always sits at the bottom of the browser, even when the rest of the content does not go to the bottom of the browser.
In the end, we try to use divs first.
I think using a table is easier than using divs and css.
By the way... why is using a div or a span good separation of content from layout and a table not?
Getting a good layout with only divs often requires a lot of nested divs.
Deeply nested <div>s are an anti-pattern just as table layouts.
On the other hand, even such deep-nested divs don't have many of the problems of table layouts.
In fact, they can even contribute to a semantic structure by logically dividing the content in parts.
The argument that using a table to make sure a few elements line up correctly causes this massive increase in code tend to include examples of how a single DIV can meet all their needs.
I try to avoid TABLEs as much as possible, but when we are designing complex forms that mix multiple control types and different caption positions with pretty strict controls on grouping, using DIVs is unreliable or often near impossible.
Now, I will not argue that these forms could not be redesigned to better accommodate a DIV based layout, but for some of them our customer is adamant about not changing the existing layouts from the previous version (written in classic ASP) because it parallels a paper form that their users are familiar with.
Because the presentation of the forms is dynamic (where the display of some sections is based on the state of the case or the permissions of the user), we use sets of stacked DIVs, each containing a TABLE of logically grouped form elements.
That way we can turn off different sections of the form without the problem of not being table to wrap rows in DIVs.
From past experience, I'd have to go for DIV's.
Even in OOP, the main aim is to reduce the coupling between objects, so this concept can be applied to DIVS and tables.
A DIV is specifically designed to arrange items around a page, so the design should use DIV's, tables should be used to store data.
This isn't really about whether 'divs are better than tables for layout'.
Web pages are the domain of web developers, and if they say div & CSS is better than tables that's good enough for me.
I use both "table" and "div"/"span" tags in HTML markup.
Let me give you few arguments why I am choosing divs:
Using DIVs you can have a simple CSS to arange it as you want.
when more then 3 nested tables for doing something I am thinking to redesign it using DIVs
fast solutions (prototypes), because DIVs box model is different on each browser, because many generators are using tables, etc
Using DIV, you can easily switch things.
I can't for the life of me get our designers to stop using nested DIVS and styled by elementID css in templates that are supposed to be used by clients in CMS projects.
Positioned and styled Divs in some external stylesheet are anathema to the whole idea of WYSIWYG editing.
Good luck trying this with divs in a way that doesn't frustrate users.
In a way, it's a false premise, the "divs vs tables" thing.
Quick-and-dirty division of a page into three columns?
Are DIVs and CSS better for the task of simply laying out rectangles on an HTML page to achieve a given design in the shortest possible time?
When I design my layout using CSS, I generally give every major section its own root (body level) div, and use relative/absolute positioning to get it into its proper place.
The same is true when divs or other block-level elements are used to recreate tables and are highly nested.
The purpose of divs is to be used as a fomating and layout element, and as such, are intended used to hold similar information, and lay it out on the screen for visual users.
To this end, tabular data, that is to say data that makes logical sense to be ordered in two or more dimensions, with some sort of headers, is best placed in tables, and use divs to manage the layout of content on the page.
Increased code size for each page - Since navigation and common structure is often done with the tables, the same code is sent over the network for each request, whereas a div/css based layout pulls the css file over once, and then uses less wordy divs.
However, if the anticipated userbase might include a substantial portion of handicapped individuals, or if the site will be maintained by others for a long time, spending the time up front to do things in a concise, accessible way may payoff more in the end.
I've had to do sites in both of those ways, plus a third, the dreaded "hybrid" layout with tables, divs and styles: Divs/CSS wins, handily.
You'd have to nest divs three deep to match the code weight of just one table cell, right off the bat.
I have full control over every aspect of presentation with divs/css.
My time for maintenance or redesign of a divs/css website is a fraction of what it would be in tables.
Use one table for the overall layout and divs inside it.
I have read so many articles on how to achieve this with divs but have never found anything that works every time with no issues.
Divs are great once you have the overall structure but quite frankly, fluid header/footer and three fluid columns is a total pain in divs.
Divs weren't designed for fluidity so why use them?
A div or span is acceptable for separating content because that is precisely the meaning of those elements.
When we encounter a div, we expect "this is an element used to divide my content into separate parts or areas.
A div can be rendered when it is encountered, even before its contents have been parsed.
That means divs will show up before the page has finished loading.
So, DIV are used, and the disabled can simply read text, and don't get some weird informations about lines/cols when they don't have to be there.
The fact that this is a hotly debated question is a testament to the failure of the W3C to anticipate the diversity of layout designs which would be attempted.
Using divs+css for semantically-friendly layout is a great concept, but the details of implementation are so flawed that they actually limit creative freedom.
I attempted to switch one of our company's sites from tables to divs, and it was such a headache that I totally scrapped the hours of work I had poured into it and went back to tables.
Trying to wrestle with my divs in order to gain control of vertical alignment has cursed me with major psychological issues that I will never shake as long as this debate rages on.
I then spotted a section of text on the pages which was in a div rather than a table.
We put a few of the words from that div in the search engine.
CSS/DIV - it's just jobs for the design boys, isn't it.
The hundreds of hours I've spent debugging DIV/CSS issues, searching the Internet to get some part of markup working with an obscure browser - it drives me mad.
So I've finally decided, purely on commercial grounds, although I keep use to minimum, if I anticipate 20 hours work to get a DIV placed correctly, I'll stick in a table.
They do pay the bills after all and my argument to a manager enforcing the use of CSS/DIV - I would merely point out the customers pay his salary as well!
The only reason all these CSS/DIV arguments occur is because of the shortcoming of CSS in the first place and because the browsers aren't compatible with each other and if they were, half the web designers in the world would be out of a job.
We often have more important things to worry about than the correct semantics of using a table over a div.
Case in point - based on this discussion I converted a few existing tds and trs to divs.
If you're scared of floating divs, go take a course in them.
I still don't quite understand how divs / CSS make it easier to change a page design  when you consider the amount of testing to ensure the changes work on all browsers, especially with all the hacks and so on.
It takes a lot more effort and knowledge to do this with DIVs / CSS.
It also seems to me that the lack of a definitive guide to using DIVS / CSS "out of the box",  that applies to all situations, working on browsers, and written using 'normal' language with no geek speak, also smells of a bit of protectionism.
My time = money, both for me and my customers alike so I am sorry if I don't reject all the pro DIV / CSS arguments in favour of cutting costs and providing value for money for my customers.
Maybe its just the way that developers minds work, but it seems to me far easier to change a complex table structure than it is to modify DIVs / CSS.
With semantic divs:
Of course, if the results need to be acted upon through JavaScript, divs are worth the trouble.
Layout tables are usually dissed because "everybody knows divs & CSS" are the way to go.
But, at the end, div are great way as CSS can be cached by the browser; while table aren't cached !
By still using table for layouts, we are missing on the innovation on the div side.
Many have come up with solutions that make creating layout for divs easier.
I would say, all the theories aside, practically layout with CSS and divs are faster.
What about a new tag (or some extension to the div tag) that allows us to control presentation directly in HTML?
In this instance, your div elements have been changed from block level elements to inline elements.
simply add a border: 2px solid #e60000; to your 2nd div tag CSS.
Which div?
It seems unnecessary to add the wrapper divs.
Also, as to your question on line 26, I don't think the <header> tag is required there, and I think you could omit it since it's on its own in the "main-left" div.
Sounds like a div element, but it’s not.
The div has no semantic meaning.
Before replacing all your div’s with section elements, always ask yourself: “Is all of the content related?”
Before replacing all your div’s with article elements, always ask yourself: “Is  it possible to read it independently from the rest of the web site?”
You could use section or just have the enclosing div.
The main mistake: You have "divitis" in the whole document.Why this?
It is a fairly generic element, but
  still has way more semantic meaning than the plain old <div>.
Whereas <section> is for grouping distinct sections of content or
  functionality, <article> is for containing related individual
  standalone pieces of content, such as individual blog posts, videos,
  images or news items.
Where does that leave <div>?
So, with all these great new elements to use on our pages, the days of
  the humble <div> are numbered, surely?
In fact, the <div>
  still has a perfectly valid use.
A common example is
  using a <div> to wrap all of the content on the page, and then using
  CSS to centre all the content in the browser window, or apply a
  specific background image to the whole content.
Is this div right?

Or only a div?
Is this div right?
The <div> is probably wrong.
Split left/right column with a div.
Div with all (non-related) news items
Hmm, div or section?
Or remove this div and only use the article-tag
Remove the <div>.
According to [Nathan's answer (hyper-link)], this makes perfect sense (for red and orange parts, maybe you could use div's and/or header and footer respectively):
In the place of div you can add any element or remove it altogether, and in the place of class you can add any attribute of the specified element.
If you don't need the unique identifier for further styling of the divs and are using HTML5 you could try and go with custom Data Attributes.
div[class|='tocolor'] will match for values of the "class" attribute that begin with "tocolor-", including "tocolor-1", "tocolor-2", etc.
Have a fixed div with width: 100%
Inside the div, make a new static div with margin-left: auto and margin-right: auto, or for table make it align="center".
Tadaaaah, you have centered your fixed div now
Doing this will always keep your fixed div centered on the screen, even with a responsive design.
Normal divs should use margin-left: auto and margin-right: auto, but that doesn't work for fixed divs.
Basically, just give the fixed div a wrapper.
This will center a fixed div within a div while allowing the div to react with the browser.
The div will be centered if there's enough space, but will collide with the edge of the browser if there isn't; similar to how a regular centered div reacts.
If you want to center aligning a fixed position div both vertically and horizontally use this
Using inline-block adds extra space between blocks if you let a real space in your code (like ...</div> </div>...).
Here, we've got extra spaces between <div class="[...] col-lg-2"> and <div class="[...] col-lg-10"> (a carriage return and 2 tabs/8 spaces).
They are important -- without them, the whitespace between the <div> elements will take up space in the layout, breaking the grid system.
Try this in the CSS of the div:
You may need to amend the heights (specifically on .v-center) and remove/change div on div[class*='col-'] for your needs.
I ran into the same situation where I wanted to align a few div elements vertically in a row and found that Bootstrap classes col-xx-xx applies style to the div as float: left.
I had to apply the style on the div elements like style="Float:none" and all my div elements started vertically aligned.
[Vertically align an image inside a div with responsive height (hyper-link)]
2.
Add d-flex align-items-center in the row div.
1) Check the event.target result in your callback to see if it matches your parent div
NOTE that this only checks the immediate parent, if the parent div had nested children then you have to somehow traverse through the elements parents looking for the "Orginal element"
Ah, and MyDiv tag is like this:
This way, when onmouseout goes to a child, grand-child, etc... the style.display='none' is not executed; but when onmouseout goes out of MyDiv it runs.
And then the DIVs tags like this:
So more general, not only for one div and no need to add id="..." on each layer.
So stuff only gets executed when the event is on the parent div.
do_something will fire when the mouse enters thetargetdiv or any of its children, do_something_else will only fire when the mouse leaves thetargetdiv and any of its children.
then for horizontal center div d-flex justify-content-center
and some container
so we have hierarhy of 3 tag: div-column -> div-row -> div-container
If you're using Bootstrap 4, you just have to add 2 divs:
Give the div that's inside the container:
All the content inside this div will show up in the middle of the page.
You need a wrapping div for the bottom one, in order to center it.
If you are using a framework like Ruby on Rails or Spring MVC you may need to use divs with square braces or other chars, that are not allowed you can use document.getElementById and this solution still works if you have multiple inputs with the same type.
Here,
As the div has a class to target the select inside it, code will be:
Most folks used $("div.id_100").val("val2").change(); to get it to work for them.
I had to modify this slightly to $("div#idOfDiv select").val("val2").trigger("change").
And add class "cb" to your parent div:
That doesn't require an extra div or class.
In the codepen [http://codepen.io/omarjuvera/pen/jEXBya (hyper-link)] below, the practice of clearing a float with <div classs="clear"></div> (or other element) is common but frown upon and anti-semantic.
Now we no longer need <div classs="clear"></div> <!-- Acts as a wall --> and keep the semantic police happy.
Other clearfixes either require the floated element to be in a well marked off container or need an extra, semantically empty <div>.
It is so simple clearfix clears the issue by when we using the float properties inside the div element.If we use two div elements one as float:left; and other one as float:right; we can use clearfix for the parent of the two div element.
There isn't one easy way to center div vertically which would do the trick in every situation.
Set parent element's position relative and the div's you want to vertically center to absolute and style it as top:50px; bottom:50px; for example
If you know the height of the div you want to center, you can position it absolutely within its parent and then set the top value to 50%.
That will put the top of the child div 50% of the way down its parent, i.e.
So now you have the vertical midpoint of the child div sitting at the vertical midpoint of the parent - vertically centered!
Change #childdivimage to a span element, and change #parentdivimage to an anchor tag.
Use Javascript to bind a click event to #parentdivimage.
UPDATE 06/10/2014: using div's inside a's is semantically correct in HTML5.
which is semantically correct and works as expected but is not a div any more.
Make the div of id="childdivimag" a span instead, and wrap that in an a element.
As the span and img are in-line elements by default this remains valid, whereas a div is a block level element, and therefore invalid mark-up when contained within an a.
Why don't you strip out the <div> element and replace it with an <a> instead?
Just because the anchor tag isn't a div doesn't mean you can't style it with display:block, a height, width, background, border, etc.
You can make it look like a div but still act like a link.
Parentdivimage should have specified width and height, and its position should be:
Just inside the parentdivimage, next to other divs that parent contains you should put:
The span tag will fill out its parent block which is parentdiv, because of height and width set to 100%.
A link with <div> tags:
If you want a link to cover an entire div, an idea would be to create an empty <a> tag as the first child:
If your div has a fixed-width it shouldn't expand, because you've fixed its width.
If you don't care about a minimum width for the div and really just don't want the div to expand across the whole container, you can float it left -- floated divs by default expand to support their contents, like so:
Forcing the buttons stay in the same line will make them go beyond the fixed width of the div they are in.
If you are okay with that then you can make another div inside the div you already have.
The new div in turn will hold the buttons and have the fixed width of however much space the two buttons need to stay in one line.
You may want to consider [overflow (hyper-link)] property for the chunk of the content outside of the parentDiv border.
<div fxLayout="row" fxLayoutAlign="flex-end">
try float your div's in css
A DIV is by default a BLOCK display element, meaning it sits on its own line.
What is the purpose of using a div here?
I'd suggest a span, as it is an inline-level element, whereas a div is a block-level element.
display:inline; will turn the div into the equivalent of a span.
float:left; keeps the div as a block-level element.
The div is treated as a block element.
Although if you use that, you might as well change the div's to span's.
The div elements are block elements, so by default they take upp the full available width.
This will have the same effect as using span elements instead of div elements.
The div element is intended for document divisions, I usually use a label and a span element for a construct like this:
div's are used to give structure to a website or to contain a lot of text or elements, but you seem to use them as label, you should use span, it will put both text next to eachother automatically and you won't need to wright css code for it.
I have many times succeeded to get div's without line breaks after them, by playing around with the float css attribute and the width css attribute.
use this code for normal div
display: inline;
try this (in CSS) for preventing line breaks in div texts:
divs can't be vertically aligned that way, you can however use margins or position:relative to modify its location.
Otherwise, there's no real way to vertically center a div with just CSS
if you are using fix height div than you can use padding-top according your design need.
if we are using div than vertical align does not work so we use padding top or position according need.
You can vertically align a div in another div.
The .innerDiv's margin must be in this format: margin: auto *px;
Always try to define a height for any vertically aligned div (i.e.
innerDiv) to counter compatibility issues.
Here I have covered up some method of vertically aligning a div.
Unless the aligned div has fixed height, try using the following CSS to the aligned div:
Say you have a header div (height=100) and a footer div (height=50) and the content in the main div that you would like to align has a height of 300:
If you wish to also align it horizontally you'd have to add another div "inner-cell" inside the "cell" div, and give it this style:
You use the :before css attribute to insert a div into the beginning of the parent div, give it display:inline-block and vertical-align:middle and then give those same properties to the child div.
Since vertical-align is for alignment along a line, those inline divs will be considered a line.
Make the :before div height:100%, and the child div will automatically follow and align in the middle of a very tall "line."
The child div can be any height, and you never have to modify its margins/paddings.
If you're not fond of :before, you can always manually put in a div.
Centering the child elements in a div.
simplest way to center your div element is to use this class with following properties.
Create an image with the same colour as the background (white in my case) that will cover the div.
This image has absolute positioning and z-index higher than the div that I want to hide.
Make the inner div (the one that you want to see) position: relative and give it the highest z-order.
main div starts out as hidden.
When the page loads, position the covering image and make the main div visible.
Since the div is a lower z order it will be behind the covering image so not visible.
However, the inner div has a higher z-order again and will be visible.
The benefit of this approach is that the structure and position of the main div and child elements can remain unchanged throughout.
This means that when you want to show the main div, you can simply remove the covering image.
Also, if you want to see what the main div would look like when debugging you can just remove the covering image element in the browser debugger tools, such as firebug in firefox or ctrl+shift+i in chrome.
instead of display:none if your Main Div is text only?
This solution should collapse the text in the parent div without hiding the child div.
Also still works with screen readers without doing weird things like bumping the div out of view or duplicating the object with JS.
note that this will not affect the ID's of the DIVS... another option is this (that will keep the ID's the same:
Put a wrapper around the parent div
Hide the parent div.
Now trigger all events in div 'Inner-Div-Refer' to original div 'Inner-Div'.
Then, use flexbox direction column d-flex flex-column on the container, and flex-grow-1 on any child divs (ie: row) that you want to fill the remaining height.
This works for me for aligning the image to center of div.
It's a simple example of a horizontally and vertically div centered in all screen sizes.
Here is simple CSS rules that put any div in the center
all I did was to add layers of divs that allowed me to center the div, but since I am not using percentages, you need to specify the max-width of the div to be center.
You can use this same method to center more than one column, you just need to add more div layers:
Note: that I added a div with column 12 for md, sm and xs, if you don't do this the first div with background color (in this case "blueviolet") will collapse, you will be able to see the child divs, but not the background color.
Given a full height flexbox div, just us my-auto for even top and bottom margins...
For centering a div assign three class names of bootstrap inside into a div:  ml-0 mr-0 mx-auto
In a given line, items are aligned individually in the cross axis (since there's only one item per line, in the cross axis), vs. collectively in the main axis.
One determines how we'll distribute space around the many flex lines (align-content), whereas the other (align-self) determines how to distribute space around individual flex items in the cross axis, within a given flex line.
The top-level div (.container) is a flex container.
Each child div (.box) is now a flex item.
This approach uses two nested tables with a containing div.
The first table has only one cell which has a div, and the second table is placed inside that div element.
Create two tables one after other, put second table in a div of fixed height and set the overflow property to auto.
You won't be able to get rid of that div element.
I created a component to wrap child components without a DIV.
React v16.0 introduced returning an array of elements in render method without wrapping it in a div: [https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/26/react-v16.0.html (hyper-link)]
The extra wrapping needed (normally with a parent div) because Reacts createElement method require a type parameter which is either a tag name string (such as 'div' or 'span'), a React component type (a class or a function).
The type argument can be either a tag name string (such as 'div' or 'span'), a React component type (a class or a function), or a React fragment type.
I know this question has been answered, you can of course use React.Fragment which doesn't create a node but let's you group stuff like a div.
Additionally if you want to have fun you can implement (and learn lots of things) a React mode that removes the extra div's and for this I really want to share a great video on how you can do it on the react code base itself.
Then loop through all the child elements and check their individual heights.
This will then give the class overflowing, as in  <div class="targetElement overflowing"> to all elements that are overflowing.
I fixed this by adding another div in the one that overflows.
Then you compare the heights of the 2 divs.
In addition, the .html() function should do it while preserving the HTML structure of the div.
(It will empty the parent div hence the child divs will be removed)
Use flex blox in your absoutely positioned div to center its content.
You can do it by using display:table; in parent div and display: table-cell; vertical-align: middle; in child div
The div is not an external resource and it's loaded as part of the body, so the onload event doesn't apply there.
I just want to add here that if any one want to call a function on load event of div & you don't want to use jQuery(due to conflict as in my case) then simply call a function after all the html code or any other code you have written including the function code and 
simply call a function .
And never use trigger twice on div!
You can define function to call before the div tag.
You cannot add event onload on div, but you can add onkeydown and trigger onkeydown event on document load
I am learning javascript and jquery and was going through all the answer,
i faced same issue when calling javascript function for loading div element.
I tried $('<divid>').ready(function(){alert('test'}) and it worked for me.
I want to know is this good way to perform onload call on div element in the way i did using jquery selector.
The same idea holds for any partial modification of the DOM by insertion of an html element, usually a <div>.
Some time ago, I did a hack with the onload event of a nearly invisible <img> contained in a <div>, but discovered that a scoped, empty style will also do:
One comment I feel I need to make about using a <script>is how much harder it is to determine which <div> the script is near, especially in templating where you can't have an identical id in each instance that the template generates.
As all said, you cannot use onLoad event on a DIV instead but it before  body tag.
it's better to check first if the div you want is on that page displayed, so the code doesn't executed in the pages that doesn't contain that DIV to make it load faster and save some time for your application.
so you will need to give that DIV an ID and do:
I had the same question and was trying to get a Div to load a scroll script, using onload or load.
The problem I found was that it would always work before the Div could open, not during or after, so it wouldn't really work.
I placed the Div inside a Span and gave the Span two events, a mouseover and a mouseout.
Then below that Div, I placed a link to open the Div, and gave that link an event for onclick.
Now when the button to open the Div is clicked, the page will jump down part way, and the Div will open above the button, causing the mouseover and mouseout events to help push the scroll down script.
Same way you could use it to do something with (all) divs or only one, if specified, like so:
If you really need to do something with a div, loaded after the DOM is loaded, e.g.
It says "before the DOM is ready" but it works brillant the same way, after an ajax insertion or js-appendChild-whatever of a div.
It will trigger whenever the div having selector #my-id loads completely to DOM.
Avoid using any interval based methods and use [MutationObserver (hyper-link)] targeting a parent div of dynamically loaded div for better efficiency.
Just load an < img > tag inside the div or at last line of div, if you think you want to execute javascript, after loading all data in div.
< div >
< img onLoad="alert('Problem Solved');" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==" />
< / div>
This above image will show only a single Dot(.
Could there another element inside the div that has a width set to something greater than 250?
Remove that and the div will adjust to as high as it needs to be to contain all your text.
It's pretty hard to say definitively without seeing what the rendered html looks like and what styles are being applied to the elements within the treeview div, but the thing that jumps out at me right away is the
If you set 'auto' in overflow-x, scroll will appear only when inner size is biggest that DIV area
However I'd do this with php, generate a JPEG using php standard functions and then display the image, should not be a very hard job, however depends on how flashy the contents of the DIV are
When it is, it converts the widget div to a canvas element and then uses the saveAs() FileSaver interface (via FileSaver.js in browsers that don't support it natively) to save the div as an image named "Dashboard.png".
It's to simple you can use this code for capture the screenshot of particular area 
you have to define the div id in html2canvas.
I'm using here 2 div-:
div id="car"
div id ="chartContainer"
if you want to capture only cars then use car i'm capture here car only you can change chartContainer for capture the graph
html2canvas($('#car')
copy and paste this code
Use this function to get screenshot of div tag
If your div is absolutely positioned and you know the width, you can just use:
Alternatively, you could wrap it a container div
This will hide the div after 1 second (1000 milliseconds).
call the div set the delay time in milliseconds and set the property you want to change, in this case I used .fadeOut() so it could be animated, but you can use .hide() as well.
jquery offers a variety of methods to hide the div in a timed manner that do not require setting up and later clearing or resetting interval timers or other event handlers.
If (in the SO example) you want to stop it overlapping the padding, you'd probably have to create another div, inside the padding, to hold your content.
If your div contains another too-wide block-type piece of content (image, table, etc), you'll need overflow to make it not destroy the layout/design.
Remember that overflow might not break on padding so either nest divs or use a border (whatever works best for you).
You could use a scrollbar (using overflow:auto or overflow:scroll instead of overflow:hidden) but depending on the dimensions of the div, and your design, this might not look or work great.
just switch to a vertical format with containing divs and use min-width in your CSS instead of width -
works for long links inside of a div with a set width and no overflow declared in the css:
For me on a div without fixed size and with dynamic content it worked using:
simply change your div's display to: display: inline;
All I had to do was apply this to the style of the div container with a set width.
Add this to css of your div: word-wrap: break-word;
You have to have a separate div that is just that background, so that you can only apply the opacity to that.
Create the two different divs.
Give the text div a solid background color, because that will be the JavaScript-less default.
Use jQuery to get the text div's height, and apply it to the background div.
The easiest way to do this is with 2 divs, 1 with the background and 1 with the text:
The easiest solution is to create 3 divs.
Make the first div's position relative and  set the one with transparent background to negative z-index, then adjust the position of the content to fit over the transparent background.
Create a div width a class - e.g.
This will add your gallery as the last item in the selected div.
This will add it as the first item in the selected div.
I using "+" (plus) to insert div to html :
document.getElementById('idParent').innerHTML += '<div id="idChild"> content html </div>';
So you cannot see that the div has centered.
Use margin:0 auto; to the child div.
Then you can center the child div inside the parent div.
It would work giving the #container div width:80% (any width less than the main content and have given in %, so that it manages well from both left and right) and giving margin:0px auto; or margin:0 auto; (both work fine).
So finally your div#container is actually centered, but it just occupies the whole width of its parent element.
Technically, your inner DIV (#container) is centered horizontally.
The reason you can't tell is because with the CSS width: auto property the inner DIV is expanding to the same width as its parent.
You must assign a width to the div you want to center.
You can center float div with this little code:
This does solve the problem very well (tested in all new browsers), where the parent div has class="parent" and the child div has id="kid".
Vertical center can only be done using complicated tricks--or by making the parent div function as a table-cell, which is one of the only elements in HTML that properly supports vertical alignment.
To make a div in center.
There isn't any need to assign the width of the div.
Here is a new way to easily center your div using Flexbox display.
domNode is usually an unadorned <div>, which is used as a placeholder for a surface.
However, it seems as if when you hit 'enter' within the contenteditabele div it creates a child div containing the line break <div><br></div> creating an issue with the :empty pseudo-class which only targets elements with no child elements.
Ctrl-a will delete the text, but leaves the child div.
the <div> swifft describes.
1) $element.text().trim().length - it solved problems with <div><br/></div> and &nbsp;
I've created a live demo: "Placeholder for content-editable divs", by HTML & CSS.
And have the placeholder attribute in your contenteditable div.
Setting the line-height to the same height as it's containing div will also work
Since vertical-align works as expected on a td, you could put a single celled table in the div to align its content.
We set the parent div to display as a table and the child div to display as a table-cell.
We can then use vertical-align on the child div and set its value to middle.
Anything inside this child div will be vertically centered.
Here is the latest simplest solution - no need to change anything, just add three lines of CSS rules to your container of the div where you wish to center at.
flex-start, which will align the child div to where the flex flow starts in its parent container.
center, which will align the child div to the center of its parent container.
This is really neat, because you don't need to add an additional div to wrap around all children to put the wrapper in a parent container to center the children.
flex-end, which will align the child div to where the flex flow ends in its parent container.
If the demo, I added another child div, to show they are spread out.
Just put the content inside a table with height 100%, and set the height for the main div
I used this to align everything in the center of the wrapper div in case it helps anyone - I found it simplest:
To vertically center a span or div element within another div, add position relative to parent div and position absolute to the child div.Now the child div can be positioned anywhere inside the div.Example below centers both horizontally and vertically.
DIV does not fire a resize event,  so you won't be able to do exactly what you've coded, but you could look into [monitoring DOM properties (hyper-link)].
If you are actually working with something like resizables, and that is the only way for a div to change in size, then your resize plugin will probably be implementing a callback of its own.
BTW I suggest you to add an id to the div and change the $("div") to $("#yourid"), it's gonna be faster, and it won't break when later you add other divs
For a google maps integration I was looking for a way to detect when a div has changed in size.
this.map in this case is my map div.
Just try this func (it may work not only for divs):
If you just want to resize the div itself you need to specify that in css style.
Also, you can get the div which is visible by:
To hide the horizontal scrollbar, we can just select the scrollbar of the required div and set it to display: none;
So best to inspect element and check the widths of your divs or sections, and remove any right/left margins it may have put in extra.
This is my awesome solution for a div with a dynamic (percentaged) height.
to the inner div.
What it does is moving the inner div's top border to the half height of the outer div (top: 50%;) and then the inner div up by half its height (transform: translateY(-50%)).
With flex, the div seems to be centered vertically too.
div to be centered:
If older support is needed, you could add height:100%; to #down will make the pink div full height, with one caveat.
You can use position:absolute; to absolutely position an element within a parent div.
When using position:absolute; the element will be positioned absolutely from the first positioned parent div, if it can't find one it will position absolutely from the window so you will need to make sure the content div is positioned.
To make the content div positioned, all position values that aren't static will work, but relative is the easiest since it doesn't change the divs positioning by itself.
So add position:relative; to the content div, remove the float from the button and add the following css to the button:
use overflow:auto it will give a scroller to your text within the div :).
It will prevent text from flowing out of the div.
It will break the text as it reaches the end of the div.
You need to apply the following CSS property to the container block (div):
You can use clone, and then since each div has a class of car_well you can use insertAfter to insert after the last div.
If the situation calls for creating new objects from templates, I usually wrap the template div in a hidden storage div and use jquery's html() in conjunction with clone() applying the following technique:
If you feel you must use javascript, or are trying to do this dynamically
Using JQuery, this affects all divs of class "blah":
well it depends if all you want is to position a div and then nothing else, you don't need to use java script for that.
What matters is relative to what container you want to position your div, if you want to position it relative to document body then your div must be positioned absolute and its container must not be positioned relatively or absolutely, in that case your div will be positioned relative to the container.
Elements that are floated are taken out of the normal flow layout, and block elements, such as DIV's, no longer span the width of their parent.
Although this would seem to be hiding any content that goes outside of the div, it actually forces the div to stay within its parent.
Unfortunately, this doesn't to work if you include a right-floated div after the content as well, if anyone knows a good way to get that to work, with good IE compatibility, I'd be very happy to hear it.
If u use above CSS on the right div it will nicely change size with changing size on the left float.
Place this into your DIV style
Use overflow-y:auto for displaying scroll automatically when the content exceeds the divs set height.
property to the class of the required div
I know this is an older question and that the original question needed the div to have a fixed height, but I thought I would share that this can also be accomplished without a fixed pixel height for those looking for that kind of answer.
visible = The overflowing content is not clipped and will make the div larger than the set height.
hidden = The overflowing content is clipped, and the rest of the content that is outside the set height of the div will be invisible
scroll = The overflowing content is clipped, but a scroll-bar is added to see the rest of the content within the set height of the div
auto = If there is overflowing content, it is clipped and a scroll-bar should be added to see the rest of the content within the set height of the div
Try inserting this clearing div before the last </div>
<div style="clear: both; line-height: 0;">&nbsp;</div>
The div style="clear: both" clears the floating an gives the correct height to the container.
You would have to find the position of the element in the DIV you want to scroll to, and set the scrollTop property.
You need to get the top offset of the element you'd like to scroll into view, relative to its parent (the scrolling div container):
The variable topPos is now set to the distance between the top of the scrolling div and the element you wish to have visible (in pixels).
Now we tell the div to scroll to that position using scrollTop:
Again, this will scroll the div so that the element you wish to see is exactly at the top (or if that's not possible, scrolled as far down as it can so it's visible).
You want to scroll the difference between child top position and div's top position.
Here's an example of how to programmatically scroll a <div> horizontally, without JQuery.
In addition, here are functions for scrolling a <div> fully to the left and right.
To scroll an element into view of a div, only if needed, you can use this scrollIfNeeded function:
given you have a div element you need to scroll inside, try this piece of code
document.querySelector('div').scroll(x,y)
this works with me inside a div with a scroll, this should work with you in case you pointed the mouse over this element and then tried to scroll down or up.
I couldn't get the selected answer to work but after a bit of [research (hyper-link)], I found that the horizontal scrolling div must have white-space: nowrap in the css.
You could subscribe for the .click event for the links and change the contents of the div using the [.html (hyper-link)] method:
Note however that if you replace the contents of this div the click handler that you have assigned will be destroyed.
If you intend to inject some new DOM elements inside the div for which you need to attach event handlers, this attachments should be performed inside the .click handler after inserting the new contents.
If you only want to add content to your div, rather than replacing everything in it, you should use append:
Try this to Change content of div using jQuery.
See more @ [Change content of div using jQuery (hyper-link)]
This allows the iframe to inherit the z-index of its container so your opaque <div> would be in front of the iframe.
and that will name your div so you can target it.
Hence, instead of width: 96% on your div, use flex: 1.
So at the moment, it's set to 96% which looks OK until you really squash the screen - then the right hand div gets a bit starved of the space it needs.
The squashing of the fixed-width div is related to another flex property: flex-shrink
Alternative for disabling all events(or chick) on a div is unbind() all event that are attached with tags by default
replace "div" with the ID or element
You need to add overflow:auto to your parent div for it to encompass the inner floated div:
Its because of the float of the div.
Add, <div style="clear: both;"></div> before the .wrapper div ends, like
Suppose if we remove float: right; from our .floated_right class, the div will be rendered from extreme left as it isn't floated.
Under normal circumstances, assuming that no explicit height has been set, a block level element such as a div will set its height based on its content.
The bottom of the parent div will extend beyond the last element.
If one block element is floating (your inner div in your case), other block elements will ignore it because browser removes floating elements from the normal flow of the web page.
Then, because the floated div has been removed from the normal flow, the outside div is filled in, like the inner div isn't there.
If you introduce text in the outside div, the text will place arround de inner div.
In other words, block elements (headers, paragraphs, divs, etc) ignore floating elements and fill in, and inline elements (images, links, text, etc) respect boundaries of floating elements.
you can use overflow property to the container div if you don't have any div to show over the container eg:
This centers the links on one line within the red div.
only css div you can center content
I have used a trick that is setting the image as background of the div container with background-size:cover and background-position:center center
You can use div to achieve this.
divWidth will now be equal to the the width of the first element in your div array.
call below method on div or body tag onclick="show(event);"
function show(event) {
Actually, you don't have to use document.getElementById("mydiv")  .
You can simply use the id of the div, like:

var w = mydiv.clientWidth;
or
var w = mydiv.offsetWidth;
etc.
What you perhaps meant was "the div:hover" instead, which would trigger when the div was chosen.
Just to make sure, if you want to change only one particular div, give it an id ("<div id='something'>") and use the CSS "#something:hover {...}" instead.
If you want to edit a group of divs, make them into a class ("<div class='else'>") and use the CSS ".else {...}" in this case (note the period before the class' name!)
To make the whole div act as a link, set the anchor tag as:
Then set a fixed height to your div tag.
You can just put the anchor around the div.
To change style of div on hover then
Change background color of div on hover.
and thats how youll change your div from red to blue by hovering over it.
you could just contain the div in anchor tag like this:
To center a div, set it's width to some value and add margin: auto.
EDIT, you want to center the div contents, not the div itself.
The problem is that you assigned a fixed width to your .wrap DIV.
The DIV itself is centered (you can see that when you add a border to it) but the DIV is just too wide.
In other words the content does not fill the whole width of the DIV.
To solve the problem you have to make sure, that the .wrap DIV is only as wide as it's content.
As an example, the following code shows the CSS for the container div inside which the contents needs to be centered aligned:
You just do CSS changes for parent div
Set each style property individually:
Remove style attribute from div using J query:
Add style to div using J query:
For Example:
If you want to add style as below:
<div id='voltaic_holder' style='position:absolute;top:-75px !important'>
Use the [.scrollHeight (hyper-link)] property of the DOM node: $('#your_div')[0].scrollHeight
Another simple solution (not very elegant, but not too ugly also) is to place a inner div / span then get his height ($(this).find('span).height()).
It needs a few lines of javascript code to calculate the inner height of the collapsed DIV but after that, it's all CSS.
As david mentions, DIVs do wrap words by default.
You can try specifying a width for the div, whether it be in pixels, percentages or ems, and at that point the div will remain that width and the text will wrap automatically then within the div.
Thus the div elements in <div>some text</div> and <div><span>some text</span></div> will each be considered a parent but <div></div> is not a parent.
Note that this also includes simple text nodes, so it will be true for a <div>text</div>.
and if you want to check div has a perticular children(say <p> use:
You can also check whether div has specific children or not,
#content.myClass is faster than div#content.myClass because the tagName adds a filtering step that you don't need.
You don't need the div in front of the ID as others have suggested.
you can wrap another div around the outside of it, and probably tell it a specific height to occupy.
that way your inner div can show and hide and fadeOut, etc, and the outer div will hold down the real-estate on the page.
Just take the top and left styles out of the fixed position div.
The #content div will be sit wherever the parent div sits, but will be fixed there.
Set everything up as you would if you want to position: absolute inside a position: relative container, and then create a new fixed position div inside the div with position: absolute, but do not set its top and left properties.
The answer is yes, as long as you don't set left: 0 or right: 0 after you set the div position to fixed.
Checkout the sidebar div.
The trick is to NOT use top or left on the element (div) with "position: fixed;".
If these are not specified, the "fixed content" element will appear RELATIVE to the enclosing element (the div with "position:relative;") INSTEAD OF relative to the browser window!!
Above allowed me to locate a closing "X" button at the top of a lot of text in a div with vertical scrolling.
The "X" sits in place (does not move with scrolled text and yet it does move left or right with the enclosing div container when the user resizes the width of the browser window!
Apologies for not providing my javascript hideDiv() function, but it would needlessly make this post longer.
To allowed the div fix position and relative to other div, our solution is to use a father container wrap the fix div and scroll div.
The magic is to take the screen width minus the container width and divide it by 2:
now other divs will not slip underneath.
Use the flex-grow property to the main content div and give the display: flex; to its parent;
This will make the image expand to fill its parent, of which its size is set in the div CSS.
Use max-height:100%; max-width:100%; for the image inside the div.
Below, if we want the div to be the same aspect ratio as the photo, then placeholder.png is a small transparent image with the same aspect ratio as photo.jpg.
Specific to the question, use a 1x1 placeholder to maintain the div's square ratio, with a background image using background-size to maintain the photo's aspect ratio.
I used background-position: center center; so the photo will be centered in the div.
I realized that I had to set the div display to flex, so basically this is my CSS:
inline-flex was required to keep the images from going outside of the div.
Your interior <div> elements should likely both be float:left.
Divs size to 100% the size of their container width automatically.
Try using display:inline-block instead of width:auto on the container div.
The parent div (I assume the outermost div) is display: block and will fill up all available width of its container (in this case, the body) that it can.
An inline div is a freak of the web & should be beaten until it becomes a span (at least 9 times out of 10)...
If you're wanting to put more than inline elements inside those divs then you should be floating those divs rather than making them inline.
Floated divs:
Inline divs:
note that the width of these divs is fluid, so feel free to put widths on them if you want to control the behavior.
You need to contain the three divs.
Note that the divs 'foo' 'bar' and 'baz' are each held within the 'contain' div.
Given that CSS, set your div to class ib, and now it's magically an inline block element.
I would use spans or float the div left.
The only problem with floating is that you have to clear the float afterwards or the containing div must have the overflow style set to auto
Just use a wrapper div with "float: left" and put boxes inside also containing float: left:
You should use <span> instead of <div> for correct way of
  inline.
because div is a block level element, and your requirement is for inline-block level elements.
Objective is to check if the div exist then execute the code.
This will return a number every time it is executed so if there is no div it will give a Zero [0], and as we no 0 can be represented as false in binary so you can use it in if statement.
This is because the inner div has 100% of the opacity of the div it is nested in (which has 40% opacity).
You could create two separate divs like so:
Set your desired CSS opacity and other properties for the background and use the z-index property ([z-index (hyper-link)]) to style and position the bContent div.
With this you can place the div overtope of the background div without having it's opacity mucked with.
This will allow you to nest your divs and still achieve div specific opacity.
The last option is to simply make a semi transparent .png image of the color you want in your desired image editor of choice, set the background-image property to the URL of the image and then you won't have to worry about mucking about with the CSS and losing the capability and organization of a nested div structure.
You can put the "wide-div" outside an element with "row" and it should expand to take up the full width.
You are right, this won't work with centered div.
You can use that value too using the calc function, to calculate a left-margin for the div.
This way you can position it inside the flow, but still sticking out on the left and right side of the centered fixed-width div.
I think that it is the best solution because it does not depend on any external factor, only the div that you want to expand.
That means putting a <div></div> tag inside it should be improper, since the div tag is a block element.
I had a similar issue and wrapped the component in "div" instead of "p" and the error went away.
If you're looking for where this is happening, in console you can use: document.querySelectorAll(" p * div ")
I got this warning by using [Material UI (hyper-link)] components, then I test the component="div" as prop to the below code and everything became correct:
Actually, this warning happens because in the Material UI the default HTML tag of Grid component is div tag and the default Typography HTML tag is p tag, So now the warning happens,
You should use div or article or something like that in the render method of App because that way you can put whatever you like inside it.
You cannot have a div inside a paragraph
<p><div></div></p>
Per the tag omission rules listed in the spec, the <p> tag is automatically closed by the <div> tag, which leaves the </p> tag without a matching <p>.
The browser is well within its rights to attempt to correct it by adding an open <p> tag after the <div>:
You can't put a <div> inside a <p> and get consistent results from various browsers.
You can put <div> inside a <div> though so if you replace your <p> with <div class="p"> and style it appropriately, you can get what you want.
<Card.Text> by default shows up as a  in the HTML tree once rendered and basically having a custom React component returning its jsx elements within a <div> it causes a <p><div>...</div></p> which is a bad HTML.
So to fix this issue if one is using <Card.Text> you can basically use the 'as' attribute as the following
<Card.Text as='div'> and this will resolve the warning because it allow a tree such as <div><div></div></div>

First set position of the parent DIV to relative (specifying the offset, i.e.
is not necessary) and then apply position: absolute to the child DIV with the offset you want.
You want to use position: absolute while inside the other div.
You need to set postion:relative of outer DIV and position:absolute of inner div.
you can use position:relative; inside #one div and position:absolute inside #two div.
target will be the clicked element and currentTarget will be the .header div:
$('div[class^="first-"]').not($('.first-bar'))
Also, you shouldn't put raw content into <div>'s, use an appropriate tag such as <p> or <span>.
To make it central, I would add #bloc1 and #bloc2 in a separate div.
Use a table inside a div.
Best practice now may be to using display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap; on div container and flex-basis: XX%; on div
It will make the mentioned 2 divs in the center on the same line.
It's a bit of a hack but you could add an empty div with a width of 1px and height of e.g.
1000px inside your #content div.
Your problem is not that the div is not at  100% height, but that the container around it is not.This will help in the browser I suspect you are using:
In this snippet example, div1-2-1 has a z-index of 1000 but is nevertheless under the div1-1-1 which has a z-index of 3.
This is because div1-1 has a z-index greater than div1-2.
The images are inside a div and there are no class or id with that image.
So logic will be select the elements inside the div where the images are located.
Although not covering this question (because you want to align the <div>s inside the container) but directly related: if you wanted to align just one div horizontally you could do this:
I've use this two approaches when I need to handle horizontal div alignment.first ([Center Aligning Using the margin Property (hyper-link)]):
monitorWidth1 : the div where the overflow is set to auto
mtc : a container div inside monitorWidth1
AdjustOverflowWidth : a css class applied to the #mtc div when the Scrollbar is active
*Use the alert to test cross browser, and then comment out for final production code.
in the html there would be a div with class "elem-list" which is stylized in the css or scss to have a height and an overflow value that isn't hidden.
return false; from the inner div's onclick function:
In event bubbling, if you click on inside div, the inside div click event fired first and then the outer div click fired.
while in event capturing, first the outer div event fired and than the inner div event fired.
you have two 'div' and three '/div'.
This way, if the current target is not the same as the outer div, it will do nothing.
Try to give your div #middle a position: relative.
Division.
The DIV tag is is designed to allow you to define "divisions" of a page (or to "divide a page into logical containers").
Document division
Bear in mind that the definition of div is completely different in HTML5.
The div element has no special meaning at all.
[http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/grouping-content.html#the-div-element (hyper-link)]
You can also give a tabindex of -1, which will make the div only focus-able by script, not the user.
What you posted literally means "Find any divs that are inside of section divs and are the first child of their parent."
It is unclear to me whether you want both children of the main div or not.
Using the > changes the description to: "Find any divs that are the direct descendents of section divs" which is what you want.
If IE6 support is mission-critical, you will have to add classes to the child divs and use that, instead.
Using the following selector, will select just the direct child of the parent, but its rules will be inherited by that div's children divs:
Now, both that div and its children will be red.
Now only that single div that is a direct child of div.section will be red, but its children divs will still be black.
Use div.section > div.
Better yet, use an <h1> tag for the heading and div.section h1 in your CSS, so as to support older browsers (that don't know about the >) and keep your markup semantic.
add this to your div
There are instances where regardless what you do, and depending on the system (Oracle Designer: Oracle 11g - PL/SQL), divs will always go to the next line, in which case you should use the span tag instead.
Your HTML code:
<div>Stack Overflow is the BEST !!
!</div>
CSS:
In some cases with div-lists this is needed.
You can check if the clicked Element is the div you want to check or not:
It depends on the individual use case but it sounds like in this example there are likely to be other nested elements inside the main div e.g.
more divs, lists etc.
Using [Node.contains (hyper-link)] would be a useful way to check whether the target element is within the div that is being checked.
When I pop up my dialog DIV, I simultaneously display another transparent DIV just behind it, covering the whole screen.
This invisible background DIV closes the dialog DIV onClick.
You could also position the hidden div off the screen with a negative margin rather than using display:none, much like a the text indent image replacement technique.
One workaround is to create a parent div outside the element you want to get the height of, apply a height of '0' and hide any overflow.
Your problem may be solved if you give your div a fixed width, as follows:
If it is necessary for you to have a relative width (in percentage), you could wrap your div in a absolute positioned one:
if by .add you mean .append, then the result is the same if #myDiv is empty.
The second creates an additional jQuery wrapper for the second div, then appends it to the first.
Only use two wrappers if you need to manipulate the added div later on.
if you pass just <div></div> to jQuery(), jQuery will take a shortcut and simply do document.createElement('div').
the quickest way to create 100 divs with jQuery:
Just have a div with the following
Here's a pure CSS solution, similar to DarkBee's answer, but without the need for an extra .wrapper div:
For a div-Element you could just set the opacity via a class to enable or disable the effect.
Set the parent div to position: relative, then the inner div to...
Put the div in another div and set the parent div's style to position:relative; Then on the child div set the following CSS properties: position:absolute; bottom:0;
If you put some content in a paragraph tag within a block and want to float a link to the bottom right corner of the block, put the link within the paragraph block and set it to float: right, then put in a div tag with clear: both set just underneath the end of the paragraph tag.
The last div is to make sure the parent tag surrounds the floated tags.
Pretty old question, but still ...
You can float a div to the bottom of the page like this:
I think you could do the same for floating it to the bottom of a parent div.
If you need relative alignment and DIV's still aren't give you what you want, just use tables and set valign = "bottom" in the cell you want the content aligned to the bottom.
I know it's not a great answer to your question since DIV's are supposed to replace tables, but this is what I had to do recently with an image caption and it has worked flawlessly so far.
Not sure, but a scenario posted earlier seemed to work if you use position: relative instead of absolute on the child div.
I got this to work on the first try by adding position:absolute; bottom:0; to the div ID inside the CSS.
The absolute positioning fixes the div to the lowest part of the browser upon loading the page, but when you scroll down if the page is longer it does not scroll with you.
The div goes straight to the bottom upon load so you won't actually see it until you get to the bottom.
This puts a fixed div at the bottom of the page and fixes to the bottom as you scroll down
use absolute position divs advice is really silly, because the whole float thing kind of loses point with absolute positions..
now, I did not find an universal solution, but in a lot of cases prople use floating divs just to display something in a row, like a series of span elements.
to achieve a similar effect you can do this: do not make the div float, but set it's display property to inline-block.
you just need to set parent's div property vertical-align to either top, bottom, middle or baseline
I tried all the div answers, I was unable to get them to do what I needed.
Stu's answer comes the closest to working so far, but it still doesn't take into account the fact that your outer div's height may change, based on the way the text wraps inside of it.
So, repositioning the inner div (by changing the height of the "pipe") only once won't be enough.
Rotate the parent div 180 degrees using 
[code snippet]
JSfiddle: [http://jsfiddle.net/wcneY/ (hyper-link)]
The child footer div will stick with bottom like glue.
simple......in the html file right....have the "footer" (or the div you want at the bottom) at the bottom.
Just set the 'display' of parent div as 'flex' and set the 'margin-top' property to 'auto'.
This does not distort any property of both the div.
This gets parent if it is a div.
Use .closest(), which gets the first ancestor element that matches the given selector 'div':
As @Shef noted, .closest() will return the current element if it happens to be a DIV also.
Some CSS mechanisms like Flexbox and CSS Grid have a special parent-child relationship, and adding divs in the middle makes it hard to keep the desired layout while extracting logical components.
As per the reactjs.org [docs (hyper-link)] most important needs of <Fragment> </Fragment> instead of div's are  to avoid breaking HTML semantics.
When we use div's instead of <Fragment> </Fragment> we break the HTML semantics.
please [click (hyper-link)] 
and also there are cases where if you use div's instead of Fragments it will be invalid html, for example look at this code:
you can replace the extra div tags with React.Fragment
Most attempts to accomplish this were made by assigning the property and value: 
  div{height:100%} - this alone will not work.
The reason is that without a parent defined 
  height, the div{height:100%;} has nothing to factor 100% percent of, and will default to a 
  value of div{height:auto;} - auto is an "as needed value" which is governed by the actual 
  content, so that the div{height:100%} will a=only extend as far as the content demands.
This is generally how I've gotten DIVs to extend to full height:
if setting height to 100% doesn't work, try min-height=100% for div.
divs will naturally take up 100% width of their container, there is no need to explicitly set this width.
By adding a left/right margin the same as the two side divs, it's own contents is forced to sit between them.
Note that the "middle div" goes after the "right div" in the HTML
The Div that has to take the remaining space has to be a class..
The other divs can be id(s) but they must have width..
I was looking for a solution to the opposite problem where I needed a fixed width div in the centre and a fluid width div on either side, so I came up with the following and thought I'd post it here in case anyone needs it.
The best way of fixing it is using clear:both after the second div.
Aside from the clear: both hack, you can skip the extra element and use overflow: hidden on the wrapping div:
If you use borders or margins, you may need to reduce the width of the div that use them.
NOTE: This doesn't work properly in IE6/7 if you use "DIV" instead of "SPAN".
If you have a floated div inside a non-floated div, everything gets all screwy.
That's why most CSS frameworks like Blueprint and 960.gs all use floated containers and divs.
should work just fine, as long as you float:left; all of your <div>s.
height:500px, to the parent division?

Where your divs are:
So the way to calculate the correct $parentDiv.scrollTop() value is to begin by making sure that $parentDiv is positioned.
The elements $innerListItem and all its ancestors up to $parentDiv need to have no explicit position.
I've adjusted Glenn Moss' answer to account for the fact that overflow div might not be at the top of the page.
Anything supported by jQuery, like: #myid, div.myclass, $(jquery object), [dom object], etc.
Note: #innerItem can be anywhere inside #overflow_div.
parentEl.outerHeight() / 2 gets the outer height divided in half (because we want it centered) of the child element.
$(parent).scrollDivToElement(child);
The parent is the scrollable div and it can be a string or a jQuery object of the DOM element.
Add tabindex attributes to your div elements.
for those interested, in addition to the accepted answer, you can add the following jquery to make the div style change when you tab to it, and also handle Enter and Space to trigger a click (then your click handler will do the rest)
Add the tabindex="0"attribute to each div you want tabbable.
Then use CSS pseudo classes :hover and :focus, for example to signify to the app user that the div is in focus and clickable, for example.
All elements are of the same type; I will use divs.
For anyone that shows up on this page for the opposite intention, as in to make a div tag NOT tabbable: [https://github.com/WICG/inert (hyper-link)] is a good way.
It is the container div who has to be with the overflow:auto attribute.
In this case, the #outerfixed div
define a height (or max-height) for #innerstatic2, otherwise it won't overflow, it'll just keep increasing its height (the default for a div is height: auto).
The only way I figure, is to set innerstatic2 to absolute position (so you can use top and bottom to size it in relation to outerfixed), then inside innerstatic2 create another div where you put your text in.
Setting min-height: 100%; height: 1px; on the outer div causes its actual height to be at least 100%, as required.
It also allows the inner div to correctly inherit the height.
The <div> does not accept input, so it cannot have :focus.
You can tab between div tags.
Just add a tab index to the div.
DIV elements can get focus if set the tabindex attribute.
So now with the :focus-within pseudo class - styling the outer div when the textarea gets clicked becomes trivial.
If you want to use .html(SomeValue), SomeValue should have html tags that can be inside a div it must work too.
try this function $('div.total-title').text('test');
anyway, about the problem you are sharing, I think you might be calling the JavaScript code before the HTML code for the DIV is being sent to the browser.
make sure you are calling the jQuery line in a <script> tag after the <div>, or in a statement like this:
this way the script executes after the HTML of the div is parsed by the browser.
<div id="getSessionStorage"></div>
If you need to make the DIV selectable/unselectable on the fly and are willing to use [Modernizr (hyper-link)], the following works neatly in javascript:
You'll have to actually USE jQuery to build the div, if you want to write maintainable or usable code.
Add HTML inside div using JavaScript

If you want a quick demo how you check for empty divs I'd suggest you to try this link:
If your div is empty without anything even no white-space, you can use CSS:
My solution checks if there are any elements inside the div so it would still mark the div empty if there is only text inside it.
Of course, change the height of the second div to the height you want.
You have asked the iframe to fill the entire height of its container (which is the body) but unfortunately it has a block level sibling in the <div> above which you've asked to be 30px big.
Absolutely position your div, which
will take it out of the container so
the iframe alone will consume it's
containers height.
Alternatively you need to specify a
% height for the div and reduce the
height of the iframe by that much.
If the absolute height is really
that important you'll need to apply
that to a child element of the div
instead.
Our iFrame is loaded within a div, hence I needed something else then window.height.
Where of course "#middle" is the id of the div.
note: the div should be your main section.
set position relative to your parent div and position:absolute to your iframe.
Change the outer div to use display:table and ensure it has a width and height set.
Add an extra div around your iframe (or whatever content you need) and make it a table-row with height set to 100% (setting its height is critical if you want to embed an iframe to fill the height)
Mainly because <div /> is not valid HTML.
If you have a look through the different doctypes you'll notice that div cannot be self closing.
A div element must have both a start tag and an end tag.
Source: [http://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/div.html (hyper-link)]
As you can see, none of these elements are the div element, and therefore your second example is invalid HTML5.
A self closing div tag is valid XML, but it's not valid XHTML.
The XHTML standard doesn't say anything specifically about whether the div tag can be self closing or not, so it falls back on the HTML standard that the XHTML standard is based on.
The HTML 4.01 standard says that the div tag requires a closing tag.
For question 1, the answer is simple: <div/> isn't recognized tag soup, so if your browser is in tag soup mode, it won't handle it correctly.
The null-end start tag is <div/, and the null end tag is >, and letting the latter follow the former immediately yields <div/>, which is fine.
The animation you're trying to do is basically .fadeIn(), so just set the div to display: none; initially and use .fadeIn() to animate it:
If you want to show a div after scrolling a number of pixels:
If you want to show a div after scrolling a number of pixels,
If you want to have a nav or div stick or dock to the top of the page once you scroll to it and unstick/undock when you scroll back up:
Also note that had you not added any position attributes to any of the divs you wouldn't have seen this behavior.
When you float those two divs, the content div collapses to zero height.
after the #right div but inside the content div.
That will force the content div to surround the two internal, floating divs.
at the end of the 'wrapping div' (in this case content).
I have divided the screen into two halfs: 20% and 80%:
Best way to divide a div vertically --
Make font size equal to zero in parent DIV.
Set width % for each of child DIVs.
Make children divs inline-block and they will position side by side:
Divide a division in two columns is very easy, just specify the width of your column better if you put this (like width:50%) and set the float:left for left column and float:right for right column.
The question is how to separate a div into 2 columns using css.
All of the above answers actually embed 2 divs into a single div in order to simulate 2 columns.
So, instead of the above, use a single div that is defined to contain 2 columns using CSS as follows...
assign the above as a class to a div, and it will actually flow its contents into the 2 columns.
Depending on the content of the div, you may need to mess with the word break values so your content doesn't get cut up between the columns.
You can use [flexbox (hyper-link)] to control the layout of your div element:
@arnaud576875 Using inline-block elements will work great (cross-browser) in this case as pagination contains just anchors (inline), no list-items or divs:
create two or more div's you want and give them a definite width like 100px for each then float it left or right
then warp these two div's in another div and give it the width of 200px.
to this div apply margin auto.
This way, you're not grabbing the div itself, you're grabbing its contents.
$.load isn't really the best choice here since that function's intended to just fill in the contents of a div, as you've seen.
You can just use [$.get (hyper-link)] instead and set the callback function to replace your original div, or change logged-in-content.html to exclude the div.
You want to wrap in div before inserting it.
Can you add a container DIV around your "secondHeader" div?
My solution that worked for me was that I embedded a child div inside and updated the child div:
Assign an id to your div.
I would suggest that you start with some sort of placeholder, you may have this already, but its somewhere to append the div.
Now, the idea is to dynamically create a new div, with your random id:
I wouldn't normally recommend document.write(), but since your code is already inline and what you were trying do already was to put the div inline, this is the simplest way to do that.
At the point where you have the random number, you just use this to put it and the div into the page:
I might add here at the end that generating a truly random number just to create a unique div ID is way overkill.
Use:
background-size: 100% 100%;
To make background image to fit the div size.
You can pass the content of the div to the function that handles the conversion, which would return a pdf to the user.
Yes, it's possible to To capture div as PDFs in JS.
They have nice and clean JavaScript API which will allow you to capture the content of a single HTML element such as a div or a span.
Now, when the page is loaded an image screenshot will now be created in the same location as the script tag, which will contain all of the contents of the features div and nothing else.
The are other configuration and customization you can do to the div-screenshot mechanism, please check them out [here (hyper-link)]
Content inside a <div class='html-content'>....</div> can be downloaded as pdf with styles using jspdf & html2canvas.
When DIV was introduced, people were so afraid of tables that the poor DIV became the metaphorical hammer.
Just replace the div with id 'thecontent' with your content (the specified height there is just for illustration, you don't have to specify a height on the actual content.
The way that this works is that the outer div acts as a reference point for the nav bar.
The outer div is stretched out by the content of the 'content' div.
For the horizontal alignment we make the content div offset itself by the same width of the navbar.
I wanted to make a DIV as background, why, because its easy to manipulate div through javascript.
Anyways three things I did in the css for that div.
Here is the solution I finally came up with when using a div as a container for a dynamic background.
Without this the cloud-container DIV is removed from the HTML's layout context.
position: relative ensures that the DIV remains inside the HTML box when it is drawn so that bottom:0 refers to the bottom of the HTML box.
I wanted a page-centered div with height 100% of page height, so my total solution was:
Simple, just wrap it up in a table div...
for both, the menu and content div.
The easiest I think is to put your div content hidden wherever you want and then write a function to pass its content to popover.
I needed a way to pass the target DIV as a variable.
HTML for Popover source (added a data attribute data-pop that will hold value for destination DIV id/or class):
I am assuming the parent div has no width or a wide width, and the child div has a smaller width.
This centers the div.
You can use the "auto" value for the left and right margins to let the browser distribute the available space equally at both sides of the inner div:
Just out of interest, if you want to center two or more divs (so they're side by side in the center), then here's how to do it:
Or you could just add some content to the div and use inline-table
Give your parent div position: relative, then give your child div position: absolute, this will absolute position the div inside of its parent, then you can give the child bottom: 0px;
For me, I call this function when a user makes a selection in a drop-down, and then a div in my menu gets populated (this is where I have dynamic text occurring).
Create a lookup table that computes font-size based on the length of the string inside your <div>.
Where: 1 - parent div Id  and 2 - Id of div with my text
You need to use js get better height for body div
Try removing the float:left and width:100% from .header-right — the right div then behaves as requested.
you need to wrap those divs in a wrapper, lets say parent
no need to use float: left in both children
adjust the width of left div using grid-template-columns in .parent
An idea would be that display:flex; with flex-direction: row; is filling the container div with .flex-1 and .flex-2, but that does not mean that .flex-2 has a default height:100%;, even if it is extended to full height.
And to have a child element (.flex-2-child) with height:100%;, you'll need to set the parent to height:100%; or use display:flex; with flex-direction: row; on the .flex-2 div too.
Put overflow-y: auto; on the scrollable div.
The scrollable div must have an explicit height specified.
overflow:auto; on the containing div makes everything inside of it (even floated items) visible and the outer div fully wraps around them.
Without the clearfix, the parent div wouldn't have a height due to it's floating children.
I figured that a great way to do it is setting display: table on the div.
To simply wrap a div without the need of the parent:
So, depending on your use-case, you might get away with using a span instead of a div.
Try <DIV> instead of <div> and see what happens.
Markdownsharp has this characteristic - although on StackOverflow they strip out all DIVs anyway so don't expect it to work here.
For example, due to bugs I was unable to embed a Markdown list inside a div.
Tip: <span class="note"></span> is shorter than <div class="note" markdown="1"></div>, so if you control the CSS you might prefer to use <span> and add display: block; to your CSS.
Even if there is a problem with the auto-expanding of the width of the table-cell it can be resolved easy by inserting another div withing the table-cell and giving it a fixed width.
Anyway, the over-expanding of the width happens in the case of using extremely long words (which I doubt anyone would use a, let's say, 600px long word) or some div's who's width is greater than the table-cell's width.
The Layering Technique must be a very neat solution that involves absolute positioning of div's withing a main relative positioned wrapper div.
It basically consists of a number of child divs and the main div.
The main div has imperatively position: relative to it's css attribute collection.
The children of this div are all imperatively position:absolute.
By using #container { overflow: hidden; } the page I had started to have layout issues in Firefox and IE (when the zoom would go in and out the content would bounce in and out of the parent div).
The solution to this issue is to add a display: inline-block; to the same div with overflow:hidden;
div hover background color change
Most of the other answers use a loop to reduce the font-size until it fits on the div, this is VERY slow since the page needs to re-render the element each time the font changes size.
For now it has some limitations, the div must have a fixed height and width and it does not support wrapping text into multiple lines.
Edit: I have found some more problems with the plugin, it does not handle other box-model besides the standard one and the div can't have margins or borders.
Rather than writing a specific routine or plug-in that answers the exact question, I just rely on the basic ideas and write variations of the code to handle all kinds of layout issues, not just text, including fitting divs, spans, images,... by width, height, area,... within a container, matching another element....
<div class="fittext" max-font-size="50" text="Your text goes here..."></div>
Simply call flexFont and insert the div id and it will adjust the font size between 8px and 96px.
Setting a width of 100% is the full width of the div it's in, not the original full-sized image.
If you can have a fixed width or fixed height of the div (like 200px wide) then it shouldn't be too hard to give the image a range to fill.
This way my image won't break out of the containing div, and I can still float the image within the content div.
Thus div, p etc.
As an addendum: Before HTML 5 while a div inside a li is valid, a div inside a dl, dd, or dt is not!
If I recall correctly, a div inside a li used to be invalid.
@Flower @Superstringcheese
Div should semantically define a section of a document, but it has already practically lost this role.
I'm starting in the webdesign universe and i used DIVs inside LIs with no problem with the semantics.
I think that DIVs aren't allowed on lists, that means you can't put a DIV inside an UL, but it has no problem inserting it on a LI (because LI are just list items haha)
The problem that i have been encountering is that sometimes the DIV behaves somewhat different from usual, but nothing that our good CSS can't handle haha.
I'm not quite sure what you're attempting to use the div for, but this is an example with some random text.
To show vertical scroll bar in your div you need to add
I got an amazing scroller on my div-popup.
To apply, add this style to your div element:
The height you specify will be the height of the div and once if you have contents to exceed this height, you have to scroll it.
If you only have one line of text and your div has a fixed height, you can do this:
The below style to the inner div will center it.
Just add margin: 0 auto; to the inside div.
The key is the margin: 0 auto; on the inner div.
for detail info, let's say the code below will make a div aligned center:
Use display: flex to stretch your divs:
For the parent div:
For child div:
What suited my purpose was to create a div that was always bounded within the overall browser window by a fixed amount.
<div style="position: absolute; top: 127px; left: 75px;right: 75px; bottom: 50px;">
Insofar as the actual window is not forced into scrolling, the div preserves its boundaries to the window edge during all re-sizing.
Here's an alternate method if you can use an extra div:
Also, make sure you have a closing quote on your <div class = "container"> there.
Instead of floating the .square divs, give them display: inline-block.
Simply place margin:auto; for all subsequent divs inside your main wrapper that is text-align:center;.
SHOULD allign all child divs to the center of the parent div i think?
Most elegant solution I could find when you have a dynamic number of div to center is to use
text-align: center; on the parent div, and display: inline-block; on the children.
Because you don't know the number of divs you have, you should use
text-align:center on the outer div
display:inline-block on then inner div
The HTML element auto center main css property display inline-block of the  chide div and add css property text-align center of parent div
I was trying to  find a solution to stopping div highlighting in Chrome, and turned to this post.
You have nothing to worry about a div within a form.
<div> tags are always abused to create a web layout.
Its symbolic purpose is to divide a section/portion in the page so that separate style can be added or applied to it.
And are used against <div>
The  tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document.
[http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp (hyper-link)]
Also [DIV - MDN (hyper-link)]
The HTML  element (or HTML Document Division Element) is the
  generic container for flow content, which does not inherently
  represent anything.
You can use div inside form, if you are talking about using div instead of table, then google about Tableless web design
For me personally, I try to keep a form of hierarchical structure with my elements with a div being the outer most parent element.
You can use a <div> within a form - there is no problem there ....
BUT if you are going to use the <div> as the label for the input dont ... label is a far better option :
document type does not allow element "INPUT" here; missing one of "P", "H1", "H2", "H3", "H4", "H5", "H6", "PRE", "DIV", "ADDRESS" start-tag
Your question doesn't address what you want to put in the DIV tags, which is probably why you've received some incomplete/wrong answers.
The truth is that you can, as Royi said, put DIV tags inside of your forms.
You don't want to do this for labels, for instance, but if you have a form with a bunch of checkboxes that you want to lay out into three columns, then by all means, use DIV tags (or SPAN, HEADER, etc.)
It is completely acceptable to use a DIV inside a <form> tag.
If you look at the default [CSS 2.1 stylesheet (hyper-link)], div and p are both in the display: block category.
Then looking at the HTML 4.01 specification for the form element, they include not only <p> tags, but <table> tags, so of course <div> would meet the same criteria.
I noticed that whenever I would start the form tag inside a div the subsequent div siblings would not be part of the form when I inspect (chrome inspect) henceforth my form would never submit.
I figured that if I put the form tag outside the DIVs it worked.
The form tag should be placed at the start of the parent DIV.
You could use floats and size your div widths using percentages together with min-width to force divs to automatically fall of once minimum width is reached?
All DIVs are:
Then when the page is loaded, I iterate all DIVs in JavaScript to remove gaps between them.
DIVs are not very different in height.
All these answers do NOT take into account that you asked specifically about a DIV element.
what about changing the position: relative on your #content #text div to position: absolute
then you can use the css properties left and top to position within the #content div
Meanwhile, #content div is placed relative, which means "relative to its normal position".
So the position of the 2 divs is not related.
If you set both to relative, the divs will be one after the other, as shown here:
Or if you are directly altering the div (rather than the div being altered by user input in unpredictable ways, like if it is contentEditable), you can simply fire a custom event whenever you do so.
I am running out the door before I could test if this helps at all, but at the very least, you could play with max-height/width settings on the DIV css to make it not break if my solution doesn't work.
Question though, is there a need to enclose the input tag in it's own DIV?
I'm assuming that you want the contained element (<input>) to be smaller than, or contained entirely within, the <div>?
If you've already defined the input as having 100% width of the parent, and then the other attributes are added it will definitely overflow the parent div.
to hide the portion of the input element that would normally overflow the container div.
your best bet is to change the border on the textbox or to throw in another div between teh textbox and the container with a padding of say 2px with a margin-top: -2px and a margin-left:-2px (i'm guessing at the border width)
Jerska's mention of the transparency attribute for the div's CSS was the solution:
[http://jsfiddle.net/jyef3fqr/ (hyper-link)]
This sets the background color of said div to black, but also 40% transparent.
This will not change the text or content of the divs' transparency.
Direct children of the element with the id 'foo' which are divs.
selects all divs that are immediate descendants of #foo
once you have the set of children you can either use the size function:
I've created a [jsperf (hyper-link)] test to see the speed difference and the children() method beaten the child selector (#foo > div) approach by at least 60% in Chrome (canary build v15) 20-30% in Firefox (v4).
[Update] Due to the incorrect markup seen in the OP (before 'markup validated' update by me), both $("#foo > div").length & $('#foo').children().length resulted the same ([jsfiddle (hyper-link)]).
But for correct answer to get ONLY 'div' children, one SHOULD use child selector for correct & better performance
With the most recent version of jquery, you can use $("#superpics div").children().length.
Try this for immediate child elements of type div
You need to define height of ul or your div and set overflow equals to auto as below:
You need to set a height on the DIV.
However, it is possible to show vertical scrollbar through setting height of div to 100% and overflow to auto.
Made a modification to the solutions, so it will work with multiple divs based on class instead of specific IDs.
This assumes that the div class is set to "code".
The solutions above do not work for the content editable div.
Here is how to copy div contenteditable to the clipboard.
I think You are using //--style="display:none"--// for hiding the div.
Depends in how you are hiding your div, diplay=none is different of visibility=hidden and the opacity=0
div is a block element, which always takes up its own line.
use float:left on the div and the link, or use a span.
Add style="display: inline" to your div.
The div tag is a block element, causing that behavior.
If you really want to use div, add style="display: inline".
(Use case: I had a lot of divs in a row that were breaking to the next line, but I wanted the user to scroll to the right instead in this case)
text-align:center; on the parent div Should do the trick
Set text-align:center; to the parent div, and margin:auto; to the child div.
Is the div a fixed width or a fluid width?
Or you could set the parent div to text-align:center; and the child div to text-align:left;.
And left:50%; only centers it according to the whole page when the div is set to position:absolute;.
If yous set the div to left:50%; it should do it relative to the parent div's width.
First of all you can do it with left:50% to center it relative to parent div but for that you need to learn CSS positioning.
if your your div to be centered is positioned relatively, you can just do
just give the parent div position: relative
This should center the div
Try width: 500px or something on parent div.
If the child element is inline (e.g not a div, table etc) I would wrap it up inside a div or a p and make the wrapper's text align css property equal to center.
Otherwise, if the element is a block (display: block, e.g a div or a p) with a fixed width, I'd set its margin left and right css properties to auto.
Create a new div element for your element to center, then add a class specifically for centering that element like this
This will center your content div whenever your container is bigger or smaller.
Assign text-align: center; to the parent and display: inline-block; to the div.
for example, i have an article div which is inside a main content div..
If you want to center elements inside a div and don't care about division size you could use Flex power.
As you can see Outer div is Flex container and Inner must be Flex item that specified with flex: 1 1 auto; for better understand you could see this simple sample.
To get the id of the parent div:
[http://docs.jquery.com/Traversing/parents#expr (hyper-link)]
Thus: $(selector).parents('div:eq(0)'); will match the first parent div of the elements matched by selector.
You could use [event delegation (hyper-link)] on the parent div.
Hint: don't use DIVs for text blocks (for SEO and a better semantic purposes)
DIV elements are block-level by default, which means they automatically get 100% width.
To add IE6 support (sigh), add _height: [yourvalue] to the div.
Any one having this problem hasn't realized on thing (assuming you have this problem and are using div's) anything between div tags is considered (for understanding purposes) a complete set, meaning that in that div is all the things you want it to stand for (computers do what they're told, not what you want them to do) so (for example) in order to set the text-align to center it needs that whole lines space and (ultimately) if it had a border, it would border all the space it used.
In my example I used a div to center it and span to color.
Did I need the div?
I could have achieved the same thing by using the p to center (or I could get rid of the p and just use div).
should give you the first div's content ("1" in this case)
first occurrence of class in div
Second occurrence of class in div
You would probably would have to set the child div to have position: absolute.
If you are having multiple child Div's inside your parent Div, then you can use vertical-align property something like below :
And that would just sit that bottom div back up into the parent div.
The answer posted by Y. Shoham (using absolute positioning) seems to be the simplest solution in most cases where the container is a fixed height, but if the parent DIV has to contain multiple DIVs and auto adjust it's height based on dynamic content, then there can be a problem.
I needed to have two blocks of dynamic content; one aligned to the top of the container and one to the bottom and although I could get the container to adjust to the size of the top DIV, if the DIV aligned to the bottom was taller, it would not resize the container but would extend outside.
Just set display:flex; justify-content: flex-end; flex-direction: column on the parent div (demonstrated in this [fiddle (hyper-link)] as well):
I check that some <div data-cy="parent"> has no images inside.
To achieve a consistent result cross browser, you would usually add another div inside the div and give that no explicit width, and a margin.
The margin will simulate padding for the outer div.
Solution is to wrap your padded div, with fixed width outer div
This will force the browser to calculate the width according to the "outer"-width of the div, it means the padding will be subtracted from the width.
this will force the browser to calculate the width acording to the "outer"-width of the div, it means the padding will be substracted from the width.
This solution worked for me and its display the vertical scrollbar only in child div.
Just add a bit of padding to the image and it resizes itself to fit within the div.
You can try adding overflow:visible to the parent div, then making the child wider than the parent.
Your left: 0; right:0; works with both of these solutions, just note that your child div will draw on top of any divs below it in code, no matter what the div's display property is set to.
You will either have to add a padding-top value to the next div to compensate ([simple example in jsfiddle (hyper-link)]), or another div underneath that has the same height behavior as the child ([a much more elaborate example in codepen (hyper-link)]), which is probably not ideal, but works in simple html/css.
You can make more div and use a z-index property.
So,make a div with line, and rotate it.
Moreover disappearing depends on the box dimensions – style below works for div { width: 100px; height: 100px}, but fails for div { width: 200px; height: 200px} for which in my tests 0.8px in calculations needs to be replaced with at least 1.1048507095px for diagonals to be shown and even then line rendering quality is quite poor.
I needed to draw arbitrary diagonal lines inside any div.
Well you could either add <a></a> tags and place the div inside it, adding an href if you want the div to act as a link.
And then you can access your div with
a whole div links to another page when clicked without javascript and
  with valid code, is this possible?
As you've already put on another comment, it's invalid to nest a div inside an a tag.
However, there's nothing preventing you from making your a tag behave very similarly to a div, with the exception that you cannot nest other block tags inside it.
In HTML5, placing a <div> inside an <a> is valid.
It is possible to make a link fill the entire div which gives the appearance of making the div clickable.
There is an example on [https://www.redracingparts.com/english/motorbikesmotorcycles/stackoverflow/examples/div/clickable.php (hyper-link)]
I'm not saying you should use it, but in HTML5 it's fine to use <a href="#"><div></div></a>.
Secondly, it seems that the reason that your overlay-div won't cover the entire viewport is because you have to remove all margins on BODY and HTML.
Of course the div in the middle needs some content and probably a transparent grey background but I'm sure you get the gist!
Basicly I think you can't make the div scroll because the content of the div does not exceed the height of the div.
In order for the div to become scroll-able the content should actually exceed the height of the div.
Try giving the div a height of lets say 100px, and insert an amount of text large enough to exceed the 100px height, thus making the div scrollable, and then try if what you want to achieve works.
One solution could be to disable scrolling on the inner div if the scrolls has been initiated on the #wrapper, which is demoed on this fiddle:
If I'm understanding this correctly, you want the main div to stay on the top of the parent div?
Added an id to the main div (for convenience)
You could use absolute positioning to pin the footer to the base of the parent div.
The absolute positioning is relative to the parent div rather than outside of the flow since you have already given it the position relative attribute.
Suppose you have 2 divs.
Div A(Outer) and Div B(Inner).
To achieve your task just place Div B code in Div A code and in Div B css class add this
align item to the bottom Then, use mt-auto on the div that you want to stick to the bottom of the parent.
Use a-middle class in the Div...
In above sample loading div will always be in center.
Your div is exactly at the center of the screen
You can't follow the cursor with a DIV, but you can draw a DIV when moving the cursor!
That div must be off the float, so position: absolute should be set.
The solution i found on [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-detect-when-user-scrolls-to-the-bottom-of-a-div/ (hyper-link)] Worked for me, hope it will work for you too.
I do no expect that multiple div's is a good solution.
I think that it is a better idea to restore the old mixin of bootstrap, because it is covering all breakpoints which can be individually defined by the user.
Unfortunately these new bootstrap 4 classes do not work like the old ones on a div using collapse as they set the visible div to block which starts out visible rather than hidden and if you add an extra div around the collapse functionality no longer works.
divs shouldn't be used for tabular data.
For table with divs only so you get cells and rows just like in a table element use the following approach.
Replace table element with a block div (use a  .table class)
Replace each tr or th element with a block div (use a .row class)
Replace each td element with an inline block div (use a .cell class)
The child <div> should have the following CSS properties
So if you're changing the child div via jQuery then you must re-calculate the margins...
You don't add the css file to the div, you add a class to it then put your import at the top of the HTML page like so:
To add a class to a div that is generated via the HtmlGenericControl way you can use:
I think the answer of Curt is correct, however, what if you want to add a class to a div that already has a class declared in the ASP.NET code.
Asp Net Div declaration:
What you want is to load the data again but not reload the div.
You need to make an Ajax query to get data from the server and fill the DIV.
Always take note of the space just before the second # sign, otherwise the above code will return the whole page nested inside you intended DIV.
When this method executes, it retrieves the content of location.href, but then jQuery parses the returned document to find the element with divId.
This element, along with its contents, is inserted into the element with an ID (divId) of result, and the rest of the retrieved document is discarded.
$("#divId").load(location.href + " #divId>*", "");
I followed [this great post (hyper-link)] as an inspiration, and placed each letter within a div
Some of the above answers work well but the text has to wrap with many child div
and it's a lot of extra codes.
The text inside the div should be clean, so I made it with a help of JS.
In your example, you can't: the 5px margin is added to the bounding box of div#two and div#three effectively making their width and height 100% of parent + 5px, which will overflow.
EDIT: In testing, removing the width:100% from div#two will actually let it work properly as divs are block-level and will always fill their parents' widths by default.
By default, the div will stretch to fit the parent container.
If you want the child divs to fit the parent size, you should put a margin at least of the size of the child borders on the child divs (child.margin >= child.bordersize).
I had a similar problem, but in my case, I have content in my div that height-wise will exceed the boundaries of the parent div.
Make sure the outermost div has the following CSS properties:
Here in this [fiddle (hyper-link)] I removed some of the redundant css and used position:relative on the container div instead of absolute.
Instead of using position:relative, you can keep both of the div with absolute positioning using JavaScript, as that seems closer to what you are looking for.
What you need here is a function that will set the top property of the footer div to the exact value you need it to be.
The 266 is the amount of pixels you set for property margin-top for your container  div.
Pros:
 the offset is based on the height of the container div, so it is always positioned directly below the div.
Cons: You must rewrite the code if you add another div that would affect the positioning of the footer.
You can insert another blank div over your non-absolute div and give it height as has your absolute div:
Now we can use JavaScript code to get the height of absolute div and give it to our blank div:
Use a separate wrapper div with 100% height and wrap your container in it that way the wrapper is following the standard flow of the page, and the container can be positioned absolutely within that wrapper, let me know if you need code example.
OSx Lion hides scrollbars while not in use to make it seem more "slick", but at the same time the issue you addressed comes up: people sometimes cannot see whether a div has a scroll feature or not.
The concept is simple: you let the child div have an auto height, but then you paint the background of the parent such that it looks like the child div's background is continuing to the full height.
I did end up having to make one change to the mark-up: a wrapper <div> around the image.
So setting a height of zero on a display:table-row wrapper div made that row fit to the content image exactly.
Setting a height of 100% on the content div made it nicely fill the space in between the image and the minimum height of the parent container.
DIV elements are not compatible with tabindex [in HTML4 (hyper-link)]).
What I think you probably want to do here is use a bit of JS (I would recommend [jQuery (hyper-link)] for something relatively painless) to bind to the focus event on the input element and set border on the parent div.
<div tabindex="0" class="terms_radio">
Looks like divs will not go outside of their body's width.
Even within another div.
What i am thinking is that the inner div's could be loaded through an iFrame, since that is another page and its content could be very wide.
Particularly when using something like Twitter's [Bootstrap (hyper-link)], white-space: nowrap; doesn't always work in CSS when applying padding or margin to a child div.
The display:block is the default display value for the div, but I like to make it explicit.
It doesn't scale to more divs, etc, but that should get you started.
Here's a slightly better version that handles any number of divs (greater than 1):
I though you wanted three divs in a row, and only the ones on the end sliding and whatnot.
If you want it to start on the first div, your css needs to look like this.
To position the div.
The results container div has position: relative meaning it is still in the document flow and will change the layout of elements around it.
You should also check the markup you're using, you have phantom <li>s with no container <ul>, you could probably replace both the div#suggestions and div#autoSuggestionsList with a single <ul> and get the desired result.
give z-index:-1 to flash and give z-index:100 to div..
The easiest fix would be to add position: relative; to the outer div.
Although hopefully you'll have a class/ID wrapped around the divs you're selecting, in which case your code would look like:
div:not([style*="display: none"])
dynamically create a div and set width, height and background
This will work, but only if the two divs are adjacent and b follows a.
If you have divs in between use ~
If you don't want to use the selector + or ~ which aren't compatible with some browsers, it is just possible if the <div /> to show (e.g.
div#b) is a child of the <div /> to hover (e.g.
div#a).
a or em or strong ... [a bunch of other elements none of which are div]
So, <p><div></div></p> is not valid HTML.
Per the tag omission rules listed in the spec, the <p> tag is automatically closed by the <div> tag, which leaves the </p> tag without a matching <p>.
The browser is well within its rights to attempt to correct it by adding an open <p> tag after the <div>:
You can't put a <div> inside a <p> and get consistent results from various browsers.
You can put <div> inside a <div> though so if you replace your <p> with <div class="p"> and style it appropriately, you can get what you want.
Allowing DIV inside P would cause great confusion; I don’t think it has even ever been considered during HTML5 development.
If you try to use DIV inside P, the DIV start tag will implicitly close the P element.
To avoid the problem, do not use P if the content contains, or may contain, a DIV element.
Use DIV instead.
"block" for divs and "inline" for spans.
You can style a span-tag to behave exactly like a div-tag, but it will still be accepted inside the p environment.
It is impossible to place a <div> element inside a <p> in the DOM because the opening <div> tag will automatically close the <p> element.
Your column divs won't effect their containing div while they have absolute positions as they're removed from the normal page flow.
Instead, try floating them then have a div with clear: both; after them.
Set your child divs to float:left/right.
I have just been struggling with that for a while and found a real solution CSS-only is to change positioning of 'absolute' divs to 'relative'.
Easiest way is to just move the modal div so it is outside any elements with special positioning.
This behaviour sometimes occurs when there is an unclosed tag, most especially an unclosed </div>.
You can review where your modal is located and ensure all tags are properly closed or better yet move the div modal closer to the bottom of the page, imediately before </body> tag enclosure
I had this issue and the easiest way to fix it was addind z-index greater than 1040 on the modal-dialog div:
I believe bootstrap create a div modal-backdrop fade in which in my case has the z-index 1040, so if You put the modal-dialog on top of this, it should not be grey out anymore.
I was fixed this by adding style below to DIV tag
I fixed it by removing the backdrop from the body at modal opening, and appended it to the div above the modal:
I resolved my issue by adding data-backdrop="false" to the div:
I found out that it was a z-index problem but, as #mymodal was generated inside the content div and .modal-backdrop at the end of <body>, z-index couldn't work.
I went through my HTML and discovered I had an unclosed <div> tag.
Closing the <div> resolved the issue for me.
PS: The <div> tag was neither an ancestor nor a child of the modal.
#imageDiv is first div that to be hover and
#detailDiv is second div on that css will apply on hover
so if i hover on first div then zindex will assign to second div
User float:left property in child div class
check for div structure in detail : [http://www.dzone.com/links/r/div_table.html (hyper-link)]
Since div's by default are [block (hyper-link)] elements - meaning they will occupy full available width, try using -
The div is now rendered inline i.e.
Position the outer div however you want, then position the inner divs using absolute.
I positioned the divs slightly offset, so that you can see it at work.
All the answers seem pretty old :) I'd prefer CSS grid for a better page layout (absolute divs can be overridden by other divs in the page.)
If you hide the purple div with CSS, you'll see the blue div is at the top.
I do not believe that you can make a background image overflow its div.
Images placed in Image tags can overflow their parent div, but background images are limited by the div for which they are the background.
You can add another div into your footer div and apply the background image to that, though, and have that overflow instead.
Basically, you have a div inside the footer div with it's normal content, with position: absolute, and then the image with position: relative, a negative z-index so it stays "below" everything, and a negative top value of the footer's height minus the image height (in my example, 50px - 600px = -550px).
Set padding of that div to a positive number and margin to negativ
But as a solid workaround, I would suggest to classify that first div as position:relative and use div::before to create an underlying element containing your image.
Classified as position:absolute you can move it anywhere relative to your initial div.
Note: if you want it to be 'on top' of the parent div, use div::after instead.
flex : To use a flex-div as container
clear the div:
There's also [the bad idea of] using several (20+) horizontal or vertical 1px divs to construct a circle.
basically this uses div's position absolute to place a character at the given coordinates.
if you were to change div's position to relative, it'll result in a sine wave...
Just wanted to mention another solution which answers the question of "Easier way to create circle div than using an image?"
Apply it to a div layer:
to any div makes it circular.
For circle, create a div element and then enter width = 2 times of the border radius = 2 times padding.
So if you have a div you can do the same thing.
If you float everything left including the containing divs, it will work.
if you are trying to maximize the height of your content div, in the CSS add
To expand on Mitchel Sellers answer, give your content div height: 100% and give it a auto margin.
Since you know the size (height) of your header, put it inside the content div (or use margins).
But why are you clearing, divToUpdate.html(data); will completely replace the old HTML.
To remove all child elements from your div:
The trick to make infinity's answer work without the flickering is to put the scroll-check on another div then the one you want to have fixed.
Just place an empty div with a class acting like an anchor just above the element you want to have fixed.
You could always use prepend('#div');
Edit: Updated to handle cases of zero children, and specified n > current number of divs.
If you are using [Bootstrap Responsive Utilities (hyper-link)] or similar alternative that allows to hide / show divs depending on the break points, it may be possible to use several elements and show the most appropriate.
Now you can use <div style="color: red; @media (max-width: 200px) { color: green }"> or so.
If you think a 64-bit DIV instruction is a good way to divide by two, then no wonder the compiler's asm output beat your hand-written code, even with -O0 (compile fast, no extra optimization, and store/reload to memory after/before every C statement so a debugger can modify variables).
On Intel Haswell, div r64 is 36 uops, with a latency of 32-96 cycles, and a throughput of one per 21-74 cycles.
[High-uop-count instructions like DIV are microcoded, which can also cause front-end bottlenecks.
shr rax, 1 does the same unsigned division: It's 1 uop, with 1c latency, and can run 2 per clock cycle.
For comparison, 32-bit division is faster, but still horrible vs. shifts.
idiv r32 is 9 uops, 22-29c latency, and one per 8-11c throughput on Haswell.
clang -O0 does compile naively like you thought, even using 64-bit IDIV twice.
(When optimizing, compilers do use both outputs of IDIV when the source does a division and modulus with the same operands, if they use IDIV at all)
This includes recognizing division-by-constant and using shifts (power of 2) or [a fixed-point multiplicative inverse (hyper-link)] (non power of 2) to avoid IDIV (see div_by_13 in the above godbolt link).
gcc -Os (optimize for size) does use IDIV for non-power-of-2 division,
unfortunately even in cases where the multiplicative inverse code is only slightly larger but much faster.
(IDIV and arithmetic-shift "round" differently for negative inputs, see the [SAR insn set ref manual entry (hyper-link)]).
The compiler almost certainly does both computations (which costs neglegibly more since the div/mod is quite long latency, so the multiply-add is "free") and follows up with a CMOV.
But even if a processor doesn't have a shift operation, the integer division is faster than floating point division.
Edit:  your milage may vary on the "integer division is faster than floating point division" statement above.
The comments below reveal that the modern processors have prioritized optimizing fp division over integer division.
For more performance: A simple change is observing that after n = 3n+1, n will be even, so you can divide by 2 immediately.
Here's a big win: If you look at the lowest 8 bits of n, all the steps until you divided by 2 eight times are completely determined by those eight bits.
Run the loop until n ≤ 128, because at that point n could become 1 with fewer than eight divisions by 2, and doing eight or more steps at a time would make you miss the point where you reach 1 for the first time.
If you need the number of operations: In each iteration we do exactly eight divisions by two, and a variable number of (3n + 1) operations, so an obvious method to count the operations would be another array.
MOV 2 and DIV is very expensive; just shift right
<div ng-bind-html-unsafe="expression"></div>
getDivHtml() { //can return html as per requirement} 
Please add appropriate implementation for getDivHtml in associated component.ts file.
It's simple: give the parent div this:
and give the child div(s) this:
You can use Line height a big as height of the div.
Another method for centering a div:
And then apply it to your containing DIV
Use CSS position: absolute; followed by top: 0px; left 0px; in the style attribute of each DIV.
To properly display one div on top of another, we need to use the property position as follows:
External div: position: relative
Internal div: position: absolute
Have the style for the parent div and the child divs' set as following.
The idea is both the grid items are placed at the same row = 1, and col = 1 indices and div("curtain") at the last covers previous div(s) if any.
Another Example - Sliding one div over another div:
The code you've posted does put a div inside another one ([Demo of your code (hyper-link)]).
This would be because of divs being block elements, whereas spans are inline.
will work when you give the DIV margin (left and right) value of auto.
Note: the text is also centered inside the inner DIV, if you want it to remain on the left side just specify text-align: left; for the inner DIV.
I think that the the align="center" aligns the content, so if you wanted to use that method, you would need to use it in a 'wraper' div - a div that just wraps the rest.
left:50% is ignored unless you set the div's position to be something like relative or absolute.
the margins being auto means they grow/shrink to match the browser window (or parent div)
it depends if your div is in position: absolute / fixed or relative / static
To rotate a DIV we can add some CSS that, well, rotates the DIV using CSS transform rotate.
You should use tabIndex attribute to be able to listen onKeyDown event on a div in React.
Using the div trick with tab_index="0" or tabIndex="-1" works, but any time the user is focusing a view that's not an element, you get an ugly focus-outline on the entire website.
This can be fixed by setting the CSS for the div to use outline: none in the focus.
If you want the two divs to be displayed one above the other, the simplest answer is to remove the float: left;from the css declaration, as this causes them to collapse to the size of their contents (or the css defined size), and, well float up against each other.
Alternatively, you could simply add clear:both; to the divs, which will force the floated content to clear previous floats.
The default behaviour of divs is to take the full width available in their parent container.
This is the same as if you'd give the inner divs a width of 100%.
By floating the divs, they ignore their default and size their width to fit the content.
Everything behind it (in the HTML), is placed under the div (on the rendered page).
Get rid of the float, and the divs will be aligned under each other.
If this does not happen, you'll have some other css on divs or children of wrapper defining a floating behaviour or an inline display.
If you want to keep the float, for whatever reason, you can use clear on the 2nd div to reset the floating properties of elements before that element.
Set the main div CSS to somthing like:
You could [stretch the div using absolute positioning (hyper-link)].
what u can also do i place an extra "dummy" div before your last div.
Make it 1 px heigh and the width as much needed to cover the container div/body
This will make the last div appear under it, starting from the left.
I think what you want requires an extra wrapper div.
You might need a wrapper(div) around all of them though that's the same width of the left and right element.
Other than that, it's safe: [Is there a disadvantage of using `display:table-cell`on divs?
Set the parent div as position:relative and the inner element to position:absolute; bottom:0
<div> with some proportions
This is my solution to create a fullscreen div, using pure css.
It displays a full screen div that is persistent on scrolling.
Here is a [JSFiddle demo (hyper-link)] which shows the div element filling both the height and width of the result frame.
If you resize the result frame, the div element resizes accordingly.
What I found the best elegant way is like the following, the most trick here is make the div's position: fixed.
Change the body element into a flex container and the div into a flex item:
Add  display:table; to parent div and  display:table-row; to child divs
And height:0 to first child div.
For the moment the apparent answer would be to restrict your selector from simply 'div' to a system of toggled class names, thereby you could control on what element your focus event would fire.
You cannot use 1 action boolean value to determine which div is clicked and how many times it has been clicked.
To simply prevent firing focus when clicking on div just use mousedown + event.preventDefault().
Set position: relative; on the centered div so that it becomes a layer that you can position elements inside.
The first approach (same as what maioman suggested): [http://jsfiddle.net/u6eydqw8/ (hyper-link)]
the subsequent div addedd after the main_pics do not need to put any *-top anymore..
Set the div's width to (for example) 50%, use JavaScript to check its width, and then set the height accordingly.
This can actually be done with only CSS, but the content inside the div must be absolutely positioned.
You can use multiple [box-shadows (hyper-link)] with several colours on a rounded div.
note: this will work only on body but not on div container with scroll.
To check is whether or not this works with :before instead of div id="aaaa" to make it more css pure and additional divs intependent.
2.Set fixed div left=scrollbarWidth
You can apply click on body of document and cancel click processing if the click event is generated by div with id menu_content, This will bind event to single element and saving binding of click with every element except menu_content
For instance in the following code snippet I am getting events fired by any element except all <li> elements which are descendants of div element with id myNavbar.
I know what pixel values each div and their respective margins hold...so I do the following.
I'll create a wrapper div that has an absolute position and a left value of 50%...so this div now starts in the middle of the screen, and then I subtract half of all the content of the div's width...and I get BEAUTIFULLY scaling content...and I think this works across all browsers, too.
Try it for yourself (this example assumes all content on your site is wrapped in a div tag that uses this wrapper class and all content in it is 200px in width):
EDIT: I forgot to add...you may also want to set width: 0px; on this wrapper div for some browsers to not show the scrollbars, and then you may use absolute positioning for all inner divs.
Set the display of the parent div to display: flex; and the you can align the child elements inside the div using the justify-content: center; (to align the items on main axis) and align-items: center; (to align the items on cross axis).
For this JavaScript to work, put it after your #element div, because plain JavaScript is executed before DOM is ready if it's not instructed to do so.
Don't forget position: relative; on the parent div
As you can see, it doesn't get popped out of the <div>,  it's till inside.
this is achieved by two things: the negative margin on the <button>, and the overflow: hidden; on the <div>
To create a simple div inside another div,making a server round trip ?
Your red div has to have a height specified, min-height doesn't work in IE.
Your issue was that the image should be a background image set to the container div.
Your "Divtitle" class had a padding set so it forced it to go out of bounds.
I also added an extra container div with a set height and width so that way "contentContainer" can be set to 100% width and height with the image but nor screwing anything up.
You can use 2 divs:
The above creates a temporary div that is never placed in the document flow.
This wraps the target in a div.
The height of the div is already calculated and rounded.
Then add div into the tr
put your content inside a floated div
put that floated div within another floated div
put left: 50%, position relative on outer div
put left: -50%, position relative on inner div
finally, nest everything in one more div with overflow:hidden
Instead of absolute positioning the register div I positioned its container.
As a bonus, with this approach you can directly specify the widths for both the centered div and the sidebar in just one place.
remember to add an empty div-container with float:clear afterwards.
There are a couple of things going on here - first, your width on the "registercontainer" div is 1050 - which will force it to clear, causing the "register" div to appear below the 'centered' div.
And use padding for the centered element to push the side div further.
You can make divisions in HTML appear side by side to each other by adding a float property to the css.
Then, add another divsion inside the #frame to do the styling for that portion.
But I think you're going for the wrong structure to accomplish this, is there any actual reason you want a wrapper div?
While there is usually no problem with the width to make it appears to fill the whole length of a screen, it's very difficult in HTML & CSS to do the same with the height as they have not been designed for this sort of thing; especially with an imbricated structure (div inside div).
Integer division is one of the slowest arithmetic operations you can perform on a modern processor, with latency up to the dozens of cycles and bad throughput.
If you know the divisor ahead of time, you can avoid the division by replacing it with a set of other operations (multiplications, additions, and shifts) which have the equivalent effect.
Even if several operations are needed, it's often still a heck of a lot faster than the integer division itself.
Implementing the C / operator this way instead of with a multi-instruction sequence involving div is just GCC's default way of doing division by constants.
(Using -Os for small code size does get GCC to use div, though.)
Using a multiplicative inverse instead of division is like using lea instead of mul and add
As a result, you only tend to see div or idiv in the output if the divisor isn't known at compile-time.
For information on how the compiler generates these sequences, as well as code to let you generate them for yourself (almost certainly unnecessary unless you're working with a braindead compiler), see [libdivide (hyper-link)].
Dividing by 5 is the same as multiplying 1/5, which is again the same as multiplying by 4/5 and shifting right 2 bits.
As to why, multiplication is faster than division, and when the divisor is fixed, this is a faster route.
It shows how the algorithm for finding the reciprocal works, and how to handle signed division and modulo.
Divide the binary representation by 4 (shift right 2 places), and we'll get 0.001100110011... which by trivial inspection can be added the original to get 0.111111111111..., which is obviously equal to 1, the same way 0.9999999... in decimal is equal to one.
In general multiplication is much faster than division.
So if we can get away with multiplying by the reciprocal instead we can significantly speed up division by a constant
A wrinkle is that we cannot represent the reciprocal exactly (unless the division was by a power of two but in that case we can usually just convert the division to a bit shift).
We truncate the value to a 64-bit integer (effectively rounding it towards zero) and then perform a further shift which divides by four and again truncates By looking at the bit level it is clear that we can treat both truncations as a single truncation.
This clearly gives us at least an approximation of division by 5 but does it give us an exact answer correctly rounded towards zero?
The exact answer to a division by 5 will always have a fractional part of 0, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5 or 4/5 .
After the division by 4 the error is less than (1/5) * 2−2.
(1/5) * 2−2 < 1/5 so the answer will always be equal to doing an exact division and rounding towards zero.
Unfortunately this doesn't work for all divisors.
After multiplying by an i value of just under 264 we end up with an error just under 6/7 and after dividing by four we end up with an error of just under 1.5/7 which is greater than 1/7.
So to implement divison by 7 correctly we need to multiply by a 0.65 fixed point number.
Here is link to a document of an algorithm that produces the values and code I see with Visual Studio (in most cases) and that I assume is still used in GCC for division of a variable integer by a constant integer.
[http://gmplib.org/~tege/divcnst-pldi94.pdf (hyper-link)]
In the article, a uword has N bits, a udword has 2N bits, n = numerator = dividend, d = denominator = divisor, ℓ is initially set to ceil(log2(d)), shpre is pre-shift (used before multiply) = e = number of trailing zero bits in d, shpost is post-shift (used after multiply), prec is precision = N - e = N - shpre.
Figure 4.2 and figure 6.2 show how the multiplier can be reduced to a N bit or less multiplier for most divisors.
The numerator (dividend) for mlow and mhigh can be larger than a udword only when denominator (divisor) > 2^(N-1) (when ℓ == N => mlow = 2^(2N)), in this case the optimized replacement for n/d is a compare (if n>=d, q = 1, else q = 0), so no multiplier is generated.
The initial values of mlow and mhigh will be N+1 bits, and two udword/uword divides can be used to produce each N+1 bit value (mlow or mhigh).
For X86, the end result is a two instruction sequence for most divisors, and a five instruction sequence for divisors like 7 (in order to emulate a N+1 bit multiplier as shown in equation 4.5 and figure 4.2 of the pdf file).
When the outer .col-md-6 div is clicked on you can find the currently visible div using the :visible selector.
Alternatively, if you don't want to allow someone to hide the final div:
Or finally, if you want to cycle through all the divs going back to the start once you reach the end:
make position absolute for that div.
By using absolute positioning, you can make <body> or <form> or <div>, fit to your browser page.
and then simply put a <div> inside it and use whatever percentage of either height or width you wish
I've assumed (although you didn't say) that you want the child div to disappear again when you're no longer hovering over the parent.
Try assigning the ids to all of your elements, including the tds, divs, or whatever is around your draggable element.
Your function is returning a string rather than the div node.
In my case, there was no string on which i was calling appendChild, the object i was passing on appendChild argument was wrong, it was an array and i had pass an element object, so i used divel.appendChild(childel[0]) instead of divel.appendChild(childel) and it worked.
But it will not remove/hide the main DIV.
To hide the main div, do this:
In this example there is a list of same class names containing styled content (divs etc) -  add the .CloneMe class but first remove that class  to empty the div in case the user selects a different item.
Then apply the class using (this) to avoid grabbing all of the items with that class name and finally append to the div.
You need to set relative positioning on the container and then absolute on the inner tag div.
The inner tag's absolute positioning will be with respect to the outer relatively positioned div.
You don't even need the z-index rule on the tag div.
Being block elements, div's naturally have defined borders that they try not to violate.
Another toue to take would be to create div's using an image as the background, and then place content where ever you like.
You give your wrapper div a fixed height - 275px.
So if the inside div gets too big it flows out and over.
To hide and show div on button click in angular 6.
So,  <div *ngIf="expression" style="display:none;">
And,  <div *ngIf="expression"> Always give correct results.
Added "div style="clear: both">" at the bottom of the containing DIV.
As has been said already you need some method of forcing the containing div to realize the floating divs have taken up space.
To move the contents of here into there, this works, as long as here encloses everything you want to move, like a <div>:
If a fragment already has a parent elsewhere in the DOM (as div id='MacGuffin' does in example markup above), appendChild() quietly detaches the argument fragment from any current parent before reattaching under the new parent.
Add overflow:auto to div#form:
You can use display: inline-block for both those divs
Have a <div> with class="wrapper" for your content.
Right before the closing </div> of the wrapper place the
<div class="push"></div>.
Right after the closing </div> of the wrapper place the 
<div class="footer"></div>.
Try putting a container div (with overflow:auto) around the content and sidebar.
None of these pure css solutions work properly with dynamically resizing content (at least on firefox and Safari) e.g., if you have a background set on the container div, the page and then resize (adding a few rows) table inside the div, the table can stick out of the bottom of the styled area, i.e., you can have half the table in white on black theme and half the table complete white because both the font-color and background color is white.
Nested div multi-column layout is an ugly hack and the 100% min-height body/container div for sticking footer is an uglier hack.
Use absolute positioning and z-index to create a sticky footer div at any resolution using the following steps:
Create a footer div with position: absolute; bottom: 0; and the desired height
Create a container div that wraps the body content with position: relative; min-height: 100%;
Add bottom padding to the main content div that is equal to the height plus padding of the footer
Set the z-index of the footer greater than the container div if the footer is clipped
If the header is say 80px high and the footer is 40px high, then we can make our sticky footer with one single rule on the content div:
Which means: let the height of the content div be at least 100% of the viewport height minus the combined heights of the header and footer.
... and here's how the same code works with lots of content in the content div:[code snippet]
I have myself struggled with this sometimes and I always found that the solution with all those div's within each other was a messy solution.
You just wrap all page content except for the footer within in a div, and then set the min-height to 100% of the viewpoint minus the height of the footer.
No need for absolute positioning on the footer or multiple wrapper divs.
Short version: position:relative on the outer div, position:absolute on the inner div and tell it you want the inner div to be 0 pixels from the right and bottom edges of the parent container.
Apply float:left; to both of your divs should make them stand side by side.
Note: the space between these two child elements can be removed, by removing the space between the div tags:
if you want it before the last child div:
or if you want it before a specific div:
