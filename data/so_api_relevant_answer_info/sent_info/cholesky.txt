(I'm not promising that what you get out of tf.cholesky is in the right format to feed directly to scipy, or that you shouldn't just pull out the matrix in an earlier step and feed it to scipy, but this overall workflow should work for you).
For instance, checkout [tf.cholesky_solve (hyper-link)], [tf.matrix_solve_ls (hyper-link)], [tf.matrix_solve (hyper-link)], [tf.qr (hyper-link)], [tf.svd (hyper-link)], etc.
It uses Cholesky or LU Decomposition, depending on the input.
I'm not sure what version of matlab you are using, but I found [this discussion (hyper-link)], which suggests in older versions that Cholesky Factorization was very slow as you're describing.
I manged to get SIMD working with the Cholesky decomposition.
I don't know what to expect from Cholesky decomposition.
I realized that in the Cholesky algorithm there is something very similar
I'm sure there's a prettier way (in particular, numpy.linalg.cholesky), but this looks like it does ok on reasonable test data.
Here's what you have to do (I checked the result of the modified MPI program against a Cholesky decomp of your matrix in Octave -- it works.
They are only relevant if you have a big matrix and only want the Cholesky decomp of a submatrix.
Cholesky factorization in CUDA: [http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/~stg20/cuda/cholesky/ (hyper-link)]
There are actually two Cholesky factorization methods and it seems you need the other one, which returns a Cholesky variable.
From a Cholesky variable, you can extract an upper triangular factor by indexing with :U like so:
Some of these libraries provide also sparse Cholesky factorization methods and can be used directly.
There is definitely more that can be done to optimize the Cholesky of a banded matrix (in your case, pentadiagonal).
In particular, I would point you to an existing solution inside Python infrastructure: [scipy.linalg.cholesky_banded (hyper-link)].
I am not familiar with the Cholesky algorithm, but if it has to deal with very large and very small numbers internally, floating-point will provide more accurate results.
In particular, point 3 is unlikely to be the case for all the numbers throughout the entire stage of your computation, particularly for linear algebra operations such as Cholesky factorisations.
You don't lose accuracy when working with smaller numbers: this is particularly important for multiplication/division, which are used throughout Cholesky computations.
Cholesky Decomposition and
Linear Programming on a GPU.

Seeing as you are asking about a sparse Cholesky factorization, I assumed the matrix is symmetric positive definite.
Sparse Cholesky factorizations on a GPU is an open problem.
It can calculates sparse Cholesky factorization using multiple GPU on one host.
The cholesky algorithm is using a fill-reducing algorithm.
I do not know of a Java wrapper that performs a Cholesky Decomposition.
However, I can offer some help on your underlying problem, which is to perform a Cholesky Decomposition; I recently wrote a C++ program that performs a Cholesky Decomposition on a real, symmetric, positive-definite, matrix.
Batch Cholesky decomposition is now available in PyTorch.
You are looking for Batch Cholesky decomposition.
As of version 1.8, PyTorch has native support for numpy-style [torch.linalg (hyper-link)] operations, including Cholesky decompositions:
[SimplicialLLT (hyper-link)] computes the Cholesky decomposition up to a permutation.
If you have a symmetric matrix, a [Cholesky decomposition (hyper-link)] is a reasonable choice.
If your matrix is not symmetric, you can't use Cholesky or LDL decompositions -- use the [LU decomposition (hyper-link)] method instead.
Other special properties, such as the matrix being symmetric(Cholesky) or banded(Gauss) make the certain solvers better than the other.
We discussed this a bit in the answers and comments to this question:  [TensorFlow cholesky decomposition (hyper-link)].
be possible to port the [Theano implementation of CholeskyGrad (hyper-link)], provided its semantics are actually what you want.
Theano's is based upon [Smith's "Differentiation of the Cholesky Algorithm" (hyper-link)].
If still relevant, OCV 3.0.0 supports Cholesky directly through the HAL interface.
See [cv::hal::Cholesky (hyper-link)]
I once had a fast Cholesky written in Halide.
If your matrix is a long way from being positive definite, there's nothing you can do - the Cholesky factorization is based on the assumption that it is positive definite.
As pointed out by @Eli Sadoff, the cholesky factorization takes in a 2D matrix.
You print the matrix before calling Cholesky(), that is why the original matrix is printed.
Does Cholesky algorithm work in-place?
The correct values are not written into your matrix because the algorithm you employed for the cholesky decomposition is wrong.
The cholesky factorization can only be computed for symmetric (or hermitian) positive definite matrices.
Here is a Python package that does rank 1 updates and downdates on Cholesky factors using Cython:
[https://github.com/jcrudy/choldate (hyper-link)]
(Ported from MATLAB cholupdate at the Wikipedia page: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition (hyper-link)]):
Here, I'm just providing a full example showing how Cholesky decomposition can be easily performed using the potrf function provided by the cuSOLVER library.
Cholesky decomposition requires that the relevant matrix is Hermitian and positive definite.
Cholesky decomposition only works for positive-definite matrices.
So the Cholesky decomposition operation fails if the input argument isn't positive-definite, or - equivalently, in other words - when the input matrix has any negative eigenvalues.
There are two distinct cases why the eigenvalues of the kernel matrix might be negative: The most common reason is "almost positive" negative eigenvalues due to finite numerical precision issues - this is why we generally add a jitter matrix (diagonal matrix with 10^(-6) on the diagonal) before computing the Cholesky decomposition in GPflow.
You could just use [numpy.linalg.cholesky (hyper-link)].
Since Cholesky is only defined for matrices that are "Hermitian (symmetric if real-valued) and positive-definite" it would not work for it.
Anything you do to make it work would yeild a cholesky that will not be the Cholesky of the original matrix.
Another option is the chompack module: [chompack homepage (hyper-link)] chompack.cholesky
I use it myself in combination with the cvxopt module.
Nevertheless you see its just a line of code, and by throwing away all sanity checks and copying done by linalg.cholesky this could also be more efficient.
If your matrix is real valued you can do this without making a copy by simply passing the transpose to cholesky.
You need to pass the Cholesky decomposition to chol2inv:
Eigen's Cholesky modules do not support multithreading, but there are wrappers for external solvers in the [sparse module (hyper-link)].
The interesting sparse Cholesky solvers would be PaStiX (CeCILL-C, GPL-ish) or Pardiso (proprietary, Intel MKL).
For earlier versions cholesky method works with your example as is.
Cholesky factorisation is quite a simple algorithm.
The "Inver Symm" case test inverting a matrix using the cholesky decomposition.
If you get the source code for the benchmark there is also a pure cholesky decomposition test that you can turn on.
This is because the eigenvalues of the matrix K can decay
  very rapidly [...] and without this stabilization the Cholesky
  decomposition fails.
I just finished writing my own version of a Cholesky Decomposition routine in C++ and JavaScript.
scipy.linalg.cholesky is giving you the upper-triangular decomposition by default, whereas np.linalg.cholesky is giving you the lower-triangular version.
From the docs for scipy.linalg.cholesky:
If I modify your code to use the same random matrix both times and to use linalg.cholesky(C,lower=True) instead, then I get answers like:
I run a comparison on 1000x1000 matrices, and the Inversion through Cholesky was roughly twice as fast.
I just tested matrix inversion for a $2\times2$ matrix in Matlab using Cholesky decomposition followed by LU decomposition.
999999 repeats take 5 seconds using Cholesky and only takes 3.4 seconds using LU.
Indeed the algorithm of Cholesky followed by back substitution has a smaller big O result, but the result is an asymptotic result and only applies for big matrices.
if you are using parallel processing to run multiple inv or Cholesky you will find Cholesky to be faster.
Ordinary Cholesky factorization will fail, but pivoted version works.
The correct Cholesky factor here can be obtained (see [Correct use of pivot in Cholesky decomposition of positive semi-definite matrix (hyper-link)])
Pivoted Cholesky factorization can do many things that sound impossible for a deficient, non-invertible covariance matrix, like
's with rank-deficient covariance via Pivoted Cholesky Factorization (hyper-link)]);
AMD might support [Cholesky decomposition (hyper-link)] in the near future.
You can get approximate solutions by generating correlated normals using the Cholesky factorization, then converting them to U(0,1)'s using the normal CDF.
Actually you can, by using pivoted Cholesky factorization.
Pivoted Cholesky factorization is very useful.
's with rank-deficient covariance via Pivoted Cholesky Factorization (hyper-link)] gives a more comprehensive picture.
The problem with Cholesky decomposition of semi definite matrices is that 1) it is not unique 2) Crout's algorithm fails.
As of version 1.8, PyTorch has native support for numpy-style [torch.linalg (hyper-link)] operations, including both Cholesky decompositions and determinants:
The best approach appears to be to calculate Q using C^{1/2} as above and then use Cholesky to decompose Q to Q^{1/2} and then forward substitution to calculate Q^{-1/2}.
You can do this with a sequence of cholesky downdates:
If the cholesky factor of A is a, and of C is c, then the equation
for Q can be written
Finding the cholesky decomposition of
is known as a rank 1 cholesky downdate.
Cholesky decomposition requires not only a square matrix, but a Hermitian matrix one, and a positive definite matrix for uniqueness.
That said, a covariance matrix is symmetric postive semidefinite by definition, so you should be able to do cholesky on it.
Edit 
@chtz is right - using Upperwont give you the result you expect because LDLT class is for robust cholesky decomposition with pivoting.
So in in Addition to the correct answer of @Avi you can also use the right class for standard cholesky decomposition:
If the covariance is positive, it does Cholesky factorization, returning a full-rank upper triangular Cholesky factor;
The MCHOL routine is not just doing Cholesky decomposition, it is doing the steps of Cholesky and keeping track of the D diagonals that let it keep going.
It's a "modified" Cholesky.
Normal Cholesky needs a positive definite input, which the example is not.
[Wikipedia:Cholesky decomposition (hyper-link)]
Writing this using the cholesky decomposition we have
If cTc is an abstract product type, then it tries to instantiate a Cholesky factorization working on a an abstract product type which is not possible.
If you want a named Cholesky object, then rather use its constructor:
My advice would be to debug the code to look at the K matrix you obtain just before the Cholesky failure.
Eigen has a faster Cholesky solver
Eigen allows subviews by reference and has inbuilt optimization for solving Cholesky from these subviews
Armadillo runs every cholesky through a generic template to LAPACK/BLAS "auxiliary" libraries.
You did not use pivoting index to revert the pivoting done to the Cholesky factor.
Note, pivoted Cholesky factorization for a semi-positive definite matrix A is doing:
[code snippet]
where P is a column pivoting matrix, and R is an upper triangular matrix.
If a matrix A has cholesky decomposition, then A can be written as A=LL^T( which is feasible if A=QDQ^T and eigen values are all positive,  where L=QD^0.5) which implies that the matrix should be positive-definite(this subsumes the symmetricity also).
So you cant go from A = VDinv(V) to the form above for cholesky decomposition.
As to your main question, since positive definiteness is necessary and sufficient condition for cholesky decomposition to exist, isposdef() can be used to check if a cholesky decomposition exists.
There are two cholesky decompositions, one for each ldlt() call.
From that you can get all the matrices involved in the Cholesky decomposition.
Yes, Cholesky will still be faster.
IncompleteCholesky is a template class with 3 template parameters.
When you specify method="chol", rmvnorm will use the Cholesky decomposition with pivoting.
The cholesky function will see it as a 4x3, not a 4x4.
Here's the problem: The return value of cholesky is not properly defined.
Take out the definition of the cholesky array, and do not assign to it at the end of the function.
Intel Fortran identified that you are using s incorrectly in Cholesky.
Different methods as calculating the Cholesky Decomposition or using eigenvalues yield different matrices C that fit the formula R = CC^T.
If we take a look at [aten/src/ATen/native/native_functions.yaml (hyper-link)] and search for cholesky we find
To find the entry-point you basically just have to search the .cpp files in the [aten/src/ATen/native (hyper-link)] directory and locate the function named cholesky.
If input parameter uplo is CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_LOWER, only lower triangular part of A is processed, and replaced by lower triangular Cholesky factor L.
For example, if uplo is CUBLAS_FILL_MODE_UPPER, upper triangle of A contains cholesky factor U and lower triangle of A is destroyed after potrfBatched.
This is the reason that the cholesky factorization is failing.
To see the particular method that is called for objects of type Cholesky you can use @which as follows:
If you check the source code in [cholesky.jl:339 (hyper-link)] you find the following:
With tolerance tol = .Machine$double.eps, X'X will be seen as rank deficient, thus LU and Cholesky factorization will break down.
Generally, we switch to SVD or QR in this situation, but pivoted Cholesky factorization is another choice.
Pivoted Cholesky is fast, with acceptable stability.
Using Pivoted Cholesky factorization
Then dsyevr converges very quickly and should outperform the Cholesky approach easily.
Cholesky decomposition should be quite stable, if the input matrix is actually positive definite.
The Cholesky decomposition creates a lower-triangular matrix.
what about computing the cholesky decomposition first and inverting the lower triangular matrix after by back substitution.
This should be faster than linalg.cholesky(linalg.inv(S)).
Perhaps you should explore setting tolerances in Numpy's Cholesky routine.
So it's not surprising that cholesky fails
The class you are referencing is equotation solver (which indeed uses cholesky decomposition).
A Cholesky LLT or LDLT decomposition is useful because chol(A) can be used for both purposes.
The function np.linalg.cholesky raises an LinAlgError if the decomposition fails.
[LAPACK (hyper-link)] has a number of Cholesky decomposition routines (they call it Cholesky factorization).
According to Golub's book "Matrix Computations", Cholesky factorization can be applied to PSD matrices, but numerical stability tends to suffer.
You mentioned that the matrix is not suitable for Cholesky decomposition.
Since the Cholesky decomposition can be formed for any positive definite matrix, the implication is that your matrix is not positive definite.
The standard Cholesky decomposition (chol(A)) in matlab decomposes a symmetric (positive-definite) matrix, A, into upper-triangular form.
This returns a CholeskyPivoted, which is indeed what you want.
This may be clearer if you examine how a [CholeskyPivoted is represented (hyper-link)]; A will be used for that UL field.
If you already have the Cholesky decomposition (A = L * L_t), then you just have
The Cholesky decomposition takes O(n^3) operations and the product of diagonal elements of L is only O(n).
det(A) = product(eigenvalues(A)) = product(diagonal(choleskyFactorization(A)))^2
With [A.llt().solve(I) (hyper-link)], you assumes A to be a SPD matrix and apply Cholesky decomposition to solve the equation Ax=I.
It seem's that in your __init__ function, your sigma_ind parameter has default value of None which would be a problem in case that you don't pass sigma_ind during initialization because scipy.linalg.cholesky expect value.
Using javah produced a header file cfd_optimization_Cholesky.h with a declaration
I can't think of a function doing that for you automatically, but given you have the cholesky factor L, it's easily done in one line by reconstructing the A matrix as defined by the decomposition A=LL' :
edit: be aware that in R, the definition of the Cholesky factor is related to A = L'L, which is why you have to put the transposed first in the solve.
The forward- and back- substitution steps of Cholesky decomposition method are very fast but not vectorizable, so numpy can't help much.
np.linalg.solve tries to solve the simple forward substitution step by naively applying LU substitution, so it takes much longer than a purpose-built function (or even not using Cholesky at all).
If you just want to perform cholesky factorization - you can just use np.linalg.cholesky
The return value of performcholesky, for example, is a pointer to a local variable that does not exist anymore after performcholesky has returned, and you overwrite a pointer to allocated memory with this dangling pointer, leaking that memory.
It seems that in your case the tests based on SVD and Cholesky give different results.
Here cholesky.solve(b) has a type different to lu.solve(b) and neither has an implicit conversion to the other.
It doesnt use Cholesky, it uses LU decomposition, which is I think about half as fast, but they are both O(n^3), so comparable.
chol.default from R base calls LAPACK routine dpotrf for non-pivoted Cholesky factorization, and LAPACK routine dpstrf for pivoted Cholesky factorization.
The reason that upper triangular factor is more commonly seen in statistics, is that we often compare Cholesky factorization with QR factorization in least squares computation, while the latter only returns upper triangular.
To answer your second question: No, knowing a Cholesky factorization (LL^T or LDL^T) is of no use for the eigenvalue problem.
Cholesky decomposition is straightforward with torch.cholesky:
The Cholesky algorithm will fail if the matrix is not positive definite, so it may be best to implement oneself, which would also have the advantage that one would have control over what to do when the algorithms fails because the input isn't positive definite.
I use C# rather than Matlab for my mathematical programming, and my Cholesky implementation is only a handful of lines, so it's not difficult.
A quick'n'dirty test of this with matrices M=sprandsym(n,n,d)+c*speye(n,n), some of which are PD and some of which are not (twiddling n, d, and c), seems to indicate that it identifies many, but not all, SPD matrices (as expected), but is very cheap compared to eig() (and its underlying Cholesky) for "large" n. For your particular matrices, it might work or it might not.
For comparison, [Cholesky decomposition (hyper-link)] is O(n^3).
(see  Darren Engwirda's comment below about Cholesky).
The problem is not with the cholesky factorization.
First, for PSD matrices Cholecky (cholesky/cho_solve) should be better.
it contains neither the Cholesky decomposition nor the matrix square root of Σ, but its inverse and the scalar square root of its determinant.
A solution to this is given by the [Cholesky decomposition (hyper-link)], so the natural choice is
The Cholesky decomposition does however have the disadvantage that it is only defined for positive-definite Σ, while the requirement of the matrix square root is merely that Σ is nonnegative-definite (sqrtm returns a warning for a singular input, but returns a valid result).
Have a look how _solve_impl is implemented for SimplicialCholesky.
It looks like Cholesky decomposition does not directly help here, but I cant tell for sure at the moment.
The method stable_cholesky_solver does the job of solving for the square root using the stable decomposition lldt() that uses pivoting.
It’s possible that SimplicialLDLT is spending a ton of time computing the Cholesky factorization—which it won’t find successfully since your matrix isn’t positive definite.
Find the Cholesky decomposition of B=LL^T by [LAPACK ?potrf (hyper-link)].
First, forget about exact methods such as Cholesky (+reordering).
But commonly, you are given a covariance matrix, and you want to find C.  If you use the Cholesky decomposition to find C, then by construction it will be lower triangular.
In Eigen's Cholesky solvers, rank-updates are available only for dense solvers, e.g.
The error that you received was generated when you called cholesky.
cholesky requires that your matrix be positive semidefinite.
I think that cholesky is just being fussy.
However, you may run into issues if you end up with some inducing points very close to each other (this can make the K_{zz} = cov(f(Z), f(Z)) matrix badly conditioned, which would explain why the Cholesky fails).
The error you get (Error in Cholesky(crossprod(from), LDL = FALSE) : internal_chm_factor: Cholesky factorization failed" error) is likely because your design matrix is singular.
Issue was that cholesky of matrix inverse has a transpose compared to just the inverse of the cholesky of the original matrix.
For matrices of this size, computing the Cholesky factorisation directly should be the most efficient approach.
If, for instance, your matrix A is very sparse it may be possible to compute the sparse Cholesky factorisation A = L*L' directly.
You should always use at least the simple diagonal [Jacobi preconditioner (hyper-link)], although usually much better performance can be realised using more sophisticated approaches such as [incomplete Cholesky factorisation (hyper-link)] or possibly [algebraic multi-grid or multi-level methods (hyper-link)].
Increasing the Likelihood Noise should help, since that effectively adds a small value on the diagonal of the matrix you try to decompose via Cholesky.
The matrix being symmetric, positive-semidefinite, the Cholesky decomposition is strictly superior to the LU decomposition.
It seems that in your case, LDLT (a variation of Cholesky) wins
So I would start with classical Cholesky and simply abort factorization if the diag terms become to small with respect to some sensibly chosen tolerance.)
Cholesky is pretty simple to code, and if you strive for a really fast code, it is better to implement it yourself.
Like others above, I recommend cholesky.
I've found that the increased number of additions, subtractions and memory accesses means that LDLt is slower than cholesky.
There are in fact a number a number of variations on cholesky, and which one will be fastest depends on the representation you choose for your matrices.
I generally use a fortran style representation, that is a matrix M is a double* M with M(i,j) being m[i+dim*j]; for this I reckon that an upper triangular cholesky is (a little) the fastest, that is one seeks upper triangular U with U'*U = M.
They are only relevant if you have a big matrix and only want the Cholesky decomp of a submatrix.
If I understand correctly you want to simply ignore columns (or variables), you don't even need to recompute the Cholesky decomposition from scratch but efficiently down-grade it instead which you can do using orthogonal transformations e.g.
It has Cholesky decomposition.
Your X^TX matrix should have a Cholesky decomposition.
It is faster: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholesky_decomposition (hyper-link)]
Form A^T A x = A b, then Cholesky-factorise A^T A = L L^T, then do two back-solves.
This usually gets you an answer precise to about machine epsilon --- twice the precision as the Cholesky method, but it takes about twice as long.
For sparse systems, I'd usually prefer the Cholesky method because it takes better advantage of sparsity.
First of all, let's assume that all your matrixes are of order n x n. The cholesky factorization can then be done in O(n^3/6) operations (for large values of n).
Solving B*c(i) = y(i) or L*L'*c(i) = y(i) (Cholesky) is 2*O(n^2/2)  or O(n^2), but solving BC=Y is solving n of these equations (because Y is n x n), so at total we have O(n^3).
Solving E in BE = A in the second formula is backwards substitution of cholesky factorization once more, so O(n^3)
However, calculating inv(B) when knowing the cholesky factorization of B is O(n^3) (because solving L*L'*inv(B) = I is the same as solving BE=A)
So we then have: O(n^3/6) (cholesky of B) + O(n^3) (calculating inv(B) with cholesky) + 4*O(2n^3-n^2) (four matrix multiplications) ~ O(9*n^3) which is a little bit better, but still worse.
It works very similar to the cuSOLVER routines used to [Solving general sparse linear systems in CUDA (hyper-link)], but uses a Cholesky factorization A = G * G^H, where G is the Cholesky factor, a lower triangular matrix.
I would avoid Matlab altogether, and instead use the Incomplete Cholesky Decomposition available in PyMC2:
For example, instead of taking the Cholesky factorization of a covariance matrix constructed from your data, introduce a unit lower triangular matrix L and a diagonal matrix D. Impose lower bound constraints D[i, i] >= 0 for all i in 1:size(D,1), and nonlinear equality constraints L * D * L' == A where A is your covariance matrix.
Then use L * sqrtm(D) anywhere you need to operate on the Cholesky factorization (this is a possibly semidefinite factorization, so more of a modified Cholesky representation than the classical strictly positive definite L * L' factorization).
(sorry for the ugly formulas...)
Now you just need to solve the [image]-Matrix using Cholesky decomposition or whatever...
With the cholesky function, from my understanding I believe the only real solution is calling a new variable inside the scope of the function, I wish this could be avoided for memory issues, but then again, if I want to store the original A and create a new matrix of the same size, I believe that the overall memory consumption would not be altered much.
Checking the textbooks you need the cholesky decomposition A of the covariance matrix S
