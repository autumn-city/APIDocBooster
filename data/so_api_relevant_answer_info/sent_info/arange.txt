numpy.arange does the same thing as python's range: It doesn't include the "endpoint".
As noted in the documentation for arange:
the help of arange function says
I had the same problem and I implemented my own function to correct for this rounding issue with numpy.arange :
So the float64 value that np.arange assigns to myarr[1] is not exactly the same float that Python uses to represent 6.65.
a concatenation of aranges for all the values in a.
After your edit which explains you want a list of aranges, I think this would be more effective:
Running arange(0.0,0.6,0.2) I get:
Regardless, from the numpy.arange docs: Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) (in other words, the interval including start but excluding stop).
In the example below, orange does the job of numpy.arange
As mentioned by [KasrÃ¢mvd (hyper-link)] in the comments, the issue is a bit more complex, as floating point rounding errors can occur in numpy.arange (see [here (hyper-link)] and [here (hyper-link)]).
To clear up things a bit for myself, I decided to stop using [numpy.arange (hyper-link)] if not needed specifically.
Therefore np.arange(10)[:, None] would produce the same exact result as the above solution.
This method doesn't use the numpy.arange function, though I find it more readable.
array function in Python is _array_fromobject() in C, and arange function in Python is array_arange() in C.
numpy.array and numpy.arange are written in C. You can tell because they say "built-in" when you look at them:
numpy.array and numpy.arange correspond to _array_fromobject and array_arange in that file.
I think "arange" is from Numpy.
If you want the Numpy "arange", then you will need to import Numpy.
However, arange and plot are not some of them.
that allows you to call unqualified function names like arange and plot from your script and, second one
Use np.arange(962240400).reshape((31020,-31020)), it is a function of numpy, not a method of the array m1
use arange in place of arrange.there should only one 'r'
From the [numpy.arange (hyper-link)] documentation:
As is writen in [numpy.arange documentation (hyper-link)],
From the arange docs:
arange's stop (the second argument) is excluded in output.
According to arange docstring:
arange([start,] stop[, step,], dtype=None)
[np.arange (hyper-link)] documentation states:
You can implement your own arange method using linspace:
In your first attempt, tbins = np.arange(tmin, tmax, 0.001), you are mixing large and small floats in a single computation.
In your second attempt, nbins = tmin + np.arange(0, tmax-tmin, 0.001), the summations in the np.arange(0, tmax-tmin, 0.001) part are all very accurate, because the huge number tmin is left out, and only added on in the end.
The examples in the Numpy documentation don't include using np.arange with steps, so here's one:
timearray = np.arange('2000-01-01', '2000-01-02',np.timedelta64(1,'h'), dtype='datetime64')
arange generates evenly spaced 1D ndarray in range [1,limit+1] in your example.
Then you may use [arange (hyper-link)] to generate each component of your 2D ndarray.
You convert result of arange to a python list with list(), to make it the right format to be an argument of ndarray constructor.
You seem to misunderstand what [np.arange (hyper-link)] does:
r_ converts a slice into an array of numbers using np.arange.
A web search and some experimenting shows that np.arange(np.nan) produces this error message:
: I removed the -dx from the upper limit (L/2 - dx => L/2) because arange already excludes the last point, which you can see because the result never ends with L/2 which is 5.
If they were precise, np.arange(1.1, 1.12, 0.01) would be array([1.1 , 1.11])
[np.arange (hyper-link)] specification mentions that as well: For the stop argument it writes:
For cases in which you need the explict index using enumerate(arange(...)) is both compact and readable.
np.arange(1, -1) creates an array starting from 1, adding a step (default is 1), and ends when the value is larger or equal to the stop value.
np.arange(1, -1, -1) would take steps of -1, and create an array [1, 0], stopping just before -1.
The arange function dates back to this library, and its etymology is detailed in its manual:
arange() is a shorthand for arrayrange().
You can first create the 2D arange using repeat
According to the docs for [np.arange (hyper-link)]:
The reason is that by clamping the ends, linapace can make some assurances about the cumulative error which arange can not.
The linapace call corresponding to np.arange(0.5, 1.1, 0.1) is
Also according to the arange docs (the return value):
Try using numpy.arange(..., dtype=numpy.double) or cast the result with astype(np.double)
I'm betting this has nothing to do with overflow as some folks have suggested and everything to do with the default dtype for np.arange.
If you pass in an integer start, stop, and step to arange, then the output will be an integer array.
arange = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)
np.allclose(arange, [[0,1,2,3,4],[5,6,7,8,9],[10,11,12,13,14]]) == True
[The np.arange documentation: (hyper-link)]
Alternatively, if you 
really want to keep using np.arange, and you're sure that there is an integer number of steps between the start and end values, you could add a small number to the end value, so that the rounding off does not matter (or subtract it, if you do not want the end value to be encluded in your list).
np.arange works by repeatedly adding the step value to the start value, and this leads to imprecision in the end:
My mistake was forgetting objects require to be Set, so with Dim aRange As Variant, instead of:
Here's a variation of @Developer's answer that only calls arange once:
Here is an idea: You can check if the upper limit of the degree range is lower than the lower limit then create arange in two step procedure.
this might seem a little longer but if you are keen on using np.arange this is  how I worked it out:
Your arange without the dtype raises an error:
This is a pretty weird way to call arange.
Given the fact that ARange is only one column wide:
Since by necessity all of the aranges need to be equally long, we can create an arange along the first entry and then replicate it for the others.
writes :
Dim aRange As Excel.Range
arange is compiled code, so we can't readily examine its logic (but you are welcome to search for the C code on github).
np.arange warns about float steps:
An alternative to your list comprehension, is to scale an integer arange
Don't use np.arange[], it is a function object not a sequence.
np.arange[[...]] attempts subscription (c.f.
list indexing l[0] or dictionary access by key d['key']), which doesn't make any sense - arange is a function; and
np.arange([...]) passes a single list argument, when arange actually takes (up to) four separate arguments.
If you are interested in having a list of cosines out of your np.arange() product, you could do:
Calculating the length up front doesn't save you from the problems of a non-integer step, and you'll frequently get the "wrong" endpoint anyway, for example, with [numpy.arange(0.0, 2.1, 0.3) (hyper-link)]:
While arange does step through the range in a slightly different way, it still has the float representation issue:
Aside from the different representation of lists and arrays NumPys arange works by multiplying instead of repeated adding.
arange can handle float steps, but with a warning.
Because you are passing an exponentinal, non-integer value to the step parameter of the arange method.
np.arange), or explicitly import only exactly what you need in your script.
numpy.arange([start], stop[, step], dtype=None)
You can do something similar with arange:
1:n is the same as arange(1, n+1, 1) where the first 1 is start, n+1 is stop, and the last 1 is step.
It's like trying to arange r2 elements into a r1 x r3 grid.
This will essentially reshape an r1*r3 arangement into shape (r1, r3).
"TypeError: arange: scalar arguments expected instead of a tuple."
It sounds to me like you are trying to use the shape of an existing array to define the shape of a new array using np.arange.
If I try to use just x.shape to define a argument in np.arange like this:
"arange: scalar arguments expected instead of a tuple."
Reason being np.arange accepts either a scalar (which creates an array starting at 0 and increasing by 1 to the length provided) or 3 scalars which define where to start and end the array and the step size.
you are giving the arange function the first scalar in the tuple provided by x.shape and in my example producing an array like this [0,1] because the first index in the tuple is 2.
arange generates lists (well, numpy arrays); type help(np.arange) for the details.
If you must loop, prefer xrange/range and avoid using np.arange.
(Something like the worst thing you could do would be to iterate over the array with an index created with range or np.arange as the first sentence in your question suggests, but I'm not sure if you really mean that.)
The elements of arange(3) are used to select elements of foo to construct a new array.
correct_answers = scores[np.arange(num_train), y[np.arange(num_train)]]
This does the thing I wanted to do, props to the other dude which gave me the idea
From arange docs:
The reason is that you are using np.arange() with a non-integer step, which is [known to be inconsistent (hyper-link)].
Taken from [np.arange() documentation (hyper-link)]:
I do not think you can avoid for loops as such, but you can use list comprehension and np.arange() , which should be a bit faster than normal for loops.
has a dtype=int, because np.arange uses dtype=int by default.
In your controller you do $aRange = Range::find($name):
What sprung in my eye is that you're using a negative step for numpy.arange to express the distance between two adjacent values, out[i+1] - out[i].
Using arange with floating-point arguments is generally a bad idea.
arange is like python's range function.
Like Milan mentioned, my first thought was to use np.arange(0, 0.55, 0.01) but I just ran it, and it only goes from 0 to 0.54, which made me think it was treating the ending point as exclusive.
To that end, i bumped it up to np.arange(0, 0.56, 0.01), but then that returned everything up to 0.56.
You can use np.arange and then reshape to fit the shape of rxn_probability:
If it is still of interest to you, you could get rid of one for loop and use numpy.arange() in combination with list comprehension and numpy.hstack() to get what is desired.
Having said that we would still need at least one for loop to get this done (because neither range nor arange accept a sequence of endpoints)
the method numpy.arange is defined in a binary file numpy/core/multiarray and its doc is generated in numpy/add_newdocs.py (line ~1321).
Because there is no def arange() Intellisense has no clue what the arguments are.
Note that just like python's range, np.arange does not include the end in the created range, hence unless the floating point error results in a value greater than the step in the end of the range, it will not be included.
arange returns a numpy array, which supports vectorized operations.
Specifically in this case, numpy.arange().__rpow__(int()) is invoked due to the operator and operands (respectively ** and int().__pow__(numpy.arange()) previously having returned NotImplementedError).
It selects values based the 0 and arange(5), and appends the : dimension at the end.
aRange.Columns.AutoFit();
In your first snippet of code:
arange(0,1.54) returns array([ 0.,  1.])
Something like arange(0, 7, 0.1) then, for the next step in your for loop, you use .loc with index with dataframe instead of row, df.loc[index,'CO_1'] = 'GOOD' instead of row.loc['CO_1'] = 'GOOD' :
The problem is that objects are mutable, so myFn could do range.min = "foo"; range.max = "bar"; and it would be allowed by the Range type, but then aRange would be a NumberRange with strings!
Since arange(c) is computed for each i, and arange(3) for each couple (i, j), computing them once and for all outside the loop could save some time:
hist(data, bins=arange(0, 121, 1), weights=repeat(1.0/len(data), len(data)))
[array (hyper-link)] and [arange (hyper-link)] are part of the [numpy (hyper-link)] package which needs to be installed additionally by executing
aRange is a constant integer, but not an integer constant.
In C, you can't write const uint8_t aRange = a[1] - a[0]; at file (global) scope, so your code should have been OK unless you're using an antiquated C compiler that doesn't recognize C99 or later (or it defines __STDC_NO_VLA__).
[numpy.arange (hyper-link)] returns an array of non-consecutive numbers.
The [arange function (hyper-link)] takes an optional step parameter:
np.arange and np.linspace are generally used to return evenly spaced numbers.
arange specifies step explicitly, while linspace use (stop-start)/(num-1) to calculate the step implicitly.
You just need to specify the step parameter of np.arange.
[http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html (hyper-link)]
I left out aRange since I noticed you never even use it.
You can take advantage of the following broadcasting trick, to create a 2dim indices array from two 1dim aranges:
So depending on the other lines the inner line could be either np.arange(a*b) or np.arange(1,a*b).
