After importing the ABS Module (from File > Project Structure) and making sure it has Android 2.2 and Support Library v4 as dependencies, I was still getting the following error as you @Alex
If you need access to the resources of a library project (as you do with ABS) ensure that you add the library project/module as a "Module Dependency" instead of a "Library".
In this example I used [PagerSlidingTabStrip library (hyper-link)] (just download ZIP from GitHub, rename library directory to „PagerSlidingTabStrip" and copy it).
To resolve this problem, you just need to add the abs resource path to your project build file, just like below:
There shouldn't be an abs() in the global namespace (it's std::abs()).
In math.h, due to its primitive nature, the abs() function is "essentially" just for integer types and if you wanted to get the absolute value of a double, you had to use fabs().
It improved things like having to distinguish between fabs() and abs, and just made abs() for both doubles and integer types.
In summary either:
Use  math.h and use abs() for integers, fabs() for doubles
or
use cmath and just have abs for everything (easier and recommended)
Use fabs() instead of abs(), it's the same but for floats instead of integers.
In my cases, I solved the problem when using the labs() instead of abs().
ABS() is most likely a macro, meaning it's a copy-pasta of some code into your application, whilst abs() is probably a function.
abs() works on int, meaning abs(-10.123) would return 10, while ABS() is a macro from NSObjCRuntime.h which returns a value whose type is the type of the argument.
The ABS definition from NSObjCRuntime.h is :
abs on the other hand has the protoype
The way the ABS macro in NSObjCRuntime.h is defined avoids this by introducing an extra variable, but some DIY macros might not, e.g.
If on the other hand you want to use the stdlib abs() function then be warned that it will not work with long integers.
In that case you should use labs().
[math.fabs() (hyper-link)] converts its argument to float if it can (if it can't, it throws an exception).
It then takes the absolute value, and returns the result as a float.
In addition to floats, [abs() (hyper-link)] also works with integers and complex numbers.
math.fabs() always returns float, while abs() may return integer.
So it seems abs() only has slight speed advantage over fabs() for integers.
For floats, abs() and fabs() demonstrate similar speed.
So abs() is faster than math.fabs().
abs() :
 Returns the absolute value as per the argument i.e.
abs(a+bj) also works and returns absolute value i.e.math.sqrt(((a)**2)+((b)**2)
math.fabs() :
 It only works on the integer or float values.
Always returns the absolute float value no matter what is the argument type(except for the complex numbers).
The abs, labs, and llabs functions compute the absolute value of an integer j.
The absolute value of the most negative number cannot be represented in two’s complement.
I think the way abs works is to first check the sign bit of the number.
abs(0x80000000) is therefore undefined in the two's complement since it is too large, due to this the machine just gives up and gives you 0x80000000 again.
The abs() function now checks the signbit, sees that it is set and computes the positive value.
So, to answer your original question, the absolute value of the most negative number in a two's complement representation cannot be represented in that encoding.
Probably the library version of abs is an intrinsic function, whose behavior is exactly known by the compiler, which can even compute the value at compile time (since in your case it's known) and optimize the call away.
If there's still a difference, it may be because the library abs is written directly in hand-forged assembly with magic tricks, so it could be a little faster than the generated one.
This means the sign has it's own bit, and an absolute value is merely clearing that bit.
are you sure the first call uses std::abs?
It could just as well use the integer abs from C (either call std::abs explicitely, or have using std::abs;)
However, I'm surprised the compiler doesn't eliminate the loop altogether - since you don't do anything with any effect inside the loop, and at least in case of abs, the compiler should know there are no side-effects.
There are well-known tricks for computing the absolute value of a two's complement signed number.
Your version of abs is inlined and can be computed once and the compiler can trivially know that the value returned isn't going to change, so it doesn't even need to call the function.
falls into the following "fabs" code path (in msvcr90d.dll):
abs call the C runtime 'fabs' implementation on MSVCR90D (rather large):
In release mode, the FPU FABS instruction is used instead (takes 1 clock cycle only on FPU >= Pentium), the dissasembly output is:
The library abs function operates on integers while you are obviously testing floats.
This means that call to abs with float argument involves conversion from float to int (may be a no-op as you are using constant and compiler may do it at compile time), then INTEGER abs operation and conversion int->float.
After some inspector clouseau detective work, i came up with one possible answer: maybe <cmath> and <cstdlib> define only "abs(int)' in the global namespace, while the full set of declarations (int + overloads) are defined exclusively in 'std::".
This possibility is upheld by the fact that if you use <cmath>/<cstdlib> in the code above and you change the call into "std::abs()" then you get the "ambiguous" error (i.e.
If I remember vectors properly :
Given two vectors P and Q, with say P = (x, y) and Q = (a, b)
Then abs(P) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2) and P. Q = xa+yb.
So that cos@ = P. Q/(abs(P) *abs(Q)).
Because in python, 3+4j is complex number and python calculates the absolute value or magnitude of the complex number when you do abs() on it.
As the rest of the answers stated above, 3+4j is a complex number and the formula of calculating the absolute value of a complex number x+yi is sqrt( (x^2) + (y^2) ).
Because for complex numbers abs(number) will return magnitude of Complex Numbers.
So abs with complex number will return magnitude of complex numbers.
for further reference you can use [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/abs-in-python/ (hyper-link)].
You could do array_walk_recursive($numbers, 'make_abs');
Check that you're in fact using std::abs from <cstdlib> and not std::abs from <cmath>.
Oh, just saw the example program, well, there you go, you are using one of the floating point overloads of std::abs
.
You cannot guarantee that std::abs(x) will always return |x| for all arithmetic types.
For example, most signed integer implementations have room for one more negative number than positive number, so the results of abs(numeric_limits<int>::min()) will not equal |x|.
It's not weird that g++ (with C++11 standard) returns a double when you use std::abs from <cmath> with an integral type:
From [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/abs/ (hyper-link)]:
Use fabs
Use fabs()
fabs
[http://www.manpagez.com/man/3/fabs/ (hyper-link)]
abs() takes an integer as an argument and returns an integer result.
The function to use here is fabs() for doubles or fabsf() for floats.
use fabs()
There is a also a gcc bug report [std::abs (long long) resorts to std::abs (double) if llabs is absent (hyper-link)], which questions if this implementation is correct and one response says:
The bug report eventually lead to [LWG active issue 2192: Validity and return type of std::abs(0u) is unclear (hyper-link)] being filed which says amongst other things:
In C++11 the additional "sufficient overload" rule from 26.8 [c.math]
  p11 (see also LWG 2086) can be read to be applicable to the std::abs()
  overloads as well, which can lead to the following possible
  conclusions:
Any translation unit including both  and  might be ill-formed because of two conflicting requirements for the return type
  of the overload std::abs(int).
It seems to me that at least the second outcome is not intended,
  personally I think that both are unfortunate [...] It should also be
  noted, that the corresponding "generic type function" rule set from
  C99/C1x in 7.25 p2+3 is restricted to the floating-point functions
  from  and , so cannot be applied to the abs
  functions (but to the fabs functions!
The question is whether this was intended to apply to abs as well.
This could be a defect since there does not seem to a way to interpret the current wording to exclude abs.
The proposed solution would make std::abs(0u) ill-formed:
If abs() is called with an argument of unsigned integral type that
  cannot be converted to int by integral promotion ([conv.prom]), the
  program is ill-formed.
While some may question the notion of using abs with an unsigned type Howard Hinnant points out in the report that when using templates such consequences may not be apparent and provides an example:
On most systems, abs (INT_MIN) is not defined.
For example, on typical 32 bit machines, INT_MAX = 2^31 - 1, INT_MIN = - 2^31, and abs (INT_MIN) cannot be 2^31.
abs(INT_MIN) will invoke undefined behavior.
The abs, labs, and llabs functions compute the absolute value of an integer j.
Edited to add explanation: Of course the difficulty is that -INT_MIN or abs(INT_MIN) will be undefined if -INT_MIN is too big to fit in an int.
If it is, then INT_MAX is the smaller of the two absolute values.
If not, then INT_MAX is the larger of the two absolute values, and -INT_MIN is the correct answer.
But calculating min(INT_MAX, abs(INT_MIN)) isn't portable.
First, [abs() (hyper-link)] takes and returns an int.
You should use [fabs() (hyper-link)], which takes and returns a floating-point value.
Now, the abs() you're ending up calling is actually a GCC [built-in function (hyper-link)], which returns an int, but apparently accepts a float argument and returns 0 in that case.
Almost certainly what's happening is that in your MSVC case it's picking up the C++ abs float overload (which is probably being brought into the global namespace for some reason or other).
If you #include <cmath> and use std::abs it should work fine on all your platforms.
math.h has the C version of abs which operates on ints.
Use <cmath> for the C++ overloads or use fabs() for the C floating point version.
When you use the abs() function it flips the bits then adds one to negative numbers to make them positive.
A look at a reference for [std::abs (hyper-link)] tells us what's going wrong:
Computes the absolute value of an integer number.
In 2's complement systems, the absolute value of the most-negative value is out of range, e.g.
You are calling abs() wrongly.
There is a function int abs(int x) in stdlib.h.
Many functions (including abs) are known well to the gcc compiler.
abs is a [builtin (hyper-link)] in GCC, but Clang replaces builtins with calls to their respective library functions.
To fix this, you can rename your function (which is recommended; see below for the reasoning) you can compile your code using -fno-builtin-abs, or you can mark your function as static.
The ISO C90 functions abort, abs, acos, [...] and vsprintf are all recognized as built-in functions unless -fno-builtin is specified (or -fno-builtin-function is specified for an individual function).
If you define abs as static, the call will not be removed.
abs is a function defined in the C standard, it's prototype is provided as int abs (int) by #include <stdlib.h>.
However, even without including that header, gcc has build-in knowledge about abs and knows what it is supposed to do.
As you very likely do not want to use -ffreestanding, you can use -fno-builtin-abs to take away built-in knowledge about abs, same for many other functions.
Even with -fno-builtin-abs option, you can use __builtin_abs in your code if you prefer the optimized version of absolute value computation and no libcall to libc.a / libc.so.
You have an error because abs could not be used for list.
Or you could use list comprehension to set your abs_list:
You are probably confusing numpy's abs, which will happily work on lists and arrays, with __builtin__.abs, which only works for scalars.
I gather that you want abs applied to each member of the list slice along with some other computation, since you use slice notation.
The TITLE-ABS-KEY search takes the TITLE+ABSTRACT+KEYWORDS fields as whole, making those 3 fields into just one and then running a text search.
The TITLE() OR ABS() or KEY() searches those 3 fields separately.
"TITLE-ABS-KEY is going to find all results for any or all of those
  three criteria with the keywords.
TITLE OR ABS OR KEY is going to give
  only results where three criteria don't overlap.
add this header file and try to use abs() built-in function and see that work or not.
This is not a problem with using abs() but with using logical expressions.
As already pointed out by francescalus you are taking absolute value of pic1(1,j,1).eq.fitra(i) which does not make sense in fortran (the value is either true or false and cannot be put in absolute value).
Matlab for instance would convert it to integer and happily give you abs(1), which would be 1.
You probably intended to do abs(pic1(1,j,1)) .eq.
std::abs is an overloaded function, not a template function.
Note that I also removed the () you put after abs, since this is a function and not a class that needs to be instantiated.
[std::abs is not a template (hyper-link)].
Also std::abs is for integral types.
You should be using [std::fabs (hyper-link)] for floating point types.
You can use those wrappers like you wanted to use std::abs in your question.
By the way, 'abs' is a function defined in the following file: ~/anaconda3/envs/tensorflow/lib/python3.6/site\
-packages/tensorflow/python/keras/_impl/keras/backend.py
Solution found from [GitHub: ImportError: cannot import name 'abs' #20778 (hyper-link)].
You can try to modify "int a = abs(x);" ==> "int a = ::abs(x);"
For information, abs(x)>=abs(y) is a logical array for which, for all valid indices, the kth component is
You must use std::abs, which has overloads for the primitive types.
abs() is not defined in SurfaceView.
Try Math.abs(int).
Do you actually want to use the java.lang.Math.abs(int value) function?
In this solution, we find the max and min values and compare Max with the absolute value of Min.
Use llabs() instead:
abs takes an int as an argument, for a long long use [llabs (hyper-link)]
Abs() function returns real results, so currency variable casts to real.
compiler watch reveals the same value for abs(vtemp1) and vtemp2
Try to add x : real, then call x := abs(b);, add x to watches list, select it and press Edit watch, then select Floating point.
so, if you need absolute value of Currency variable - just do it.
don't use floating-point abs():
That is because Abs(A) returns a float value, and A = Abs(A) is implemented as a float compare.
But the second sample is also a potential bug because B:= Abs(A) internally is a float division/multiplication by 10000 with rounding to Currency (int64), and depends on FPU rounding mode.
I have just found out the hard way that Delphi XE2 Abs function does not overload the currency type.
these are the only types supported by abs
function Abs(X: ): Real; overload;
function Abs(X: ): Int64; overload;
function Abs(X: ): Integer; overload;
That seems to be [a compiler bug (hyper-link)], if you are using abs(x) in a static context.
CAST(ABS(CHECKSUM(Indicator)) % 450 as TinyInt) as an id number 
if i am not wrong
Passing floating point numbers to abs you will get a floating point number as result.
In that case you can experience problems with the floating point representation: a floating point is never absolutely precise, thus you are most likely getting a number that is not exactly 0.50 but something like 0.500000...01.
Due to the way floating point math works, your absolute value $logic results in this value:
If you don't want to round as suggested by @Aldo's answer and your server supports the GMP math functions, you could use [gmp_abs() (hyper-link)] instead.
You got blue ActionBar without using ABS because you're using Samsung TouchWiz default UI.
C didn't provide any overloads: abs took an int, and was
declared in <stdlib.h>, fabs took double, and was
declared in <math.h>.
Roughly speaking, either you included <cmath>, and prefixed
all of the uses with std::, or you included <math.h>, and
used fabs if you wanted support for floating point (and the
various suffixes for types other than int or double).
(So it doesn't apply to abs, but only
to fabs.)
Include either <math.h> and
<stdlib.h>, and use abs/fabs and their derivated (e.g.
labs, fabsf, etc.)
exclusively, or include <cmath>, and
use std::abs exclusively.
EmguCV is an OpenCV wrapper which also wraps OpenCV's abs() function to calculate the absolute of each pixels value in an image.
For single values just use C#'s Math.Abs()
man page for abs() ([https://linux.die.net/man/3/abs (hyper-link)]) says #include <stdlib.h>.
So in C++ you should #include <cstdlib> and use it as std::abs() to be completely conformant.
cppreference ([https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/abs (hyper-link)]) also mentions <cstdlib> can be used, but also mentions <cmath>.
Following overloads of abs are defined in both cstdlib and cmath headers, within namespace std and can be propagated to global namespace:
And to be honest, I'm pretty sure that you don't even need the abs(b-a) or abs(a-b), because they will be "abs-ed" in the next function call, right?
And if you want to get rid of abs altogether, then you an simply mimic its behavior in your code:
You can use ABS() on the results of some [Date and Time Functions (hyper-link)], such as DATEDIFF, or on the difference between two TO_SECONDS() calls.
In the official [MySql Date and Time Documentation (hyper-link)], There is no method for ABS() or even to estimate the closest date.
to absoluteRef because the tag variable contains the '[' character.
then absoluteRef would be given the value
See this post for the same question (and implementations): [XSLT: can we use abs value?
The abs function is part of XPath version 2.0 and as that supported in XSLT 2.0 processors like Saxon, AltovaXML and XMLPrime.
Since abs(10) = 10, and 10 % 100 = 10, then abs(10) % 100 = 10.
The abs operator is the absolute operator.
Therefore, 10 % 100 must be 10 and, thus, also abs(10) % 100 must be 10.
There is no Abs function overload for the Integer type.
The built-in Abs function has the following prototype and so it is not usable with integer types:
ABS() finally forces it to be a positive integer.
If you are using the support library you should discard using the ABS.
Both compiler actually return 288.0625 for std::abs1, but GCC output 288.62 (floor) and VC 288.063 (ceil) - This is not a "problem" in std::abs, but a "problem" in the way output is formatted2.
1 Both compilers return a less approximated value with std::abs because you are using float for std::abs while you are using double with std::sqrt.
Replace 6. and 288. by 6.f and 288.f or std::complex<float> by std::complex<double> and you will get the same result with std::sqrt and std::abs.
you bring the following overloads of abs into scope:
The call abs(f) resolves to std::abs(float).
there is only one abs function that you are able to use.
Hence, the call abs(f) resolves to abs(int).
You can still remove the using namespace std; line and use std::abs(f) instead of just abs(f).
You're probably using abs from the Foundation framework.
Why is abs not in std?
abs is in std.
Let me assume that you're asking "Why is abs also in the global namespace?
The C++ alternative is to declare your abs in your namespace:
We thus can unify the absolute value D to the head of the list of the third parameter, and recurse on the tail Ds:
ABS 4.3.x is screwed up.
ABS 4.3.x is screwed up.
You are instantiating an anonymous class that is extending the class ABS.
And you can instantiate this anonymous class because it defines all the abstract methods in ABS(Thanks Nebelmann)
It is the same if you create a class like public class Foo extends ABS that implements the absMetod()
and you can do: ABS bar = new Foo()
you are implementing the abstract method absMetod() while creating anonymous class that  extends  ABS class
The absolute value of any number (real or complex) is defined as the length of the vector from the origin to its point on the Argand plane.
Note here you are trying to use std::abs<std::complex<float>>.
If you replace T in the signature of std::abs, you get this:
I believe the function you intended to use was std::abs<float>, which would result in a signature like this:
Also you should remove the int abs; in the while loop.
You need to make sure that you also import the abs_ function - in case you did not from gurobipy import *.
Use fabs (or fabsf for float instead of double) rather than trying to reinvent it.
Use fabs() as people have said above.
If you really really really want to inline, chain your compares:
inline float abs(float a)
{
    return (a > 0.f) ?
In your code, the abs function is doing its job correctly.
The missing function Abs was added:
You can combine the functions as [shown in Yonik's examples (hyper-link)]: sum(abs(profit_amount)) as the facet function should work.
abs expects int.
Recall that the absolute value function returns the magnitude of a number.
You're passing the absolute value function a signed int number, to which it returns a number which is then interpreted to be a signed long number from an int.
If you were to make that long a unsigned long, and use labs instead of abs, the result would be positive.
When the literal is passed to the abs function, the argument is converted to int and the result of the conversion is INT_MIN.
abs(INT_MIN) is not representable in an int (-INT_MIN is an integer overflow in two's complement systems) and invokes undefined behavior (abs specifications says that If the result cannot be represented, the behavior is undefined.)
Why does math have an fabs function?
Both it and the abs builtin function
    wind up calling fabs() for floats.
abs() is faster to boot.
Nothing deep -- the math module supplies everything in C89's standard
  libm (+ a few extensions), fabs() is a std C89 libm function.
There isn't a clear (to me) reason why one would be faster than the
  other; sounds accidental; math.fabs() could certainly be made faster
  (as currently implemented (via math_1), it endures a pile of
  general-purpose "try to guess whether libm should have set errno"
  boilerplate that's wasted (there are no domain or range errors
  possible for fabs())).
It seems there is no advantageous reason to use fabs.
Just use abs for virtually all purposes.
In base R, abs is a primitive:
In Spark, abs is a wrapper around a call to the Spark engine:
In base R,it can be applied to any vector, but in SparkR, it can only be applied to columns.Suppose you have a dataframe and C3 column is double, you can use following code to add one column C4 to dataframe, which is the abs value for C3.
Solved atma thank's abs() realy doesn't work directly in orderBy but as an alias.
Obs: It's a doctrine limitation, not a mysql limitation, mysql suports abs direct on order by part.
In this case you can unroll the abs function:
This could work: Abs(CDbl(DataArray1(i))) < Abs(CDbl(DataArray2(i)))
fabs and comparison are both really fast for IEEE floats (like, single-integer-op fast in principle).
So once you've fabs'ed, I think that a branch-free max for int will also work for float (assuming they're the same size of course).
fabs() might not be an inline function.
There is a branchless fabs documented on [http://www.scribd.com/doc/2348628/The-Aggregate-Magic-Algorithms (hyper-link)]
Please also note that recent versions of GCC will inline a branchless fabs for you, using MMX instructions.
So, setting the most-significant bit to 0 will be the same as calling fabs().
For your purpose you could square it instead of taking the absolute value; as mathematically |a| < |b| if a^2 < b^2 and vice versa.
Multiplication might be faster than fabs() on some machines(?
Its a capital A on Abs: [https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a4ke8e73(v=vs.110).aspx (hyper-link)]
Put your cursor on the words abs and press CTRL+SPACE and it will correct it for you
The right syntax of those methods are [Math.Abs (hyper-link)] and [Math.Min (hyper-link)]
abs has different implementations depending on how it is included.
Reference [cppreference abs(float) (hyper-link)]
std::abs takes any of:
abs() is declared in cmath header.
So,  if you want to use abs(), You need to include cmath in your code like this :
Note : From C++11 and more versions , We can use abs() in the following way :
Reference : [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/abs/ (hyper-link)]
So in your case when you are doing abs(fp(x)) the problem seems to be that you are doing abs() on None that's why you get the error.
Casting complex(I,Q) as double before calling abs() may be an option.
I believe the abs() function expects a double, complex double or single as input to compute the magnitude.
If you're looking to just take the absolute of the components calling abs() on channels/vectors I and Q before calling complex() may be an option.
[Rcpp::abs() (hyper-link)] requires an Rcpp object, e.g.
Negative numbers seem reasonable, but you can include ABS():
You didn't think to mention it (I inferred it from your tests with np.abs), but it's important that x is a numpy.int64 (or equivalent signed 64 bit type).
That specific value, in [two's complement (hyper-link)], has no positive equivalent, so abs just produces the same value again (it could be made to raise an exception, but numpy stuck with the low level C behavior where it returns the original value in this case).
abs(int(x)) and it will work.
If you want to handle all cases correctly, you can't just subtract and then take the absolute value.
which is -1; when you take the absolute value, the result you get is 1, whereas the actual difference between the two numbers is 0xffffffff interpreted as an unsigned integer (UINT_MAX).
To get this value (with 2s complement hardware), you just subtract the smaller input from the larger and interpret the result as an unsigned integer; no need for an absolute value.
Assuming that your integers are in MMX or XMM registers, use psubd to compute the difference, then pabsd to get the absolute value of the difference.
If your integers are in the plain, "normal" registers, then do a subtraction, then the cdq trick to get the absolute value.
Old thread but if I surfed in here late you might have too...
abs is a brilliant example so this should be here.
This is how the C library function abs() does it  in assembly without branching:
BONUS (from [Hacker's Delight (hyper-link)]): If you have  a fast multiply by +1 and -1, the following will give you abs(x):
ABS(EAX)
You can workaround this by mapping Abs to abs, like lambdify(x, f(x), ["numpy", {'Abs': numpy.abs}]).
That works in this way:
If ABS() can be applied to 'name' the numeric resulting value will be ordered, but in the opposite case, if ABS(name) evaluates to null (because a non numeric has no abs value) then the second field (name) on order by, is which is relevant to the sort.
I removed the ABS from the query and while handeling the query I use this:
The problem is you're using abs(int) when you need fabs(double) or better in C++, std::abs().
You said you tried std::abs(), but if you had it would have fixed your problem.
Never use abs() without std:: on the front.
The claim that abs return int in C++ mentioned in other answers is completely incorrect.
In C++ standard library function abs is overloaded for different argument (and return) types.
If <math.h> was included, then abs should have called double abs(double) and generated a proper result (barring a broken compiler).
If <stdlib.h> was included (and no <math.h>), then the call should have resulted in overload resolution failure due to availablity of both abs(int) and abs(long).
This applies in equal degree to both abs and std::abs.
Note that using std::abs instead of abs does not have any effect on this problem at all: the set of overloaded functions is the same in both cases.
If in the OP's case the int version of abs was called, it would be a quirk of the implementation.
because sed doesn't know in your text, which case is an absolute-value notation, which case is an logical or notation, or bit-wise "or" operation.
Firstly, let your MainActivity extends Activity instead of SherlockActivity..and then right click on your project goto properties->Andrioid..scroll down and remove ABS library and apply..In manifest if u have applied any theme then change it to @style/AppTheme..and that should be it..
In addition to removing the ABS Library and extending MainActivity from Activity instead of SherlockActivity... you have to make sure all of your activities are switched.
I'd suggest in a separate branch deleting ABS and see where the errors are and go from there.
Use Math.abs()
abs() is a static member of the Math class, so call
Math.abs(number)
import static java.lang.Math.abs;
As Brian says, use Math.abs().
This will allow you to use just abs() (and all other static methods from the Math class) without prefixing them with Math.
Also, be sure to use getSupportMenuInflater over getMenuInflater when using ABS.
ABS() stands for absolute, it doesn't return integer necessarily.
man abs tells you why you got that result: abs -- integer absolute value function
You want fabs here: "floating-point absolute value function".
Note that you need to include math.h (abs is usually in stdlib.h).
The reason we have abs(long) and labs(long) (while both are equivalent) is that labs() is a remnant of the C library.
C doesn't have function overloading, so function abs() can only take one type (int) and the long one has to be called differently, hence labs.
Yes, in C++ there's an overload for abs() that takes a long argument.
labs() is necessary for C programmers, they can only use the abs() function that takes an int.
abs and labs are from C where there is no function overloading.
long abs(long) is the same as long labs(long) in C++.
It is likely the case that abs() is either a macro defined like:
Thus, the resulting value of abs() adopts the same type as its argument.
For an int type argument, abs(INT_MIN) may or may not be well defined, since it might cause signed integer overflow.
You have changed the type of the argument to abs() to be a long long, initialized by an int.
So, if dvs is (long long)INT_MIN, then abs(dvs) is -(long long)INT_MIN, a positive number so long as sizeof(int) < sizeof(long long).
As I've answered in your other question, have you tried to contact the vendor(Absolute database producer) and ask some advice from it?
But, I agree with Radu: if you're in good standing with the Absolute people, they should be able to help you.
Run the AbsDB Manager on a Windows machine, export the data, move it to OSX and import to MySql there.
[Absolute Database (hyper-link)] also target Delphi XE2 as of version 6.20.
So... you should be able to use the bitwise & operator to clear that bit to get the absolute value.
Your passsing string to abs which is valid in case of scala with $ Operator which consider string as Column.
you need to use abs() method like this abs(Dataframe.Column_Name)
For your case try this one:
df1.withColumn("abslat", abs(df1.lat))
I can't give a good reason for why abs couldn't be constexpr and apparently neither can gcc.
abs.cpp:6:20: error: constexpr variable 'abs3' must be initialized by a constant expression.
intmax_t abs(intmax_t);
which shall have the same semantics as the function signatures intmax_t imaxabs(intmax_t) and
  imaxdiv_t imaxdiv(intmax_t, intmax_t), respectively.
By means of a brief illustration, abs satisfies all three criteria; however, functions such as exp, sqrt, cos, sin fall foul of the first criterion and so are excluded as constexpr candidates.
i tried the syntax .... | int | abs on ansible 2.5 and got the same error, while on ansible 2.4 it works.
You can try scripting using groovy lang which has abs function.
You can simply use Math.abs(...) method in painless scripts.
If you want to operate on plain Python numerics just stick to [Python's built-in abs (hyper-link)].
Python has built-in abs method.
pyspark also provides abs method but that is for DataFrame column.
If you do import pyspark method 'abs' in pyspark shell then you do override built-in abs method.
It looks like you have override abs method something like below:
In your case, the abs-constraint admits more solutions!
Please note how abs is resolved!
Create a header file of your own that defines an inline functionabsolute that in turn includes all the correct headers and fixes bugs with return types, and calls std::abs.
Then, don't use abs or std::abs (or any token named abs).
[Here is (hyper-link)] related discussion in ABS group.
You are not including the correct header for the floating-point overloads of std::abs:
And for std::abs you should include the header cmath :
Documentation : [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/abs/ (hyper-link)]
EDIT : But the function abs declared in cstdlib has as prototype :
(hyper-link)] The ABS(numeric_expression) function [Returns the same type as numeric_expression.
(hyper-link)] Apparently, the ABS function returns a default float, [which is float(53) (hyper-link)].
This is an aggregate pipeline operator so you have to use within aggregate function not just { $abs: -1 } as you show in your question.
If you look at other symbols you might find an index (or section name if the reader does the mapping for you) in place of *ABS*.
Not so for absolute symbols (having special value SHN_ABS as their st_shndx).
Absolute symbols don't get relocated, their virtual addresses (0000000000000000 in the example you gave) are fixed.
Such absolute symbols are sometimes used to store some meta information.
The compiler doesn't know that it's going to be an absolute symbol, so it produces the code it does (as for a normal symbol).
I found this [answer (hyper-link)] shedding light on the proper use-case for absolute symbols.
Abs() start to support integers at 1.30 and doubles at 4.10 version.
If that does not help than isolate and debug abs() via screen-space shader and  use it output as fragment color.
abs should be imported from tf.keras.backend (tf.keras.backend.abs) seems you are importing tf.python.keras.
Sadly, awk does come with an abs() function built-in.
C++: MatExpr abs(const Mat& m)
The requirement is not clear but use of ABS should not cause sorting issues.
=ABS (for absolute) function is to strip out minus signs (so seems to be working properly).

abs is declared in stdlib.h.
Your compiler should have complained that abs was not declared.
You havn't included <stdlib.h> which declares abs.
This means calling abs( 1.5 ); , the compiler assumes there's a int abs(double) function somewhere, and it will generate code to call that.
So what are you expecting if someone will pass a char to the abs function.
An example of a type for which abs makes sense but this implementation does not is complex<double>.
Currently, std::abs(x-y) < 2 fails if x and y are unsigned.
abs(3u-4u) would be much larger than 2, in fact it's UINT_MAX.
There are some ways to compute abs without branching but this one is not one of them as < and ?
In C++, it's always sufficient to use std::abs; it's overloaded for all the numerical types.
In C, abs only works on integers, and you need fabs for floating point values.
It's still okay to use fabs for double and float arguments.
I prefer this because it ensures that if I accidentally strip the std:: off the abs, that the behavior remains the same for floating point inputs.
I just spent 10 minutes debugging this very problem, due to my own mistake of using abs instead of std::abs.
I assumed that the using namespace std;would infer std::abs but it did not, and instead was using the C version.
Anyway, I believe it's good to use fabs instead of abs for floating-point inputs as a way of documenting your intention clearly.
There is one more reason to recommend std::fabs for floating-point inputs explicitly.
If you forget to include <cmath>, your std::abs(my_float_num) can be std::abs(int) instead of std::abs(float).
"abs" and "fabs" are only identical for C++ float types, when they can be translated without ambiguous overload messages.
Together with template usage and especially when using mpreal there are cases with hard "ambiguous overload" messages - abs(static_cast<T>(x)) isn't always solving that.
When abs is ambiguous, there are chances that fabs is working as expected.
for abs and sqrt, crying for different solutions.
abs(x) is differentiable at every real x, but zero.
You probably just want the derivative of Abs to be sign.
SymPy does do this, but only if it can deduce that the argument to the absolute value is real, which it can't in this case (even if x is real).
You can make your own custom version of Abs that always uses sign pretty easily by subclassing and overriding the _eval_derivative method:
It looks like you setup the dependencies between your main module and ABS through the Studio/IntelliJ UI.
Since Studio delegate building to Gradle, the dependencies needs to be setup in build.gradle, and ABS needs to be built with Gradle as well.
Absolute Database is a file based database, kind of like a proprietary version of SQLite.
As far as I know there are no libraries for accessing Absolute Database other than ComponentAce's own Delphi components.
There is a free for personal use version of the Absolute Database components which comes without source code, but it still requires you to use Embarcaderos Delphi or C++Builder development environment.
abs() gives the [absolute value (hyper-link)] of a number, which means it makes negative numbers positive.
Since abs( v ) and abs( bestTemp ) return the positive version of both numbers, abs( v ) < abs( bestTemp ) will be true if v is lower in magnitude (or "closer to 0") than bestTemp.
The absolute value of minBound cannot be represented as a member of the type Int, so you end up getting an overflowing value.
This overrides the TextView's (defined in ActionBarSherlock/res/layout-large/abs__action_mode_close_item.xml) android:text attribute.
My Visual C++ 2008 didn't know which to choice from long double fabs(long double), float fabs(float), or double fabs(double).
abs() is declared in stdlib.h and it will deal with int value.
fabs() is declared in math.h and it will deal with double value.
In C++, std::abs is overloaded for both signed integer and floating point types.
std::fabs only deals with floating point types (pre C++11).
Note that the std:: is important; the C function ::abs that is commonly available for legacy reasons will only handle int!
is not that there is no conversion from int (the type of -9) to double, but that the compiler does not know which conversion to pick (int -> float, double, long double) since there is a std::fabs for each of those three.
C++11 solves this by adding double fabs( Integral arg ); which will return the abs of any integer type converted to double.
In general, just use std::abs, it will do the right thing.
With C++ 11, using abs() alone is very dangerous:
Always use std::abs():
You can avoid the unexpected result with using namespace std; but I would adwise against it, because it is considered bad practice in general, and because you have to search for the using directive to know if abs() means the int overload or the double overload.
This code multiplies the value of v with -1 or 1 to get abs(v).
Here is another approach without abs(), if nor any logical/conditional expression:
assume int is 32-bit integer here.
casting the value to unsigned would have the desired effect: (unsigned)v << 1 >> 1 does get rid of the sign bit, if there are no padding bits, but the resulting value is the absolute value of v only on systems with sign+magnitude representation, which are vanishingly rare nowadays.
I will suggest you to do the absolute conversion(abs) in pivot source query
Assuming that the compiler won't be able to determine that both abs() and conditional negation are attempting to achieve the same goal, conditional negation compiles to a compare instruction, a conditional jump instruction, and a move instruction, whereas abs() either compiles to an actual absolute value instruction, in instruction sets that support such a thing, or a bitwise and that keeps everthing the same, except for the sign bit.
Every instruction above is typically 1 cycle, so using abs() is likely to be at least as fast, or faster than conditional negation (since the compiler might still recognize that you are attempting to calculate an absolute value when using the conditional negation, and generate an absolute value instruction anyway).
Even if there is no change in the compiled code, abs() is still more readable than conditional negation.
The "conditional abs" you propose is not equivalent to std::abs (or fabs) for floating point numbers, see e.g.
However, the abs function as specified by IEEE754 mandates the signbit of the result to be 0, which would forbid the result -0.0.
I personally think anything used to calculate some "absolute value" should match this behavior.
But as std::abs (or the fitting C equivalents) are known to be correct and easier to read, you should just always prefer those.
As well as it's easier to read that abs is taking the absolute value than reading that if it's less than zero, negate it.
If the compiler is "stupid", it may well end up doing worse code for a = (a < 0)?-a:a, because it forces an if (even if it's hidden), and that could well be worse than the built-in floating point abs instruction on that processor (aside from complexity of special values)
Consider that you could feed a complicated expression into abs().
For example, the CPU might have an abs instruction, or a way to extract the sign bit without the overhead of a branch.
Supposing an arithmetic right shift can fill a register r with -1 if the number is negative, or 0 if positive, abs x could become (x+r)^r (and seeing 
Mats Petersson's answer, g++ actually does this on x86).
Why use abs() or fabs() instead of conditional negation?
Various reasons have already been stated, yet consider conditional code advantages as abs(INT_MIN) should be avoided.
There is a good reason to use the conditional code in lieu of abs() when the negative absolute value of an integer is sought
When a positive absolute function is needed and value == INT_MIN is a real possibility, abs(), for all its clarity and speed fails a corner case.
The intent behind abs() is "(unconditionally) set the sign of this number to positive".
it was as simple as adding "fabs" instead of "abs"
due to the Foat datatype
Write your own abs.cc with the above code (no inline) and it will supersede the library definition.
<math.h> is responsible for abs(int)
<cmath> is responsible for std::abs(double)
Hence, wherever there is an abs found, a compiler error will be reported for its void as return value.
This compiler error can be used for replacing such abs() with std::abs().
For harmless abs(int), this will expectedly not generate any error as it's available in <math.h>.
You need to create rules in your .l file for "abs" and "sqrt"; declare the tokens they will each return via %token; and use those token names in the grammar rules: ABS "(" expr ")" : ...
You can try explicit Int as parameter as mentioned here it may be a bug :
[Ambiguous use of operator '-' in Swift with 'abs()' (hyper-link)]
The issue is that libc++ is not entirely C++11 compliant with the integral overload for [std::abs in cmath (hyper-link)]:
This is situation very likely to change due to [LWG active issue 2192: Validity and return type of std::abs(0u) is unclear (hyper-link)].
See [Is std::abs(0u) ill-formed?
Just replace the std::abs calls with util::abs.
The abs() takes only one argument, a number whose absolute value is to be returned.
When using ABS don't use Activity or fragment, you must use SherlockFragmentActivity and SherlockFragment.
You can for exemple have ONE SherlockFragmentActivity that contain your ViewPager or tabs, and a SherlockFragment in EACH tabs.
The ABS can be retreived in every SherlockFragmentActivity with :
The function you are using is actually the integer version of abs, and GCC does an implicit conversion to integer.
Actually, the GCC documentation for that option explicitly mentions calling abs when the argument is a double.
Then, when you've created your tabs in the other activity, you can select the one that's specified in the incoming intent:
Just calling plot_implicit(Eq(x+Abs(x), y+Abs(y))) draws the equation with some default bounds.
if you convert from abs() to fabs().
because abs is for 32 bit and fabs for 64 bit.
The FFT gives you both the magnitude and phase for each frequency component, but after abs only the magnitude remains.
short int is "an integer type", so bullet #2 kicks in and causes generation of a wrapper which calls double abs(double) and this wrapper is a better match than int abs(int).
For each set of overloaded functions within , with the exception of abs, there shall be additional overloads suffcient to ensure:
"a" gets new value after executing (*a) = abs(*a + *b); , so now "b" gets the latest value of "a" , that's why it gives 4 instead of 1 (a=4+5=9,b = 9-5=4).
*b = abs (*a - (2 * (*b));
*b = abs (9 - (2 * (5));
*b = abs (9 - (10));
*b = abs (-1);
For cabs you just need [<complex.h> (hyper-link)].
Since you doesn't have any arithmetic operation which may cause overflowing of the type T it is absolutely safe to "cancel" promotion to int
This function returns the absolute value of n being n an int variable.
This function returns the absolute value of parameter n as long int type instead of int.
This function returns the absolute value of parameter n as float type variable.
The difference is clear, you should use the correct version of abs() deppending on the parameter variable type you are using, the wrong usage may result in [undefined behavior (hyper-link)] namely due to [signed integer overflow (hyper-link)].
abs() takes an integer as a parameter and also return an integer, 
fabs() takes and returns a floating point type like a float or double
labs() takes and returns a long int.

More efficient than both due to the lack of abs(), and clearer to boot.
Also, the 2 statements mean different things, for example, try abs(newpos - oldpos) = 0.5 and see, unless the two variables are integers.
The second is more efficient if you remove the unnecessary abs().
However, the two conditionals don't seem equivalent; what happens if abs(newpos-oldpos) == 1?
When abs(newpos-oldpos) == 1 you get different results.
abs(new-pos) > 1
Abs
abs(newpos-oldpos) != 0
Abs
Jmp - If abs is inlined and the last operation appropriately sets the zero flag.
Of course, the best performance will be given by getting rid of the pointless abs() entirely:
Keep in mind that these findings may not apply on other architectures; however losing the abs is sure to be faster anywhere.
By the way, if you'd meant abs(newpos - oldpos) >= 1 for the first test, it still generates the absolute value sequence.
On my machine, for example, abs(-2147483648 - 2147483647) gives 1 which would fail your test if you were looking for a delta of say, 2 or more instead even though they're clearly quite different.
Thus, if x is positive or zero, y is zero, and x + y is x, so (x + y) ^ y is x, which is the absolute value of x.
So x - 1 XORed with all ones produces -(x - 1) - 1 = -x + 1 - 1 = -x, which is the absolute value of x except when x is the minimum possible value for the format (−2,147,483,648 for 32-bit two’s complement), in which case the absolute value (2,147,483,648) is too large to represent, and the resulting bit pattern is just the original x.
Note that while the above proofs are passable for a general explanation, the reality is that these proofs don't cover important edge cases, like x = 0x80000000 , which represents a negative number greater in absolute value than any positive X which could be stored in the same number of bits.
and in a second step this is used to calculate the integer abs()
why I use this kind of code:
* compile-time checks
* works with all Integer sizes
* portable from small µC to modern cores
* Its clear, that we need to consider the two's complement, so you need an unsigned return value, e.g for 8bit abs(-128)=128 can not be expressed in an signed integer
An ".s19" or an ".abs" file contains mainly the machine code of the application.

abs(), then f has a kink and y is still smooth and 1 times differentiable
This is because derivatives that are computed using if-statements, modulus operations (abs()), or things like unit step functions, dirac delta's, etc., will introduce discontinuities in the value of the solution or its derivative(s), resulting in kinks, jumps, inflection points, etc.
If one does not want to use an array formula, one can use a helper column to get the ABS of the number row.

Change abs() to intval() or cast it to int ( c-style)
If you want 1.5, then you do not want to order by abs(column_1 - 1.2).
I don't know whether it inlines Math.Abs or not... but have you verified that this is actually a performance problem for you?
As noted by Anthony, the above won't (normally) work for int.MinValue, as -int.MinValue == int.MinValue, whereas Math.Abs will throw an OverflowException.
C# does inline Math.Abs.
For what it's worth, absolute value of a 32-bit signed, 2's complement format int is usually implemented like this:
abs(x) = (x^(x>>31))-(x>>31)
See [http://graphics.stanford.edu/~seander/bithacks.html#IntegerAbs (hyper-link)] for how to compute absolute value without branching.
Whilst .Net supports inlining, I doubt that Math.Abs() would be considered a candidate for inlining by the compiler.
I did some performance tests, to find out whether you can actually save time using something besides the standard Math.Abs.
Basically you can get a very slight improvement over Math.Abs, but nothing spectacular.
With the bit hack you can shave of a little of the time required for Math.Abs, but readability suffers severely.
C# does inline Math.Abs(), here is the C# and assembly code (generated using the online tool [SharpLab (hyper-link)]) of Math.Abs:
The Activity  com.android.internal.view.menu.MenuItemImpl of ABS have a method toString() that was giving NullPointerException because "androi:title" attribute wasn't set for my Menu items.
To get the absolute sum, you simply use np.abs to get absolute values of each element and then perform the task as follows.
In all cases the types should have a compatible memory layout (I think), so the worst case is that a bit of type casting should let you use any implementation's abs function.
To add to the confusion, if you look at the generated Cython code (search through the various #if CYTHON_CCOMPLEX blocks in the generated file) it appears that Cython defines fast versions of abs (and other useful functions) for all these types, but fails to use them intelligently, falling back to the Python implementation.
If you're going through C you need to tell Cython about cabs from complex.h:
If you're going through C++ you need to tell Cython about the C++ standard library abs.
If the abs() function returned unsigned, then it would cause this kind of type promotion of other values when it was used in an expression, which would cause unexpected results.
Note that, for complex numbers, std takes the absolute value before squaring, so that the result is always real and nonnegative.
To summarize my answer there,   Abs is defined generally on complex numbers.
Abs[z] is not a [holomorphic function (hyper-link)], so its derivative is not well defined on the complex plane (the default domain that Mathematica works with).
More simply put, Abs[z] depends on both z and z*, so should really be thought as a two argument function.
It seems to take the derivative assuming the Abs is in the real domain, then substitutes in the numeric/complex arguments.
I'm going to quote straight from the docs : ["Prototypes for abs, labs and llabs are in stdlib.h" (hyper-link)]
This should explain why abs(intmin) = intmax holds for MATLAB (but not necessarily in other languages).
This oddity has an interesting side-effect, however: you can assume that abs never returns a negative number.
[abs() (hyper-link)] is a built-in function, so just replace all occurrences of math.abs with abs.
As others pointed out, abs is builtin so it isn't imported from the math module.
If abs works, your function succeeds.
If you supply something abs doesn't know how to handle a ValueError will be raised an it will return your error message.
The python math module doesn't have an abs function as this functionality is provided by basic Python.
However, looking at the documentation page for python math [here (hyper-link)] you can see that they do in fact have a fabs function.
What you want is fabs.

You need to set a ABS theme or let your theme extend from an ABS theme.
Here is some information regarding [ABS-theming (hyper-link)]
The snippet's comments are wrong (as is much of the ABS; it's a very poor reference and should not be used).
First off, what you are doing doesn't really make sense out of context (getting the absolute value of an unsigned type).
Changing abs to llabs like so:
See the documentation of the different abs functions for integer types [here (hyper-link)].
From [[c.math.abs]/29.9.2.3 (hyper-link)]:
If abs() is called with an argument of type X for which is_­unsigned_­v<X> is true and if X cannot be converted to int by integral promotion, the program is ill-formed.
It also doesn't really make sense to call std::abs on an unsigned type anyways.
You can create your own overload of abs if you want to manage unsigned types in a way that is different for what the standard library function does:
Please, note that std::abs promotes chars (signed in my implementation), but due to 2's complement representation of ints, fails to retrieve the absolute value of INT_MIN.
labels = function(x) abs(x)
abs is a C function that takes one integer and returns another integer.
You want to use the C++ version std::abs instead.
Clang would actually warn about the mistake (I even turn it into an error -Werror=absolute-value), not sure if there is a similar flag for gcc (not warning about all conversions, just for abs).
Looking at the declaration of [abs (hyper-link)] inherited from C (Because you included stdlib.h)
And [abs (hyper-link)] in C++ (from cmath)
Using abs to guarantee c is a positive number.
I don't know whether you'd regard it as making sense, but abs() applied to an unsigned value can certainly return a value other than the one passed in.
That's because abs() takes an int argument and returns an int value.
If the high bit of the unsigned value is set, then the result of abs() is not the value that was passed to the function.
The subtraction is merely a distraction; if the result has the most significant bit set, the value returned from abs() will be different from the value passed to it.
You can make the code compile if you add (in)appropriate casts to the calls to abs(), and the absolute value of a signed quantity can be different from the original signed quantity, which is hardly surprising news:
One option is to plot the real & imag components separately but that’s usually not as interesting as the magnitude/abs (real-squared plus imag-squared): real versus imag can tell us the behavior of the phase of the signal, which for real signals is usually random and uninteresting, whereas the magnitude combines the real and imag components and tells us in a straightforward way the amount of energy in a given frequency bin—useful!
abs is a static method and in order the compiler knows where it's defined, you have to specify the class (in your case - Math).
Note that you could do a static import on Math.abs and then you'd be able to just do abs(-100) instead of Math.abs(-100).
abs is implemented via a template, which returns the type in which the original value was stored.
The result will always be valid, as the absolute value of an signed integer will always fit in its original data type.
The short answer is that this is done so that the return type of abs is the same as its input type.
Mostly, when calling abs, you're dealing with an equation where all elements are of the same type (or you'd get warnings) and you want to use the magnitude of some variable in that equation.
So, in short, it is more common and more natural to want the same input and output type when asking for the absolute value of a signed variable.
You're using the [abs defined in <cstdlib> (hyper-link)], which only works on integers.
Use the [abs defined in <cmath> (hyper-link)] instead.
First of all: the abs() calls are entirely redundant if you are squaring the result anyway.
Next, you may be reading the profile output wrong; don't mistake the cumulative times with the time spent only on the function call itself; you are calling abs() many many times so the accumulated time will raise rapidly.
It is not that the abs() function is slow; it is calling any function that is 'slow'.
You can alleviate one of those pain points by making abs() a local name outside the loop:
Not that abs() really is taking such a huge toll on your performance, really, not when you time your functions properly.
Maybe maybe maybe you have a chance to find some non-safety features with this method but finding security functionalities like ABS is heavily in doubt.
The reason this is correct is that signed-to-unsigned conversion is defined to return 2^N+v for negative v; unary minus for unsigned integers is defined as 2^N-v; thus regardless of signed integer representation this code returns the absolute value properly.
The behavior of abs(-0x8000000) is certainly well-defined (both uint32_t and int32_t contain ±0x8000000 in their valid range if those types exist.
The C++'s abs function is taken from C, and the C standard says (§7.20.6.1/2):
The abs, labs, and llabs functions compute the absolute value of an integer j.
259) The absolute value of the most negative number cannot be represented in two’s complement.
So the result of abs is undefined.
The simplest way is to use the abs function.
The signature for abs():
Taking the absolute value of unsigned type 'uint32_t' (aka 'unsigned
  int') has no effect
Which begs the question, why do you need the absolute value of an unsigned integer?
All you need to do is declare your variables and literals quadruple precision, and use the generic versions abs and sign.
Now to the abs, floor, ceiling, and round functions.
The Neg interface defines abs with the following type:
So you will need to do some simple type casting to implement abs : Int -> Nat.
abs(x)
      Return the absolute value of a number.
If x defines __abs__(), abs(x) returns x.__abs__().
NumPy ndarray class and pandas Series class both define the magic __abs__() method.
abs function
That's why abs is not allowed to take unsigned parameter.
If your vector is real and has zero average as in your example, you can take advantage of the fact that the two halves of the DFT are complex-conjugate (from basic signal processing) and save half the abs computations.
So using this ABS implementaion on the most negative value leads to undefined behaviour.
From [cppreference on std::abs(std::complex) (hyper-link)]:
The norm calculated by this function is also known as field norm or absolute square.
The Euclidean norm of a complex number is provided by std::abs, which is more costly to compute.
In some situations, it may be replaced by std::norm, for example, if abs(z1) > abs(z2) then norm(z1) > norm(z2).
std::hypot(x, y) is equivalent to std::abs(std::complex<double>(x,y))
The main reason is that abs handles underflow and overflow during intermediate computations.
So, if norm under/overflows, your formula returns an incorrect/inaccurate result, while abs will return the correct one (so, for example, if your input numbers are in the range of 10200, then the result should be around 10200 as well.
Another reason is that abs may give a little bit more precise result.
abs(), if I remember correctly, is in the script named - builtin.py which in Python is called a Module.
So abs() is a function.
abs is a built-in function, as specified when you run help:
As should Math.abs(slideNum) * -1.
The reverse of abs is Math.abs(num) * -1.
If you don't feel like using Math.Abs * -1 you can you this simple if statement :P
Math.abs will likely work for you but if it doesn't this little
No need to write a function, use Math.abs() multiply by -1 or use the bitwise operator.
The error is because abs is a built-in function but in your code, it is not returning any value.
You need to change abs to abs(n).
Abs returns the type it is given, so you have to either select E[i], use an operation such as sum, or just have for i in E.
For example:
Assuming you want the 2-norm of abs(E-e*sin(E)-M[i]) to be greater than 10^-4, you'd write:
All of those operations in the abs() work elementwise in numpy arrays, so you're doing some things that end with an array, taking the absolute value of every element in that array, then comparing to 10**(-4) and ending up with an array of booleans.
if you wanted to do dynamic operator lookups on that module you don't have to special-case abs().
You might wanna use operator.abs with functions like itertools.accumulate, just like you use operator.add for +.
If abs(random()) returned the value of max(id), then the modulo's result would be zero.
Since abs(random()) can return any value between 0 & 9223372036854775807, this is definitely possible.
There are values in your target variable which have an absolute value < 1.
If you want to use MAPE as an evaluation metric and are uncomfortable with the way that LightGBM is using rounding to calculate it in this setting, I recommend altering your target variable to ensure that all the values are > 1 in absolute value.
We cannot implement abs as |a| because unary_ works only with !, ~, + and -
This means your code can be shortened to abs(X)./sum(abs(X)).
This is a tricky and somewhat tedious issue with C and C++ partially fixed by the corred std::abs() added more recently.
If you're on a Unix system try man 3 abs.
Your use of the (unqualified) abs() is equivalent to ::abs() and it gets int abs(int) from stdlib.h.
Above I wrote std::fabs() when I meant std::abs().
fabs() is what we always had to use to avoid the very issue of a cast to int seen here.
The abs() function is declared in <stdlib.h> which you've not included.
The abs() function is defined inside the <stdlib.h>
this clause absL((X,Y),[],Result) :- Result.
Get rid of the class attribute in your xml and use YOUR fragment's name for the name attribute, not ABS.
In terms of raw execution speed, Abs(BooleanValue) appears to be an order of magnitude faster than IIf(BooleanValue = True, 1, 0).
But that necessarily means that the min absolute difference is 0 and we do not have to look any further.
ABS() will always returns a positive result where as multiplying by -1 will do as math laws says: it will change the symbol of the number.
If you are working with finance then you would use multiply by -1, but if you are just ensuring positive values you use ABS()
The answer is really simple: the code compiles because under C++11 your iostream lib includes other libraries that have exit() and abs() defined.
Actually that Abs table will call this:
To add some explanation to the code posted by ChaosPandion, the problem with F# functions like abs is that they can work with any numeric type.
In addition to this, the implementation of abs uses two additional tricks that are allowed only in the F# library - it specifies different code (to be used when inlining) for different types (using when ^a:int = ....) and a fallback case, which uses Abs member, so it will work with any explicitly listed type or a type with Abs member.
The fact that the expression is inside an abs call doesn't change the way that it's interpreted:
Second, maximizing absolute value is not a convex problem!
You have to be very careful when using the overloads of std::abs as some standard library implementations litter the overloads across many files, some of which get implicitly included into others, like <iostream>.
If you #include <cmath> or #include <cstdlib> (the second one from C++17) before your std::abs(0.5f) then the float overload will be available.
Reference: [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/fabs (hyper-link)]
One of which is the abs() function.
The abs() function return the absolute value of an integer, by that we mean it will always convert it to a positive number.
Now all of this described also applies to the functions you posted about, they have a set algorithm that they do which somebody else wrote, and you just give it the argument, and catch the return type and it will do what it says it intended to do i.e abs() gives you the absolute value, pow() returns the square of some base and so on
(df.CCC-aValue).abs() will take the absolute value of the df.CCC-aValue, and argsort will sort the values and takes the sorted indexes, and df.loc will show the rows with sorted indexes
With abs flipping negative values, and the subtraction shift values around, it's hard to visualize what's going on.
How about putting ABS before you convert it to varchar?
If you need the value as a string and positive, then do the conversion after abs:
That's because numpy.ndarray implements the __abs__(self) method.
Just provide it for your own class, and abs() will magically work.
abs function looks for __abs__ method.
you can also, like numpy, implement the __abs__ method in your classes so abs would works with them.
abs works on values which define an __abs__ method, such as numbers or numpy.arrays:
lists do not define this method, although you can use map or list comprehensions (map(abs, [1, -1]) and [abs(x) for x in [1,-1]] respectively) for what you required.
If you like overkill, you can also subclass list and define a numpy-like __abs__ (but the comprehension is generally preferable)
math:abs is not built in to XSLT or XPATH.
abs() is trivial enough.
Here is a single XPath expression implementing the abs() function:
This evaluates to abs($x).
the wanted, correct result (abs() on every number) is produced:
You want abs() as an argument to sum():
For example, you can take all values in one group as positive (ABS) and sum them (SUM).
The three overloads of abs that you have from <cmath> are abs(float), abs(double) and abs(long double); it's ambiguous because you have an int argument and the compiler doesn't know which floating-point type to convert to.
abs(int) is defined in <cstdlib>, so #include <cstdlib> will resolve your problem.
and use abs without std::.
If you use C++ compiler then you should change abs to std::abs.
For me, #include <cstdlib> didn't solve the issue, maybe because I didn't have to include anything to use abs.
Because of that jsoup can't know from which URL this HTML codes comes from, so it can't create absolute path.
This way Document will know from which URL it came, so it will be able to create absolute paths.
Here, abs is again not quite perfect because it could return a real number, but as these are a subset of the complex plane returning Complex is not wrong.
Other examples are more abstract types, e.g.
To adress the question in the title: it is a bit disputed whether it was a good idea to put abs in Num.
also vectors an instance of the other num-classes, but not of Absolute.C.
Even though np.abs(data[:,:,:3] - 255) should behave like 255 - data[:,:,:3] (because f(x) = abs(x-255) equals f(x) = 255 -x for domain in range [0, 255]), the datatype makes this conversion incorrect.
The abs will always be positive, so just multiply by -1
To avoid clashes with unintentionally imported C standard library headers, use std::abs instead.
Otherwise use fabs from the C standard library.
Prior to C++17 abs for [floating points (hyper-link)] and for [integrals (hyper-link)] were defined in different headers (cmath and cstdlib respectively).
I think what Dart does is:
var x = (-1)*5.abs();
You can use var x = (-5).abs(); to get 5
With standard fabs, the bitwise AND operation is performed directly on this register (Intel syntax):
Why is the standard “abs” function faster than mine?
The GCC compiler has even a [builtin (hyper-link)] for abs
The function always return the absolute value of the first element, no matter how much elements you have in your array.
Your variable name sum implies that we should have the sum of something, but it contains an absolute value.
numpy.abs() is slower than abs() because it also handles Numpy arrays: it contains additional code that provides this flexibility.
(PS: '[abs(x) for x in a]' is slower in Python 2.7 than the better map(abs, a), which is about 30 % faster—which is still much slower than NumPy.)
Thus, numpy.abs() does not take much more time for 1000 elements than for 1 single float!
built in abs calls numpy's implementation via __abs__, see [Why built-in functions like abs works on numpy array?
Your proposed function signature n.Abs() would mean that a new array of the same size as n's would have to be allocated for this operation.
To allow this, the Abs function takes a pointer to an existing big.Rat which might be n itself.
This might not make the nicest API for all use cases, in fact if you just want to do a quick calculation for a few large numbers, on a computer with Gigabytes of RAM, you might have preferred the n.Abs() version, but if you do numerically expensive computations with a lot of large numbers, you must be able to control your memory.
Surprisingly, the abs function is defined in <stdlib.h> rather than <math.h>.
abs is not defined in <math.h>.
It can be found in <stdlib.h> and it is also defined as std::abs in <cmath>.
The C standard already defined (the global scope) [int ::abs(int) (hyper-link)] to take an int and return an int, and this is defined in stdlib.h.
The float version, [double ::fabs(double) (hyper-link)] is defined in math.h, which is the one you need to use.
C++ has overloads, so std::abs has [double std::abs(double) (hyper-link)] and [int std::abs(int) (hyper-link)] overloads.
So you could just use the C++ header, cmath, and use std::abs (or std::fabs to prevent conversions) instead.
The converter class must extend  AbstractDozerCustomConverter.
In this case check if the value toValues[idx] - previousValues[idx] is of a type that is allowed by abs() as an argument.
The same function is defined more than once
abs() is a massively overloaded function.
For example inclusion of math.h and cmath.h will result in a duplicate abs() function which will lead to ambiguity.
then "ABS" could be:
or ABS before summing
I have created the following statement:
"IIF("+Col1+ "-" + Col2 + "< 0, ("+Col1 + "-" + Col2+")*-1,"+ Col1 + "-" + Col2+")"); // ABS Workaround
Using mathjax, you can use the "pipe" symbol |to indicate absolute values.
Another way to write absolute value is 
\lvert -3 \rvert
Because back before C++ with C you used to have use abs, fabs, labs for each different type, c++ allows overloading of abs, in this case it doesn't understand or isn't happy with your overload.
Use labs(a-b) seeing as you're using longs, this should solve your problem.
You are including <cmath> and thus using the "[floating-point abs (hyper-link)]".
The "[integer abs (hyper-link)]" is declared in <cstdlib>.
As pointed out by gx_, <cmath> has a floating-point abs and on my compiler it actually compiles, but the result is probably not the one you expected:
As you can see, there is no unsigned overload of this function, because computing an absolute value of something which is of type unsigned makes no sense.
ABS is a mathematical function, that means is designed to work with numeric values, you cannot expect a proper behavior of the function when using other data types like in this case VARCHAR, I suggest first to do the required CAST to a numeric data type before applying the ABS function as follows:
This does not solve how it is posible that ABS works fine when selecting and not when updating a value, maybe it is a bug on sqlserver but also it is a really bad practice to avoid casting to proper data types required by functions.
Meanwhile, SELECT ABS('  -29972.95') produces expected results.
[ABS() (hyper-link)] is supposed to operate on numeric values and varchar input is converted to float.
This seems more a "feature" of the CONVERT function than anything to do with SELECT or UPDATE (only reason it is different is because the UPDATE implicitly converts the FLOAT(8) returned by ABS(...) back into VARCHAR).
This proves the UPDATE was using CONVERT(VARCHAR, ABS(...)) effectively with the default style of "0".
This limited the FLOAT from the ABS to 6 digits.
The ABS function in this case is returning a FLOAT(8) in the example.
The UPDATE then caused an implicit conversion that was effectively `CONVERT(VARCHAR(2048), ABS(...), 0), which then overflowed the max digits of the default style.
What does 5 have to do with absolute value?
Anyways, to replicate the abs function:
I don't understand the ABS on track... what's the intention of it?
This sum takes into account all the absolute differences between A[i] and A[m] where m > i.
If you look at the number of times each A[i] will appear in the sum of absolute differences,
Looks like abs is really twice as fast.
for abs:
You can use the definition of Abs for a complex number to get a solution in this case:
Maybe the reason that solve refuses to deal with complex arguments for Abs is for this reason: unless you know it's real or imaginary, you aren't going to get an explicit solution.
abs(x) returns the absolute value of a number.
Each value from the numbers list is passed to abs function which is added to newnum list only if abs function returns true.
Since abs returns a positive number, filter takes it as true and adds that number to newnum.
Except, in the case when that number is 0. abs returns 0 which is false and thus is not added to the newnum list.
filter returns the elements from numbers list which results in true when passed to abs function, not the returned value from the abs function.
It's not possible to have the tabs slide when you are using NAVIGATION_MODE_TABS.
That way the tabs are a part of the activity layout, and will slide.
The downside is that the tabs won't get embedded in the action bar on larger devices or when a device is in landscape.
I was having similar issue with keras cannot import abs.
You can use m.abs2 instead, It takes into account the issue with the derivative and should solve the issue.
There are various functions to get around this problem in the logical functions section of the documentation, including m.abs2, m.abs3, and m.if2.
mpz objects provide __abs__, and so the ordinary abs works:
Error in if (abs(x - oldx) < ftol) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
C++98: In 26.5/Table 80 and 81 we learn that abs is in <cstdlib> and NOT <cmath>.
which then lists abs as having additional overloads in <cmath> where the preceeding table said it should not be.
This is actually fixed in C++11 where 26.8/Table 119 clearly shows abs as a member of <cmath> as well as in <cstdlib> (although the added overloads for floating point types still appear exclusive to <cmath>.
The easiest way is to put the Abs around the whole formula:
The thing you have to remember is that strMeasCol & "2-" & strLowLimCol & "2 is creating a formula using two addresses, such as G2-K2 - so you can't start the ABS part way through that (i.e.
you were putting the ABS( between the G and the 2 in my sample address, giving something like GABS(2-K2).
We just need to find which element in current row minusing 0.5 is the smallest(absolute value).
And then we take absolute value of that, as we don't care if the difference is negative or positive.
=Iferror(ABS(A2-B2),0)+iferror(ABS(A2-C2),0)+iferror(ABS(A2-D2),0)+iferror(ABS(A2-E2),0)+iferror(ABS(A2-F2),0)+iferror(ABS(A2-G2),0)+iferror(ABS(A2-H2),0)+iferror(ABS(A2-I2),0)
SUMPRODUCT evaluates like an array formula, so you can avoid typing each ABS individually.
abs() is pointless here, that value will never be negative because the type disallows it.
You can just cast the result to a signed datatype for abs to know which one you're calling like this:
abs in <stdlib.h>(since c++11): [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/abs/ (hyper-link)]
Also works with ABS.
Abs is one of those functions that are just used to often.
So to sum up: abs is used often because it calculates the difference of two integers.
fabs how ever is not something you will need much unless you are doing math specific stuff.
Since 2147483648 is greater than INT_MAX on your implementation, then abs(-2147483648) is undefined.
This is code in abs.c in GNU glibc source code.
So,abs(-2147483648) return -(-2147483648) .
So abs(-2147483648) (hex is 0x80000000 ) --> -(-2147483648) --> 0-(-2147483648)   becomes (0x80000000) finally.
The standard says about abs():
The abs, labs, and llabs functions compute the absolute value of an integer j.
So, what's unacceptable is calling abs(INT_MIN) on your platform.
So the turtle.Vec2D object has its own __abs__ implementation, but a generic tuple has no such implementation.
You can make abs() work for any type by implementing __abs__().
In the case of turtle, __abs__() returns (self[0]**2 + self[1]**2)**0.5 as per the turtle source code [here (hyper-link)].
Vec2D class does inherit from python's tuple but abs() functionality is overridden.
Euclidean distance is calculated when abs() is called on a Vec2D.
Using 'if abs(pos()) < 1:' ...
(Maybe there's a way to draw images at other locations using 'if abs(pos()) < 1:' but I haven't figured out how.)
abs() is the absolute value function in C. It makes sure your array index is not negative.
Therefore the entries' absolute value has to be taken when they are used as indices into the array.
So since array entries become negative in the course of running the algorithm, the absolute value has to be taken to obtain valid indices.
In your case, the algorithm "sets the flag" by negating the value, "tests for flag" by checking if the value is negative, and "removes the flag" by using the absolute value (hence the abs function).
Your condition is if(abs(a[i][j])>max), so it looks like you're comparing the magnitude.
According to [abs, abs_diff man (hyper-link)]:
abs returns |x|.
abs_diff returns |x-y| without modulo overflow.
abs(-4-3) = abs(-7) = 7
abs(-4, 3) = abs(-4 - 3) = abs(-7) = 7
I believe what you are seeing is the overhead of dispatching into the numba code (rather than necessarily the speed of the compiled abs function) since the work being done in the function is so trivial.
You will have to use a combination of the sum and abs aggregate functions in SQL.
Since you want the absolute value of the sum, the sum function will need to be called inside the call to abs:
So if you need the matching line and the following one, you do grep -A1 ABS file.txt, and similarly for the preceding line with -B1.
Thus, your pattern matches strings like appabsX,abs.
abs should be fabs.
You cannot convert the max(abs(...)) and use that for the lookup; that only works for positive numbers.
You would be better off with a slightly more advanced sub-formula that can retrieve the absolute maximum than using an array formula to achieve the same.
In other words, if you cannot find the max(abs(...)) then look for the -max(abs(...)).
FIrst, you would need to match everything till .ABS, for that you can use a dot(.)
And then to match .ABS, you would need \\.ABS.
Of course, if you just want to match string that ends with .ABS, then String.endsWith would be a better choice.
If you just want to find every String that ends with ABS, then do
Unfortunately, in the newer versions of ABS, the ForceOverflow option has been removed, so in order to use this option, you will have to download an ActionBarSherlock version <= 4.1.0.
According to [Operator precedence (hyper-link)] and [Dart Language Specification (hyper-link)]-123.11.abs() is the same as -((123.11).abs()).
There are a variety of issues in mixing signed and unsigned values in calculations, so the question would be: What are most users going to do with the result of calling abs(int)?
The absolute value of that is outside the range of an integer.
When you call std::abs with such a type, the compiler has to choose one of the following overloads:
Further source that "mod" on real numbers doesn't make sense: [http://www.abstractmath.org/MM/MMNumberTheory.htm (hyper-link)]
since this brings into the global namespace the definitions of the function overloads std::abs() (they are declared & defined in cmath which appears to be #included directly or indirectly into iostream), which then clash with your own definitions.
Precense of using namespace std; causes a conflict with ::std::abs function.
abs is a function from C standard library therefore you should not use this name for your own functions.
Wherever in the code you're doing abs(somevar) you need to cast a string to an integer by doing abs(int(somevar)).
abs()
Return the absolute value of a number.
The error raised suggest you are passing a str argument to the abs() method where as it expects the choice of above mentioned arguments.
Solution would be to explicitly pass an integer object to the abs method.
The default implementation of abs() only accepts numbers.
In order to make abs() for for expressions, you have to include the mmxnlp module.
You're probably calling one of the [integral overloads (hyper-link)] of abs, defined in <stdlib.h> or <cstdlib>, so your argument is being truncated.
With this flag, clang generates what is probably optimal code for your abs function:
This uses a new function (defined using lambda) which takes a key of the dictionary and returns the absolute value of the value at that key.
This means that the result will be sorted by the absolute values that are stored in the dictionary.
The function is called Abs in sympy.
What you get back from parse_expr is an arbitrary function that just happens to be called abs:
File names returned by [filepath.Glob() (hyper-link)] are already absolute (but read below).
The returned file names are only absolute if the glob pattern is absolute.
So the easiest way is to make the glob pattern absolute.
For the expression that you provided, you would instead use ABS(FARM_FINGERPRINT('12345')).
abs() is for integers only.
For floating point, use fabs() (or one of the fabs() line with the correct precision for whatever a actually is)
You have to use:   abs() for int  fabs() for double  fabsf() for float Above function will also work but you can also try something like this.
Use float fabsf (float n) for float values.
Use double fabs (double n) for double values.
Use long double fabsl(long double) for long double values.
Use abs(int) for int values.
After following these steps, you should be able to use fabs(a) for floats instead of fabsf(a), which was used only for C99 or less!
(Even C++ 98 could allow you to use fabs instead of fabsf :P)
dt =  a*min(dx)./abs(v)
The function cannot be implemented in full by abs(x) * sign(y) because of how it's supposed to handle NaN values.
You base your justifications on how abs() and sign() are often seen together.
There's an abs(int) and fabs(double) and fabsf(float) and fabsl(long) but no mention of sign.
abs(-3+4j) return 5.0.
That's a clear example of how abs() can be used in places where sign() makes no sense.
Suppose sign(x) were added to Python, as a complement to abs(x).
If  'x' is an instance of a user-defined class which implements the __abs__(self) method then abs(x) will call x.__abs__().
In order to work correctly, to handle abs(x) in the same way then Python will have to gain a sign(x) slot.
