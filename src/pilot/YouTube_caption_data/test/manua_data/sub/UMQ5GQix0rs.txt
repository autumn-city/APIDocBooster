>> So how is Windows
Subsystem for Linux
different than a virtual
machine or dual-booting?
Dual-booting is the traditional way
to use Linux for development and
Windows for your productivity
tools, but it's a pain.
You need to boot
both operating systems and
struggle with flipping back
and forth between them.
Windows Subsystem for Linux
eliminates the need to dual-boot.
It is a Linux operating system
running right alongside
a Windows operating system,
totally integrated with one another.
Both operating systems
share the same hard drive,
they can access each other's files.
WSL also works better than
a virtual machine because
of this integration.
Using WSL with a Linux distro like
Ubuntu enables integrated features
like copy and paste using
the clipboard where you can
just copy something from
your Linux file system and paste in
your Windows file
system and vice versa.
You can open a Linux command line,
just enter Explorer.exe
and then a period and
pop open your current Linux directory
right in the Windows File Explorer,
look through your files,
whether it's on Linux or just
click another drive and
you'll be in Windows.
You can also build web apps with
Linux tools on something
like Ubuntu and then
debugging it with VS Code on
the Windows side and see it
running in your Edge browser.
Basically WSL let's use a
real Linux command line while
maintaining access to your
favorite Windows tools
whether that's VS Code,
Edge browser, Word, Outlook,
Teams, whatever floats your boat.
WSL is a great way to
have the best of Linux
and Windows all in one.
