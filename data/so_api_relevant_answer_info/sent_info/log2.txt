:-) There's no log2(x) because you can do log(x, 2).
That said, log2 was considered in [Issue3366 (hyper-link)] (scroll down to the last 3 messages) which added several other C99 math functions to the math module for Python 2.7 and 3.2.
Edit: log2 was reconsidered in [Issue11888 (hyper-link)] and added in Python 3.3.
For anyone else arriving this late, Python 3.3 and later has math.log2.
You should look at the original code on the site I linked for the context, particularly what happens with Log2(0).
log2(0) -> 0 because of use of DWORDS, in real it should be -inf
Here is the fastest implementation of log2(int) for C#:
Here are some benchmarks:  (code here: [https://github.com/SunsetQuest/Fast-Integer-Log2 (hyper-link)])
There have been quite a few answers providing fast approximate approaches to log2(int) but few for log2(float), so here's two (Java implementation given) that use both a lookup table and mantissa/bit hacking:
Log2 has the following signature (see: [here (hyper-link)]) :
Cast as real before you apply log2 (or before you divide, if you don't want integer division).
Prototype: double log2(double anumber);
   Header File: math.h (C) or cmath (C++)
log2() is only defined in the C99 standard, not the C90 standard.
Microsoft Visual C++ is not fully C99 compliant (heck, there isn't a single fully C99 compliant compiler in existence, I believe -- not even GCC fully supports it), so it's not required to provide log2().
If you're trying to find the log2 of strictly integers, some bitwise can't hurt:
With Visual Studio 2013, log2() was added.
log2(x) = log(x) * log(e)
math.h defines M_LOG2E to the value of log(e) if you define _USE_MATH_DEFINES before inclusion of math.h:
Also, in case if you have compilation issues with log2 for Android, seems like log2 is available in headers starting from android-18:
You probably have a script that is called log2.m in your running directory, which prevents octave from calling its own log2 function.
I assume that is the case because D:\All_Data\my_data\backup3\backup3\tech\DSP\log2.m
doesn't look like a path where standard octave library functions would be installed.
Looks like Android doesn't support log2 function by default.
Intrinsic functions are really fast, but still are insufficient for a truly cross-platform, compiler-independent implementation of log2.
As with any other computational method, log2 requires the input value to be greater than zero.
The IEEE float format stores the exponent in bits 30-23 as an integer with bias 127, so by shifting it 23 bits to the right and subtracting the bias, we get log2(x).
The function 'mylog2' does some simple log trickery to get a related number which is between 1 and 2, then call log2_aux with that number.
The log2_aux more or less follows the algorithm that Scorpi0 linked to above.
The idea is, say you want to find log2(13), you can know that it lies between 3 to 4.
Also 3 = log2(8) and 4 = log2(16),
Now, sqrt(8*16) = 11.3137 and log2(11.3137) = 3.5.
Since 11.3137<13, we know that our desired log2(13) would lie between 3.5 and 4 and we proceed to locate that.
It is easy to notice that this has a Binary Search solution and we iterate up to a point when our value converges to the value whose log2() we wish to find.
According to the [OpenCL documentation (hyper-link)], T log2 (T) is defined, so log2(double) returns a double which should only give you a compiler warning when implicitly casted to int.
to avoid any compiler warning and if this still does not work, use my [evil fast log2 method (hyper-link)]
[log2() (hyper-link)] takes a float/double number as a parameter, thus you are probably losing precision during the implicit casting.
If you want the correct answer up to about 2^53, then for largish numbers you can do some integer division, so that log2 can stay operating in its comfortable range.
log(df[,2:length(df)],2) works but sapply(df[,2:length(df)],log2) might work better if you've a big dataframe.
C++11 added [std::log2 (hyper-link)] into <cmath>.
The GCC report at [Issue 79017: Old PowerMac G5, MacPorts GCC 5.4, C++11 and "std::log2 has not been declared" (hyper-link)] got some good comments from the GCC devs.
I'm not entirely sure what you're asking but log2 gives you the logarithm base 2 in R. For example
In mathematics, the binary logarithm (log2  n) is the power to which the number 2 must be raised to obtain the value n. That is, for any real number x,
     x = log2 ⁡n ⟺ 2x = n.
So, in your code, n & -n first turns off all bits other than the rightmost bit that was originally set to 1, then it takes the log2 of that resulting number to get its power-of-2 (which happens to be the same value as the 0-based position of the bit that was set to 1), and finally adds 1 to that result to get a 1-based bit position (which is weird since bits are typically referred to by their 0-based positions instead).
So, 5 & -5 = 1, then log2(1) = 0, and 0 + 1 = 1.
So 1041204192 & -1041204192 = 32, then log2(32) = 5, and 5 + 1 = 6.
So 0 & -0 = 0, and log2(0) is -INFINITY which is undefined for integers.
So (-1) & -(-1) = 1, then log2(1) = 0, and 0 + 1 = 1.
So (-2) & -(-2) = 2, then log2(2) = 1, and 1 + 1 = 2.
If you have an efficient clz ("count leading zeroes") then a log2 implementation might look like this:
(Note: returns -1 for ilog2(0).)
A further bonus of using clz rather than ctz is that you get floor(log2(x)) for non-power-of-2 values, making your ilog2 function more generally useful than if you had used ctz, which only works for exact powers-of-2.
(1) no full specializations are allowed inside a struct/class; so your can't full specialize log2 inside log2arr.
You can migrate log2 outside log2arr or, if you really want maintain it inside log2arr, you can transform the full specialization in an equivalent partial specialization (legal inside a struct/class); by example, as follows
(2) if you return a int * from getArr(), you loose the information regarding the array inside log2Arr class; so doesn't work the range based for loop (for(auto i : a.getArr())).
(3) you can't manage the arr array (not static member of log2Arr) inside a method of the embedded structure log2
and (in log2<1>)
(5) with log2<I> that initialize arr[I] and log<1> that initialize nothing, your int arr[N] contains arr[0] and arr[1] values that are not inizialized.
By simply counting the leading zero bits in a fixed-point number x, one can determine log2(x) to the closest strictly smaller integer.
A typical approach for computation of log2(x) is to use x = 2i * (1+f) and use approximation of log2(1+f) for (1+f) in [√½, √2], which means that we use a polynomial p(f) on the primary approximation interval [√½-1, √2-1].
Edited by Eloff, this code seems to give the right answer with log2(n+1) steps as you predicted:
I run two examples, one with the requested log2() function and the second one with exp().
The usual strategy is based on the identity log(a*b) = log(a) + log(b), or in this case log2( 2^exponent * mantissa) ) = log2( 2^exponent ) + log2(mantissa).
Or simplifying, exponent + log2(mantissa).
The mantissa has a very limited range, 1.0 to 2.0, so a polynomial for log2(mantissa) only has to fit over that very limited range.
If it's important that your function evaluates log2(1.0) to exactly 0.0, you can arrange for that to happen by actually using mantissa-1.0 as your polynomial, and no constant coefficient.
It already just does log2 instead of log, unlike VCL's where the log-base-e is baked in to the constants and how it uses them.
This is what I meant by log base e being baked-in: you'd need a coefficient on those terms, or to get rid of that line and re-fit the polynomial coefficients for log2.
However, if you need more L1 cache for the other needs, you can decrease the amount of cache used by logarithm algorithm by reducing cnLog2TblBits to e.g.
And then changing the tail of Log2TblPlus() after line const __m256d t = _mm256_div_pd(tNum, tDen);:
It's likely that if cnLog2TblBits==5, you won't need anything beyond terms012.
I would create a function called trans_log2 that would automatically do this, e.g.
all in all, our solution  to the value substitution would be (abs(x))^(sign(x)) and then we can happily log2, so we get:
Log2Transformed <- log2((abs(df))^(sign(df)))
log2(x) is the inverse of 2**x (2 to the power of x).
If you have a column of data that has been transformed by log2(x), all you have to do is perform the inverse operation:
Do not try to run log2 (or other numeric computations) on a data.frame as a whole, instead you need to do it per column.
lapply(mydf[,isnum], log2) runs the function log2 against each column of the sub-frame, each column individually; what is passed to log2 is a vector of numbers, not a data.frame as in your attempt
log2 x = log10 x / log10 2
Simple binary search: log2(n) comparisons
There are programs that work symbolically - they remember that a is log2(n) and when you do 2**a, the exact value of a is returned.
The parser does not automatically match "log2" in the given string to the function you created.
You have to tell it explicitly that's what is to be done, with local_dict={"log2": log2}.
In the uniform case, P(x[i]) is (by definition) 1/N for any possible x[i], we have H(X) = -N * (1/N log2(1/N)) = -log2(1/N) = log2(N).
This is obviously a bad encoding given the expectation, there are only 26 letters and they're equally probable but we're using more than log2(26) ≈ 4.7 bits on average, the average would be (1 + 25 * 6)/26 ≈ 5.8.
if your search algorithm is based on compare, and the list is ordered, the log2(n) is the lower bound.
Depending on the compiler used to build numpy np.log2(x) is either computed by the C library or as 1.442695040888963407359924681001892137*np.log(x) See [this (hyper-link)] link.
Instead add 0.5 to log2 and typecast (not sure if e-language supports it) to integer.
log2(x) is the same as log2 x.
This calls the function log2.
The clever coder then uses that binary representation and scales the value so that you get log2 of the input value.
As mentioned in the comment log2 ,log10 aren't in the S3 Math generic.
In fact, exp, expm1, log, log10, log2 and log1p are S4 generic and are members of the Math group generic.
What appears to be happening is that NextMethod is not stripping the lame class, so when log2 calls log, it re-dispatches to the lame method, which now no longer works, because it's calling log2 with base = 2L, a parameter log2 doesn't have.
The Math.log2(x) function can be computed as Math.log(x) / Math.LN2;.
The .log2() function is a newcomer to the Math constructor, and not supported by all browsers.
I'm actually not certain you'll hit a number like 1.99999999 because your log2 should not lose any accuracy when calculating 2^n values (Since floating point rounds to the nearest power of 2).
If you just want a fast integer log2 operation, the following function mylog2() will do it without having to worry about floating-point accuracy:
It turns out that this is exactly the same as log2().
By subtracting 1 from the result, you get floor(log2(x)), which is an exact representation of log2(x) when x is a power of 2.
First, call log2:
When you are computing the values that should be substituted when values in a are non-positive, log2 is called and applied to a.
To suppress this error, you could replace non-positive values with 1 first, and perform log2.
However, I don't know if it is possible to do log2.
An alternative is to use ggplot2 with scale_x_continuous with trans = "log2", and then ggplotly
So $t0 = 2n where n = log2($t0), which also means that $t0 = 2log2($t0)
We are thus interested in finding the largest integer z such that 2z <= 2log2($t0)
So we can simplify what we're looking for to the largest integer z such that z <= log2($t0), which is the definition of floor(log2($t0)).
So big-O for log2(n^n) would be O(n*log2(n))
8Log2(n)
= (23)Log2(n) (because 8 = 23)
Log2(n) (using Prop#3)
= 2Log2(n3) (using Prop#2)
Log2(nn)
Log2(n) (using Prop#2)
a complexity of log2(n)/5 is the same thing as O(log(n)).
However, for a real win you should be better than O(log2 log2 (n))?
As you correctly note, log2(5**x) == x * log2(5).
log2(5) is a constant, which can be approximated to 2.3219281.
for a simple, efficient and mathematically elegant way...  floor(x*log2(5))
For
f(x) = floor(x*log2(5)) = floor(x*some_float_c) the value of some_float_c is bounded by 100 minimum and maximums below.
log2 is declared double log2(double); it takes a double argument and produces a double result.
When log2(ULLONG_MAX) is evaluated, ULLONG_MAX is converted to double.
Then log2 applied to 264 produces 64.
[log2() (hyper-link)] receives a double, but long and long long in your platform have 64 bits of precision, which is far more than double can store, as it's probably [IEEE-754 binary64 (hyper-link)] and has only 53 significant bits.
The closest to ULLONG_MAX in double is ULLONG_MAX + 1.0 = 264 and obviously log2(ULLONG_MAX) = log2(264) = 64.
If you want to get the base 2 logarithm of such numbers then you'll need a type with more precision like long double on some platforms, and also a good log2 library (see below for why that matters).
But also notice that even in long double we get log2l(18446744073709551615.0L) = 64!!!
The result on Godbolt above is for glibc and you need to find some better log2 library as I said above.
As commented by chux below, the result might be faithfully rounded in this case but unfortunately the closest long double value to log218446744073709551615 = [63.999999999999999999921791345121706111... (hyper-link)] is 64.0L
If you just want to [get the position of the highest 1 bit (hyper-link)] then never use log2()!!!
In older C++ versions you can use [boost::multiprecision::msb(x) (hyper-link)], [boost::static_log2(x) (hyper-link)].
[Fast computing of log2 for 64-bit integers (hyper-link)]
Why do I get wrong results with log2(ULONG_MAX) and log2(ULLONG_MAX)?
ULLONG_MAX or 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 or 264-1 converts to 18,446,744,073,709,551,616.0 before being when passed to double log2(double).
The result is 64.0 which is math correct for log2(264)
I tried log2l-function.
With [80-bit "double extended" extended precision format (hyper-link)] with its 64-bit precision, ULLONG_MAX coverts to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615.0L when passed to long double log2l(long double).
To get a log2(ULLONG_MAX) to produce a good result less than 64 (which (int) truncates to 63), the floating point encoding needs:
We need to show that, for every constant c, there exists n such that 2^(2^ceil(log2(n))) > c * 2^n.
2^(2^ceil(log2(n))) < 2^(2^(log2(n)+1)) = 2^(2n)
You can find more information here: [std::log2 (hyper-link)]
(Computes (ceil(log2(this < 0 ?
[log2 docs (hyper-link)]
You'll get to know that variable d is a datatype set to double, again if you do the same thing with log2l(), you'll find that d is set to long double, i.e.
the function log2l() returns a long double, but the value is rounding down while typecasting implicitly from a long double into int.
That's why, it'll show 58 for log2().
And in contrary, 57 for log2l() when the variable is an integer.
So to get from log2(n) to log3(n) you need to multiply it by 1 / log(3) 2.
In other words log2(n) = log3(n) / log3(2).
log3(2) is a constant and O(cn) = O(n), thus O (log2(n)) = O (log3(n))
To understand why Log2(n) is O(log3(n)) you need to understand two things.
the difference between log2 (N) and log10(N) will be a simple ratio, easily calculated if you want it as per luk32's answer.
Basic math manipulation would give us csr_matrix.log1p(PPMI) / csr_matrix.log1p(2) to be equivalent to np.log2(PPMI)
log2 is a C99 function.
So the error tells you that log2() was not defined in your code that leads to some issue in the code you didn't post.
a.c:(.text+0x11): undefined reference to `log2'
  collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
a.c: In function ‘partSize’:
  a.c:5:5: warning: implicit declaration of function ‘log2’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
Your version of math.h doesn't define log2
So for example, you can describe log2/pow2 as shown here:
Finally, you can prove the following theorem relating log2 and pow2
In the first piece of code, the compiler replaces log2(16) with the constant 4.
There is no call to log2.
As you can see there is a call log2 in this version.
So the problem happens only when I pass val to log2 (as shown in code).
is NOT passing the variable val to the function: log2()
(I assume this is a simplified MCVE, as you would never actually need to compute log2(1) at runtime.)
Here are some benchmarks: (code here: [https://github.com/SunsetQuest/Fast-Integer-Log2 (hyper-link)])
Update 3/13/2020: [Steve noticed (hyper-link)] that there were some errors in Log2_SunsetQuest3 that were missed.
In .NET Core 3.0 there are [BitOperations.LeadingZeroCount() (hyper-link)] and [BitOperations.Log2 (hyper-link)].
Part of your confusion seems to be treating Log2(n) as Log2 * n. Log2 is actually a function, the inverse of which is 2^x.
10^(log10(2^32) + 10^-15) - 2^32 == 9.8895 * 10^-6, but 2^(log2(2^32) + 10^-15) - 2^32 == 2.977  * 10^-6 and 100^(log100(2^32) + 10^-15) - 2^32 == 0.00001977, also log2(INT_MAX) > log10(INT_MAX) It means that with larger logarithm base, if logarithm function tries to "search" for a proper result, it'll sooner hit situation where modifying predicted result is no longer possible due to rounding off errors.
log2: 105s
Correspondingly, the other implementations are: [log2 (hyper-link)], [log10 (hyper-link)].
Before calling log or log2 the argument is converted using
I also doubt that GCC would do that for log10 but not for log and log2.
So the answer to “why it converts to 31” is that log2((unsigned)~0) is between 31 and 32, as you can expect knowing that ~(unsigned)0 is slightly less than 232.
log2 is not included in C90.
Since N is a vector log2(N) also returns a vector so you are trying to multiply two vectors.
*): y1Values = N.*log2(N);
[std::log2 (hyper-link)] was introduced in C++11.
gcc4.8 or later, compile with -std=c++11), and use std::log2 inside your function.
If you don't use std::log2, then the compiler cannot find the standard function (as you are not using namespace std;) and tries to use yours, which of course is not defined for doubles, and you get an error.
As far as I know, the built-in function log2 is not declared in namespace std.
You should use the following code to call the standard log2 function:
grep '^log2.read.counts.2289_Tail'
Assuming you don't have a list of files already:
ls -1 | grep "log2.read.counts.2289_[0-9]{1,}_Tail"
And if I compile your Log2 with -O3, I get a ~740 byte function for that, so it is in the same ballpark.
It works by representing the number as a power of 2 and trial-multiplying it by coefficients that happen to have log2 values equal to a binary fraction (2^-n).
Multiplying by such coefficients is equivalent to adding together the logarithms, and thus the FRAC_LOG2 macro expands to a sum with elements selected with nested ternary expressions.
It seems that module overlays the base numpy ufuncs for sqrt, log, log2, logn, log10, power, arccos, arcsin, and arctanh.
Instead of overriding sys.stdout, you could override the print function, like eg print = lambda x: open('log2.log', 'a').write(str(x)+"\n")

will not log prints recursively
enables per file logging
Remember that log2(x) = ln(x)/ln(2).
We can rewrite that as ln(x) = c log2(x) with c = ln(2).
I would agree with N^2*log2(N) as the sort algorithm is run N times.
It will be asymptotically O((N^2)*(log2(N))
You need numpy.log2 function to aplly, please, check sintaxis [here (hyper-link)].
This is strictly not related to Qt and happens only because those functions are not defined in Android, as discussed in [Does Android support log2 (hyper-link)] and [Android ndk can't find atof function (hyper-link)], among other places.
Looks like your numpy install is grabbing its log/log2 implementation from two different places which is odd.
Computers use base 2 - According to the articles linked in reference, the computation of log2 is a 4 processor cycles process - that of log10 requires to multiply log2(val) by 1/log2(10) which adds another 5 cycles.
Finding log2 is a matter of [finding the index of the least significant bit of a value (hyper-link)].
By the relationship
  log10(v) = log2(v) / log2(10), we need to multiply it by 1/log2(10),
  which is approximately 1233/4096, or 1233 followed by a right shift of
  12.
Of note: the use of DeBruijn sequences lookup & bit shifting techniques to calculate log2 in this [MIT video: Lec 2 | MIT 6.172 Performance Engineering of Software Systems, Fall 2010 (hyper-link)] (video at the 36th minute mark onward).
Of note this StackOverflow post which demonstrates [a method to make efficient log2 calculations truly cross platform with C++ (hyper-link)]
I'm almost certain that any implementation of log to the base e function can be made as fast as the log2 function, because to convert one to the other you require a single division by a constant.
In the comments, some people observe same speeds for np.log and np.log2; I suspect this may come from different builds / platforms.
You can find the nicely commented source code for the two functions in files e_log.c, e_log2.c, e_logf.c, e_log2f.c in the dbl-64/ and flt-32/ subdirectories of [this GitHub repo (hyper-link)].
For double precision, in glibc, the log function is implementing a completely different algo (compared to log2) from IBM from ~2001, which was included in their libultim library.
Whereas log2 is from Sun Microsystems from ~1993.
In contrast, for single precision, both functions log and log2 are the same apart from division by ln2 in the log2 case, hence the same speed.
Actually log2 can be directly executed over a numerical data frame, so you can try the code below
Then, set the values in those columns by looping through the index specified in 'j1', subset the columns from 'dt1', divide and take the log2.
I guess you could create a script which runs log1 and log2 in the background, and then pipe that to program.py
One approach would be to create an additional variable, re-scaling log2:
Then make a note of what the equivalent log2_scale values are for log2 values that you want to colour by.
Then replace the vector in the values argument with the log2_scale values that you have chosen (these should be between 0 and 1).
To automate the calculation of the values vector, you could create a custom function that uses the clean_file data.frame and maps the original log2 values to the scaled values.
If your simulator supports IEEE 1364-2005 or any IEEE 1800 then use $clog2.
Thus the second loop has a complexity of log2(log2(n)), which grows slower asymptoticially than the first loop.
If you are asked about the complexity of the whole code, it is dominated by the first loop, so it is log2(n).
The video you're referring to asks only about the second loop, which is log2(log2(n)).
For a basic 2 way merge sort, the number of moves is n ⌈log2(n)⌉, but the number of compares varies depending on the data, but time complexity will be O(n log(n)) with variation in the constant.
What is going on with log2 is that "Severity" is present twice in the string, so the result of split is a three-elements array.
As we know log2(x)=ln(x)/log(2)
We can apply in APML as AMPL supports natural logrithm.
And since log2(1)==0, You can use this and rewrite your entropy function as
n ⌈log2 n⌉ − 2⌈log2 n⌉ + 1
Of course n ⌈log2 n⌉ = ⌈n log2 n⌉ and 2⌈log2 n⌉ ≥ n so for n ≥ 1 this confirms answer (a) as an upper bound.
If you write ⌈log2 n⌉ = log2 n + d for some 0 ≤ d < 1 then you get
n (log2 n + d) − 2d n + 1 = n (log2 n + d − 2d) + 1 = (n log2 n) + n (d − 2d + 1/n)
and if you write m := ⌈log2 n⌉ and n = 2m − d that last parenthesis becomes (d − 2d + 2d − m).
leafs has to have a depth of at least ⌈log2 n!⌉.
log1.addHandler(logging.handlers.FileHandler(fileName1)
log2.addHandler(logging.handlers.FileHandler(fileName1)
The log1 and log2 files under the <profile_root>/tranlog directory record information required for transaction recovery.
Take it simple, think that the extern while loop is executed sqrt(n) times and that inside there is another while loop that is executed log2(n) times and inside it assume that all operations take O(1) time to being executed.
So we have a while loop executed sqrt(n) times and an operation inside it that take O(log2(n)) to being executed (that is the other while loop, think of it as a black box pf which you know the asymptotic running time).
Therefore the complexity of the algorithm is O(sqrt(n)log2(n)).
This version already includes log2 and other math functions in the standard libm platform, so there were not problems during compilation or executing in devices/emulators using this version of Android.
log2(n) = log2(2m)
log2(n) = m

Put another way: Performing a binary search on an array of size n = 2m takes time proportional to m, or equivalently, proportional to log2(n).
The log2 function would need to be constexpr for this to work (which it isn't).
Then you'd use it as log2<13>::value, which would result in 3.
Finding the def of log2 was the key !
Then you discovered the signature - definition for log2(...){...;}
Now the question becomes what type or types does log2() accept or expect; and what type(s) do(es) vicQAlloc->GetAllocate() return(s)?
as f(n) < c*log2(n) (for large n) only implies
It first takes log2 of the exponent directly (trivial to do), then uses an approximation formula for log2 of the mantissa.
It then adds these two log2 components to give the final result.
The first part of your code separates E and M. The line commented (1) computes log2(M) by using a polynomial approximation.
filter(log2==min(log2)) does not give you lowest absolute min, it will return the row with minimum value within each group.
It still doesn't explain why log2 just magically decided to use complex numbers though.
double logBase2 = Math.Log2(number);
double logBase2 = Math.Round(Math.Log2(number), 2);//2 digits after the commas
Therefore, the number of bits required to store a number N is log2(N), but since there is no half bit, you need to round it up to the cloest integer above.
where log2 means log base 2.
So, the effect from the first row of summary(h) is 0.36212 = (log2(0.211)-log2(0.001))*.0469.
You shouldn't need apply(), as log2() is vectorized.
This way, you can pass log1, log2, log3 (any number of logs you like and get back a list of tables for each
If you happen to have more that one variable to ignore you can add them in array except(['log2', 'log3','log4'])
for log1 and log2 location you can mention in job.properties
How does taking the log2 determine how many digits are needed to represent the data?
If you understood the working principle, you understand the use of the log2.
Computing the log2 of a number retrives the necessary number of digits for a binary encoding of this number.
Example: [log2(10)]=[3.32]=4, 4 digits are needed for binary encode 10.
log2 = ... is equivalent to this.log2 = ... in absence of var log2, and nothing changes this in the case of log1, so they both assign a function to a property of the global this.
y = 12510 (0x30DE), log2 = 13, divisor = 26, x = 481,1538
divisor = (float)(1 << log2); with log2 = 13 yields 8192.
log2 << 1 would result in 26.
Just for fun, I changed the line into divisor = (float)(log2 << 1); and got the following output:
Built-in transformations include "asn", "atanh", "boxcox",
  "exp", "identity", "log", "log10", "log1p", "log2", "logit",
  "probability", "probit", "reciprocal", "reverse" and "sqrt".
trans should be a transformation object (like the return value of a call to scales::log2_trans) or the name of built-in transformation, so we can also use trans = scales::log2_trans() instead of trans = 'log2'.
The next step is to aggregate on the category, summing up ni log2 ni for all categories.
And furthermore, since the addend is also zero for ni = 1, since log2(1) = 0, we can excise every category that has less than 2 constituents.
EDIT: added syntactic sugar suggested by mat and added two predicates which fixes problems when using the newly defined log2 in combination with other mathematical operators
As it was correctly said, extern __m128 _mm_log2_ps(__m128 v1) is [SVML routine (hyper-link)], so
the very first solution I see is to use [Intel Compiler (hyper-link)].
Find number of bit for subnets: For 10 subnets, one requires ceil(log2(10)) = 4 bits
Find number of bits for hosts: For 3110 hosts, one requires ceil(log2(3110)) = 12 bits, and it works since 2**12 = 4096 > 3110 + 2
Applying [Stirling's approximation (hyper-link)] to the log2(n!)
n log2(n) - log2(e)*n + O(log2(n))
which is Ω(n log2(n))
The associativity has no direct effect on the index size (only the size of the sets of cache lines matters for index size), and the problem you're having is probably related to indexSize = log2(assocNum); (which doesn't make sense).
To describe this restriction in terms of a "block size", we need to know the number of bits in N, which is simply log2(N).
Quicksort is O(n log2(n)) under ideal cases, and it's more like O(n log1.4(n)) (~ 30%/70% average split).
For example, events with the tag log1 will be sent to the pipeline1 and events with the tag log2 will be sent to the pipeline2.
The point is that, if the output of every guess carries exactly one bit of information (like 'lower' and 'greater or equal'), then you will have to guess ceil(log2(n)) times in worst case to know for sure which number is the guessed number.
The minimum number of guesses: i = log2(F(i) + 1), so F_inv(i) = ceil(log2(i + 1)) = floor(log2(i)) + 1 for every positive integer i
The error in your program is that you are missing a parenthesis in your log2.close.
Change it to log2.close(); and it will run!
because using promise with then makes your task asynchronous and it's placed in the event queue to be executed later, so the console.log("log2: " + imgUrl); is executed before the imgUrl = url;
Its output is then piped to awk to compute the log2 of the numbers of each line and produce tab-delimited results.
There seem to be a few SSE log2 implementations around, e.g.
There is also the [Intel Approximate Maths Library (hyper-link)] which has a log2 function among others - it's old (2000) but it's SSE2 and it should still work reasonably well.
[Using your own log2 function from a library (hyper-link)] (this is what I do.)
Thus log<sub>2</sub>(n) displays log2(n).
I mean the number 2 in this expression: log2 n
so this would be applicable for log2.
Your initial assumption that the Big O is 1 + 5*(log2(n) + 1) + 1 is close but not quite there.
Ex: log2(n) = log10(n) / log10(2).
This is what you are looking for based on this equation:function N = 10 * (Log2 N)^2+1000
Suffice to say you have essentially written log2 x = 0 if ...... One might expect the second phrase to be a definition or part of the same expression as the 0, but if begins neither.
log2 x = until (\y -> x == 2^y) (\y -> y + 1) 0
In terms of big-Oh notation, log3(n) is equivalent to log2(n).
[Ogre::Math::Log2 (hyper-link)] returns a Real which is actually a float and you are trying to store it as an int.
So in this example it would be added to the log2 table
n0.01, squareroot(n), 6n log n, 2n log2 n, 4n3/2, 4logn, n 2 logn
Actually, the problem that could prevent log2(8) to be 3 does not exist for basic operations (including *).
But it exists for the log2 function.
log2 is not part of the basic operations.
So without more hypotheses on the log2 function that you use, it is impossible to tell what log2(8.0) can be.
However, most implementations of reasonable quality for elementary functions such as log2 guarantee that the result of the implementation is within 1 [ULP (hyper-link)] of the mathematical result.
So about log2(8), the answer is “if you have a reasonable quality implementation of log2, you can expect the result to be 3.0`”.
The other way around, a binary tree with n elements has a height of log2(n+1) - 1.
If you want an exact answer, then it is clearly not N log(N) or N log2(N).
For most integers N, logN and log2 are not rational, but the number of comparisons must be an integer value.
It takes log2 n to find each one, and it needs to be done n times, so n log n it is.
There will be at most (2 * log2n + 1) rounded down(so 7.6 => 7) comparisons for 1 number.
To find the number, we must process at most log2n numbers.
So looking for 16 in [1..16] will take 2*log216 + 1 = 9 comparisons (assuming we land on these numbers: 8, 12, 14, 15, 16).
And looking for 10 in [1..10] will take 2*log210 + 1 = 7.6 => 7 (Assuming we land on these numbers: 5, 8, 9, 10).
Furthermore, load is initiating a service request (whose details you haven't shared with us), but based upon the behavior you describe (namely, not see "log2"), I'm guessing that this service request is scheduled to run on the same thread as load.
Among the log terms, log2 n is the largest and there are n-1 terms.
The sum is therefore less than (n-1)log2 n, this is in O(n log n).
The above list would be -
1) 5000log2(n)
2) n^(1/100)
3)sqrt(n)+7
4)n/log2(n)
5)8n
6)4nlog2(n)
7)1/4n^2-10000n
n/log2(n) should be between sqrt(n) + 7 and 8n.
To answer your question "what is the proper way to express n*log2(n)" - use n.*log2(n);
The logs from the first thread are in folder1 > log1 and logs from the second thread are in folder2 > log2
If you have N elements, the minimum height of a binary tree will be log2(N)+1.
and if log1 and log2 must be frozen before, make a copy of the dicts
In this case, when using scale_x_continuous(trans=log2_trans()) or scale_y_continuous(trans=log2_trans()), the regression analysis is done after the scale and data transformations, but when using coord_trans(x="log2", y="log2") the regression analysis is performed on the untransformed data first and then plotted to the transformed coordinates.
My modified code now results in the correct value for y-intercept (3.21) and a negative slope (in accordance with negative correlation) for log2-log2 plot.
Expression Math.log(number) / Math.log(2) is equivalent to Math.log2(number)
You can create a Math.log2 function if it doesn't exist:
This will produce 3 files names log1.log, log2.log and log3.log with the content 1 2 and 3 respectively.
log2Ceil() is a good function to find size of a word.
log2Ceil() calculation is done once at synthesize time, it's not an hardware function.
I think the usage is log1( value, 'log_topic'); and then log2(value, 'log-topic1', 'log-topic2')
[…] struggling to come up with something with time complexity O(log2(N)).
So you are trying to find the differences between the log2's of each of the other numerical variables from the log2 of the Average, you can do something like.
Then, for each X.-column and ProbeSetID, calculate ratio and take log2, i.e.
log2(X.bla/mean):
The following code seems faster than ilog2_str on Firfeox 89, Chrome 90.
Note also that the solution run in O(log2 n) time, because we're just calling "push-up" and "push-down" which run in that order.
One other thing: removing an arbitrary node is indeed a log2(n) operation.
If you analyze it by Big O Notation it is still O(N^2) but if you'r trying to find its average complexity it may be  ~2log2(N) and AFAIK it is a bit difficult to find an algorithm's average complexity.
(Note: height <= log2(leaf nodes) is only the case for balanced trees.
If what you want is to create a new table log2 with the values from log plus the dense rank as basescorethe query should look like this:
Your formula p = 69 + 12 * log2(f / 440) is for converting a frequency in Hz to a musical note (the [MIDI (hyper-link)] note number).
On deletion, it is possible that a rotation is needed on every level of the tree, so deletion is O(log2(d))
Therefore, taking the log2 of the smallest of the rows and columns will theoretically give you the total number of possible octaves... as you have noticed in the above code.
In our case, either the rows and columns are the minimum value, and taking the log2 of either the rows or columns gives us 7 octaves theoretically (log2(64) = 7).
H = - Sum(p(i) * log2(p(i)))
log2(16)) with a literal value (e.g.
Yes, you need log2(vector_width) shuffles and vpaddd instructions.
EDIT: But if the only thing you have truly is 2^n (and you cannot turn your logic around), you can still avoid the expensive (and double/float) call to log2:
Here is the updated code but now the log2 formula shows as 0.0 for any number entered.
Thus, the height of the tree is at least d = 1 + log2(n-1)
So the tree that has n at the root cannot attain height log2(n) if it has more than 2 elements.
Remaining 16 elements comprise a perfect binary tree of height 4, so total tree depth is 5, which contradicts the claim that the depth can't be ceil(log2(17)) == 5.
m = log2(M).
M = 16MB (16,777,216 bytes), then m would be 24, which is log2(16,777,216).
As you can see we start with the little m due to the processor constraints, but you could always decide you want a memory space of size M, and use that to select a processor that can handle it based on word-size = log2(M).
log2(x) ("logarithm base 2 of x") is the inverse function of 2^x.
That is, log2(2^x) = x for all x.
You need log2(M) bits to represent M different numbers.
Note that if you start with M=2^m and take log2 of both sides, you get log2(M)=m.
So at the end, I'd say d-10 = d-2 * log2 / log10 is almost right.
If one method synchronizes on another object, then the two methods aren't mutually exclusive anymore, and one thread can call log2 while another thread calls log1.
So you can't call in a single thread the methods log1 and log2 at the same time?
To be precise, you can't call the methods log1 and log2 in different threads at the same time.
In this case, two separate threads could execute log1 and log2 simultaneously because they synchronize on different objects: log1 on the MyClass.class object, and log2 on the log object (wherever that is defined).
So you can't call in a single thread the methods log1 and log2 at the same time?
It means that if the first thread acquire MyClass.class lock (it can dot it by calling log1 or log2) then the second thread, if he wants to execute anything locked by MyClass.class (in your case any of the methods log1 or log2), must wait until first thread releases this lock to execute.
If you use a trigger, be aware that as it seems both Log1 and Log2 use identity columns, that you can't use SELECT @@IDENTITY to return the PK of Log1 - you will need to use SCOPE_IDENTITY().
From lowest to highest, what is the
  correct order of the complexities
  O(n2), O(log2 n), O(1), O(2n), O(n!
),
  O(n log2 n)?
That is log2(2k).
For the greater than log2(maxsize) case, [the specification (hyper-link)] says what happens to those levels in Raterization/Texturing/Texture Completeness.
O(logn) = O(log2n) = O(log10n) ...
