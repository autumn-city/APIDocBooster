JumpTwiice: what are we writing
f6ary: gehotz is prob more successful than majority of Harvard grads
graftom: @jumptwiice wondering the same
case0x00: I guess the goal of this is to get tinygrad on a custom ASIC akin to TF on a non-edge TPU
haris_pap: Would you guys say that learning computer architecture is a good start for someone to be able to understand what George is coding right now ?
Denis0109: Harvard is an illusion people, wake up

smurfd0: is it because 32768 (32x32x32) is bigger than a signed short, where as 16x16x16 is still in that signed short?
Siggis_Man: hi @georgehotz
ItsAMarcos: no one can tell you what to do because if they could and it were worth it, they would have hired someone

IccyCold: If we don't gift a sub, can we still ask questions?
IccyCold: Oh fuck... that was a question...
Warbayx: @IccyCold ofc not
ItsAMarcos: ask him if he would rather install vscode or github desktop
N3RdR4Ge92: pay 2 win :(

ElGreko17: gottem
Marin_031: @cPPcod1r My sister too Kreygasm
bottonresult: js is good for functional programming too
hardwallz: SO what? I mean, you could straight up compile python to machine code if you want.That would make it pretty fast
BigCryptoCat: well Haskell says fuck you all
mrbaggiebug: that song was so fire my whole house burnt down, now im homeless
Marin_031: Only 25% people passed Haskell on my uni, for some reason we have it at first year

Marin_031: @MauriceChavez I proved MergeSort recently it took me a whole fucking while to do it
darkzade: @hardwallz bcs pyhton already is, that how you execute python. the thing about high level languages is that they are not explicit in terms of memory
ace50: @MauriceChavez looked at google images... omfg awful
MauriceChavez: @macrovest good job if u understand what u wrote.
Mayfieldiv: maybe `min(SZ, M) - m`
MauriceChavez: @Marin_031 good job if u understand what u wrote

yep_cog: i wish i had enough brain cells to understand what youre coding
karanberries: What's the problem george
hardwallz: @darkzade What if you go py -> Nuitka -> gcc? That would make the memory pretty explicit.
Osaroki: @itsfrancee the answers you find on google are personal opinions
BigCryptoCat: @Santiago_LHC alias vim=nano LUL
Haemly: @itsfrancee what do u even do with that information though
Marin_031: @MauriceChavez It's all about going backwards the right way
PhoonReborn: @yep_cog you do, you just lack experience
f6ary: nah nano is trash
ace50: @Osaroki personal opinions? lul
TheGhostface007: nano is only good for small files
darkzade: @hardwallz explain why that isnt done in every python program then
cubernetes: @itsfrancee really depends on what you're coding
Marin_031: For a proof you need another theorem and that theorem needs another theorem for a proof
Mayfieldiv: didn't it work with SZ=4 though?
Marin_031: Untill you get to trivial theorem
Osaroki: okay stop taking all the space over a stupid question
Marin_031: Then you just do it with simple tactics
bottonresult: theres no trivial theorem, its called an axiom and its not a truth from nature, its arbitrary
ace50: stop hating each other :D
hardwallz: @darkzade Don't know. It might be something I am missing. Would like to understand thou. I personally don't see why python _needs_ to be slow.
ItsAMarcos: hot tub stream when?
Marin_031: @bottonresult By trivial in coq I mean the ones that require only built in theorems and axioms that you can apply or rewrite to solve the goal
smurfd0: is this what you look for? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5344843/a-loopless-3d-matrix-multiplication-in-python
MauriceChavez: @Marin_031 is it possible to prove 1 == 1 in coq or is it just an axiom
bottonresult: @Marin_031 I'm sorry , I thougt you was talking about pure maths
f6ary: who cares if 1 == 1 lol
architectzs: That is not the HHKB I‚Äôm sorry I have to say it lol
Mayfieldiv: -k % min(SZ, K)
Marin_031: @MauriceChavez it's 1 = 1 and it's reflexivity
crakeenn: i love watch how u code even when idk what are you doing
Marin_031: @bottonresult Nah, pure math uses classical logic, coq uses contructor logic
