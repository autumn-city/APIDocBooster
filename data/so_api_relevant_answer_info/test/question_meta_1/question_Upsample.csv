,Inference time of tiny-yolo-v3 on GPU,<tensorflow><deep-learning><gpu><yolo><darknet>,"I am doing inference of tiny-yolo-v3 on google collab using GPU runtime.
GPU used was Tesla P100-PCIE-16GB. 
After running the darknet inference command , The predicted time shown was 0.91 seconds.
I could see from code that this time stamp is the processing time of the network on GPU which excludes pre and post processing of image.
I have created cells which contains the same results.
Now, I am little confused regarding this . I know these GPUs are very costly and gives good performance. But 0.91 seconds inference time accounts to performance of 0.9 frames/second , which is not significant.
Can anyone tell me whether I am doing something wrong here?
Or It is the actual performance of GPUs?
I know inference time depends on lot of parameters like network size etc, but how fast GPUs can process data in terms of Frames/second in networks like tiny-yolo-v3?

,Oversampling after splitting the dataset - Text classification,<python><scikit-learn><vectorization><logistic-regression><text-classification>,"I am having some issues with the steps to follow for over-sampling a dataset.
What I have done is the following:
[code snippet]
Since my dataset looks like:
[code snippet]
I applied a vectorizer to transform string into numbers:
[code snippet]
Then I applied the logistic regression function:
[code snippet]
However, I have got the following error at this step:
[code snippet]
ValueError: X has 3021 features per sample; expecting 5542
Since it was told me that I should apply the oversampling after splitting my dataset into train e test, I have not vectorised the test set.
My doubts are then the following:
is it right to consider later a vectorisation of the test set: X_test_up = pd.DataFrame(vectorizer.fit_transform(X_test_up['Text'].replace(np.NaN, """")).todense(), index=X_test_up.index)
is it right to consider the over-sampling after splitting the dataset into training and test?
Alternatively, I tried with Smote function. The code below works, but I would prefer to consider also the oversampling, if possible, rather than SMOTE.

Any comments and suggestions will be appreciated.

,Video upsampling with C/C++,<c++><c><video-capture><video-processing>,"I want to upsample an array of captured (from webcam) OpenCV images or corresponding float arrays (Pixel values don't need to be discrete integer). Unfortunately the upsampling ratio is not always integer, so I cannot figure myself how to do it with simple linear interpolation.
Is there an easier way or a library to do this?

,Upsampling: insert extra values between each consecutive elements of a vector,<c++><oversampling>,"Suppose we a have a vector V consisting of 20 floating point numbers. Is it possible to insert values between each pair of these floating points such that vector V becomes a vector of exactly 50 numbers.
The inserted value should be a random number between upper and lower value I've decided to insert a midpoint of two values between the two.
I have try the following:
[code snippet]
with this function the input vector elements increases by 2(n) - 1 (20 elements becomes 39). It can be possible that the input vector has different sizes less than 50.
I think it can be done by inserting more than one value between two elements randomly to have a vector of size 50 (e.g. between V[0] and V[1] insert 3 values, between V[3] and V[4] insert 1 value, etc.). Is this possible?
Could you please guide me how to perform this?
Thank you.

,"pandas >= 0.18 - changes to resample, how to upsample with groupby",<python><pandas><time-series>,"I was using a piece of code similar to the block of dummy code shown below to insert NaN values based on attribute IDs for missing days (i.e. days where there is no data for that particular attribute ID) in a timeseries data set.
