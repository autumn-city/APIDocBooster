in the name of god my name is hardy from
iran this research is about using
reinforcement learning in dynamic
pricing problem by considering customer
behavior and advertising about the
problem of outline we have a multi-armed
bandit problem as you can see the
population is present at the
first of the each period and after some
interaction into the system the customer
can decide to buy if the system will
stay in the system for the next period
this will be repeat from t equal to one
until t equal to n if i want to speak
about
the system first of all the solar
proposed the pli
uh the respect to unknown initial
distribution and by aiming to maximize
his revenue after that the customer
observed the price and based on the
accepted value of the product and by
comparing to current price and the
expected price and based on the some
terms that we call
impatient of the customer and we share
with the delta decide to buy leave the
system or
stay in the system and after that the
seller observe the buyer's
decision and
update his belief and consequently
update the price of the
product by aiming to maximize his income
we have some assumption
uh some
uh most important is the inventory is
until limited the customer are divided
into myopic and forward-looking the
myopic and forward-looking customer have
the same willingness to pay expect that
the forward-looking customer can
postpone his portion
and the population is a present at the
beginning of the each period you have
some valuables
uh the pr is the per solar price
solar price on the arm of the eye
delta is a customer patient which is the
the terms that divide the cost so much
into myopic and forward looking and it
is between zero to one
uh we have a
demand for myopic and forward-looking
customer
um
about the equation
first off of the customer decide based
on this equation in this equation mu i
is a willingness to pay a is
advertising which is decreased uh during
the time the guitar is a
customer patient and peer assuming the
prediction of the price you can cut
probability of the uh pressure based on
this equation
uh and if i
want to
have
uh two boundary terms and i can see when
the delta is a zero which means the
customer is polymoryop
uh the demand for forward-looking
customer is equal to the demand of the
myopic bond and if the delta is equal to
one which means the
customer is fully forward looking we can
calculate the demand on the uh some
condition
we developed a transfer sampling model
based on the bernoulli and normal demand
in the
bernoulli edema
uh we obtained the sample
tertiary eye from the distribution of
beta and after that we choose ioi
by aiming arguments
this terms and finally
we choose a bernoulli sample by
success probability of r and if the
result
is equal to 1 we add to reward on the
other hand we add to the f
in the same way we develop
this algorithm for the normal
distribution you can see
the steps it's
like the bernoulli distribution in the
nominal result
first of all we can see that by
increasing the delta which means by
uh
going from the myopic customer to full
one looking customer the sellers
have to propose
less price
and you can see the same pattern in the
normal distribution and normal demand
about the income
you can see
if we
use the
developed option sampling in the
presence of the strategic
customer
we earn more uh this is for the
bernoulli demand and you can
see
in the same for the normal demand but in
the normal dividend difference is less
than the uh bernoulli
we propose some suggestions uh if we
face with a myopic customer we should uh
identify the acceptance value of the
uh
or volume really needs to pay off the
product for the customer and
price based on input and when we look
the forward-looking customer
uh we can use dynamic pricing and
change the price during the
periods
by aiming to maximize
our revenue
