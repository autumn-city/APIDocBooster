 So where onCreate is called when the activity is first created, onPause it's going to be called when you leave the activity. 
whenever a new ACTIVITY starts the previous activity's onPause will be defiantly called in any circumstances. 
onPause is guaranteed to be called on Activity A (No matter whether Activity B is non-full-sized transparent or full-sized). 
onPause() is always called on your Activity if it is in the foreground when Android wants to do something else.  It may start another Activity which may result in your Activity's onStop() getting called. It may just call onResume() on your activity. It may just kill your process without calling any more of your lifecycle methods.
Since onStop() is not guaranteed to be called, you can't always do in onStop() what is done in onPause().
