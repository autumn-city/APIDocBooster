Then we will go on here again, it will receive receive the  hidden state and the cell state from the previous time step, the current time step input, output something and so forth. So that's how the LSTM cell class works."
Then we have an LSTM cell that takes in the previous hidden state and the new observation and action and spits out a new hidden state.
LSTMCell is an object (which happens to be a layer too) used by the LSTM layer that contains the calculation logic for one step.
LSTM is a recurrent layer.
 An LSTM layer is a RNN layer using an LSTMCell, as you can check out in the [source code (hyper-link)].
Basically you want to use one LSTMCell for each layer, and you should be careful on how to go from input to output, layer by layer taking into account the hidden states.
