hey everyone and welcome to pie torch
deep learning and artificial
intelligence
now this is one of the most exciting
courses i've ever made
i've been making these deep learning
courses for a long time before pytorch
was even invented
so it's been quite a journey for me to
see how this field has evolved in the
past few years
and guys it's been moving quick the best
practices and guidelines you'll learn in
this course are the latest and greatest
this stuff did not even exist when some
of my previous deep learning courses
came out
things like the best way to train your
neural network to architecture decisions
thanks to the hard work of deep learning
researchers all around the world
i've been able to take what they've
learned and bring that information to
you
this course is designed to be a beginner
to advanced course
so you don't need a lot of math and
background knowledge but of course
if you're into that sort of thing i
certainly have resources for you
we're going to start by looking at basic
machine learning in the form of a neuron
the fundamental building block of neural
networks
from there we are going to jump right
into neural networks the thing that
started it all
luckily with pytorch you don't need a
lot of heavy theory
unless you want it the pi torch api
already implements a set of composable
building blocks
so you can focus on building cool things
rather than debugging and mathematical
equations
next we're going to look at
convolutional neural networks which are
specialized neural networks
for computer vision then we'll look at
recurrent neural networks
which are specialized neural networks
for sequence data such as time series
text speech and dna we'll even apply
rnns to stock prediction
this is one of my favorite exercises
from this course because it teaches you
what
ninety percent of other people are doing
wrong if you've ever used an lstm for
stock prediction before
or taken a class that promised to teach
you you'll definitely want to watch this
because pytorch has a modern and easy to
use interface
it makes building extremely complex
things much easier than they used to be
here are some example applications
first we have gans which stands for
generative adversarial networks
these are a new training paradigm which
allow you to use deep learning to
generate
beautiful photorealistic images what's
absolutely crazy about this is that
the images you are looking at now are
people that do not actually exist
but it doesn't stop there deep learning
has been applied in the field of
reinforcement learning
which excels at tasks that take multiple
steps to complete
like playing a video game deep
reinforcement learning agents have beat
world champions in the strategy game go
and in modern video games such as cs go
and dota 2.
these are things we wouldn't have
dreamed of just 10 years ago
of course if that's not enough we still
have more deep learning powers
state-of-the-art natural language
processing applications such as
speech recognition and machine
translation
so whenever you talk to your phone and
it figures out that you want to say
order a pizza or send an alarm tomorrow
for 6 a.m
that's speech recognition using deep
learning in action
neural machine translation has
significantly enhanced the capabilities
of language translation
in the recent years with students in 200
countries around the world i've made use
of this great technology more than once
and guys i could go on there's
self-driving vehicles
object detection facial recognition deep
fakes
synthesizing speech so you can have a
phone conversation with a robot
so if you want to learn how to use the
world's fastest rising deep learning
library
this course is for you thanks for
listening and i'll see you in the next
