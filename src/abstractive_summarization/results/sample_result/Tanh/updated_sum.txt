[Updated API Documentation]:
This API is <Tanh> from the PyTorch library.

Function: The <Tanh> API applies the Hyperbolic Tangent function element-wise, according to the defined algorithm [function]. This results in an expected output of transformed data, adhering to the state transitions of the Hyperbolic Tangent function. Exceptions may arise if the data type is incompatible with the function.

Parameter: This API accepts any number of dimensions (âˆ—) as input, and the output mirrors the same shape. Be aware of the valid range of your incoming data and ensure the right format to avoid errors due to invalid arguments. Also, the return values will inherit the data types of the original input.

Notes: OS and hardware dependencies haven't been explicitly documented yet. Respect security constraints while implementing APIs and also pay attention to potential variances in different environments. No existing external references or specifications are present for this API. However, be aware of potential performance impacts based on the size and type of your input data. This API is not subjected to any legal issues but beware of misuse. For more specific or detailed issues, consider resources like Stack Overflow or GitHub.
