Then we will go on here again, it will receive receive the  hidden state and the cell state from the previous time step, the current time step input, output something and so forth. So that's how the LSTM cell class works."
Then we have an LSTM cell that takes in the previous hidden state and the new observation and action and spits out a new hidden state.
So in basic sense, these are generally comprised of bi-directional LSTM cells or bi-directional. So generally we have the X as the input features and we have the hidden state from the previous timestamp of the previous cell.
An LSTM cell consists of three gates-- the input, forget, and output, as well as a cell state.
The cell state is like a conveyor belt.
