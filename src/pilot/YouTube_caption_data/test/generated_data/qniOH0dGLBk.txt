foreign
my
machine learning and artificial
intelligence okay so our
then
okay thank you uh
uh then obviously please
object
okay
then follow peace
[Music]
okay
okay please
okay
then
is
[Music]
foreign
um
um
please
okay thank you then
okay then uh
please
have hey i'm peter i worried
please
[Music]
[Music]
there
[Music]
hello
[Music]
foreign
[Music]
thank you
department
okay
uh
is
foreign
that means another full course of the
target which is a data science sheet and
data science
machine learning
term actor
subscribers
details
full course data scientific okay data
science and machine learning a boom data
science implement journal machine
learning implement for a journal
programming language like that share
programming language such as a python
okay
so python programming language
full course total 21 classes thank you
and
per week two classes
and each every classes
every class duration will say up now uh
two hours okay approximately two hours
two hours
data science have future or not
then how much money do the data
scientists make okay so
so what
foreign
foreign
okay
um
foreign
information always process processed set
of data okay
it also data data information
information about the main differences
concept information and data it shocked
me after the
concept
okay
uh cannot data so important
data is everywhere
is
um
foreign
foreign
um
but polar portrait pattern so safe
tackle better you can say
that that's important
happening
not necessarily
foreign
foreign
foreign
data analyst not a good data scientist
data
um
okay what is data science
i'm not the random learner
what is data science
so data science
foreign
data science
[Music]
um
machine learning and deep learning okay
machine learning
statistical
fifty percent the full machine learning
complete could take a lot of statistical
machine learning about deep learning do
take a apprenticeship
for machine learning
because deep learning is the part of
machine learning
okay so deep learning
extraction feature engineering then
statistical analysis related cuts okay
after
and artificial intelligence machine
learning deep learning data analytics
natural language processing computer
vision
related
data related
machine learning deep learning
artificial intelligence data analytics
data analysis
what what is the difference between data
analysis and data analytics
analysis
data analytics
[Music]
directly to analysis
deep learning machine learning
artificial intelligence and data science
questions

okay
machine learning friendly now
but deep learning friendly now
are which is a data analysis based on
analysis friendly to the data analysis
artificial intelligence the machine
