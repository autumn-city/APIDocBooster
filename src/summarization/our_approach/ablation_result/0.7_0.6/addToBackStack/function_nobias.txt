addtoBackStack method can be used with add() and replace methods.  It serves a different purpose in Fragment API.
 When specifying a fragment transaction, you can call add to back stack to add the fragment transaction to the back stack.  Then, when the user hits the Back button, instead of your activity being finished, the fragment transaction is reversed.  Only when there are no more fragment transactions will the Back button finish your activity. 
We can see the exact difference when we use addToBackStack() together with add() or replace().  When we press back button after in case of add()... onCreateView is never called, but in case of replace(), when we press back button ... oncreateView is called every time.
You can also go back to the previous fragment in the backStack with the popBackStack() method.  For that you need to add that fragment in the stack using addToBackStack() and then commit() to reflect. This is in reverse order with the current on top.
Fragment API unlike Activity API does not come with Back Button navigation by default.  If you want to go back to the previous Fragment then the we use addToBackStack() method in Fragment.
