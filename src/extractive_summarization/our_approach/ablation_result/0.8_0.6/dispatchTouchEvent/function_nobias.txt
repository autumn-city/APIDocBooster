The dispatchTouchEvent() method of a ViewGroup uses onInterceptTouchEvent() to choose whether it should immediately handle the touch event (with onTouchEvent()) or continue notifying the dispatchTouchEvent() methods of its children. 
For ViewGroup.dispatchTouchEvent things are way more complicated.  It needs to figure out which one of its child views should get the event (by calling child.dispatchTouchEvent). This is basically a hit testing algorithm where you figure out which child view's bounding rectangle contains the touch point coordinates.
â€¢ViewGroup.onInterceptTouchEvent(MotionEvent) - This allows a   ViewGroup to watch events as they are dispatched to child Views. 
ViewGroup.dispatchTouchEvent()  onInterceptTouchEvent()  Check  if  it  should  supersede  children Passes  ACTION_CANCEL  to  active  child If it returns  true  once,  the ViewGroup consumes  all  subsequent  events  For  each  child  view  (in  reverse  order  they  were  added)       If  touch  is  relevant  (inside  view),  child.dispatchTouchEvent() If  it is not  handled  by  a previous,  dispatch  to  next  view  If  no  children  handles the  event, the listener  gets  a  chance       OnTouchListener.onTouch()  If there is no listener, or its not handled       onTouchEvent() 
But before it can dispatch the event to the appropriate child view, the parent can spy and/or intercept the event all together.
