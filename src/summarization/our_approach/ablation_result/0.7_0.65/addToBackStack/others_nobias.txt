 So you'll notice that I have this addToBackStack before I replace the content with the output fragments.  And you might think that if I move this here, now when I hit the return it would return to the output fragment.  That change isn't actually made until here when I do the commit.  So addToBackStack Input Form should do the same exact thing whether I have it before or after this replace. 
the reason why the popBackStack() and popBackStackImmediatly() is due to the fact that you didnt add that fragment (that you want to pop) to the backStack.  In order to do this you have to make a call to addToBackStack() at the moment of making the transaction to add/replace your fragment.
