Max pooling does not dilute the location of the maximum pixel - instead consider it as a way of downsizing.  Max pooling is just a way to reduce dimensionality of the problem such that your problem fits into device memory. A nice side property is that it pools the strongest acitvations from your feature map.
Maximum pooling produces the same depth as it's input.  With that in mind we can focus on a single slice (along depth) of the input conv.
Max pooling does nothing more than iterate over the input image and get the maximum over the current "subimage". 
Max pooling decreases the dimension of your data simply by taking only the maximum input from a fixed region of your convolutional layer. 
They are considering 2 horizontal, 2 vertical and 4 diagonal 1-pixel shifts.  That gives 8 in total.
