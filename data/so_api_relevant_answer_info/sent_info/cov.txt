[pytest-cov package (hyper-link)] is required if you want to pass --cov arguments to pytest, by default it should not be passed though.
Just after installing pip install pytest-cov:
In my case, I ran into the issue described here inside a virtual environment, but it turned out that pytest was defaulting to my system installation (which did not have pytest-cov installed).
Similarly you can run python -m pytest file_name.py or for coverage python -m pytest --cov=my_project tests/.
If you are trying to use cov-manage-im using the binaries provided by Coverity SCAN, please note that this tool is intentionally not available.
This has to do with how numpy.cov interprets its first argument.
You have each observation in a row, while [numpy.cov expects each observation in a column.
To fix, take the transpose of data in np.cov(data.T) to get the X x X covariance matrix:
[Octave's cov (hyper-link)] treats rows as observations and columns as variables:
[numpy.cov (hyper-link)] defaults to the opposite behavior:
Specify rowvar=False when calling numpy.cov to get the Octave behavior.
The covariance of List is what allows you to supply a List[Employee] where a List[Person] is required, however the problem is that a List[Person] is being returned which is not compatible with List[Employee].
There are additional robust covariance attributes in the result object as well.
Also, by convention, the covariance matrices for the heteroskedasticity-consistent estimators are only available after you already call the corresponding standard error, such as: you must call result.HC0_se prior to result.cov_HC0 because the first reference causes the second one to be computed and stored.
It returns the residuals, the regression variance and standard error (standard error of the residuals-squared), the asymptotic formula for large-sample variance, the OLS covariance matrix, the heteroskedasticity-consistent "robust" covariance estimate (which is the OLS covariance but weighted according to the residuals), and the "White" or "bias-corrected" heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance.
In the root of your project, create file .coveragerc containing:
Depending on your setup, you might need to add --cov-config=path/to/.coveragerc as option to the py.test command.
There are more options you can use [to configure coverage (hyper-link)].
You should add your module's name to the --cov command line option, for example form pytest-cov documentation:
This restrict the coverage to the module myproj and all its sub-modules.
coveragerc
A more convenient way is DeviceEventAdapter which ships all methods - one you need to implement is covNotificationReceived.
Once you have your listener in place you need to fire SubscribeCOVRequest for specific object you want to watch.
But the argument to --cov should be a module name, not a file name.
So instead of py.test --cov=testcov.py, you want py.test --cov=testcov.
To apply coverage you execute py.test --cov.
If you want a nice HTML report that also shows you which lines are not covered you can use py.test --cov --cov-report html.
in this case, removes unwanted files from the coverage report.
That error message tells you that a function named cov is not exported by default by PDL.
If I search the [PDL (hyper-link)] CPAN page (using the grep tool), I do not see a function named cov.
A google search yields [PDL::Stats::Basic (hyper-link)], which has a cov function.
html-cov was dropped in 3.0.0 [1]
That's because PyCharm's test plugin didn't adapt to breaking changes in coverage>=5.0 yet.
Until the issue is fixed, pin coverage to previous major:
When installing using apt-get install llvm-9, llvm-cov will be installed with a suffix of the version number as well.
process.env.EXPRESS_COV would be true when you're running tests and want to see the code coverage of those tests (i.e.
Mocha, the test framework used for express, achieves this through the use of [jscoverage (hyper-link)].
JSCoverage parses through your source code and adds a bunch of lines that look like this:
So we'd never want JSCoverage processed files in our codebase.
Fortunately, JSCoverage places the modified files in a different directory.
In this case, ./lib-cov/ instead of ./lib/.
The "cov-analyze" binary and the rest of the files for local analysis are only provided if you contact their sales team for a trial as it is not something given out for free.
In other words if you want to analyze your project you have to use their community version which requires you to upload to their [https://scan.coverity.com/ (hyper-link)] through Github or manual upload.
Edit: By reading the source I have discovered that you can also list directories as SOURCES and it will recurse into them.
When pytest is invoked from test itself, all imports are done already, and, therefore, they are not counted as covered.
To make it covered they need to be imported during pytest-cov execution.
It appears use of demangled function names is not hooked in everywhere in llvm-cov.
Either comment out X = np.transpose(X) # byrow=FALSE, or use np.cov(X, rowvar=False).
var, cov and cor compute the variance of x and the covariance or
  correlation of x and y if these are vectors.
If x and y are matrices
  then the covariances (or correlations) between the columns of x and
  the columns of y are computed.
The covariance is computed by row (X[0] returns the first row), and I suspect that R stores the data in Fortran order, whereas Python/Numpy uses C order.
You have to pass the transpose of the data matrix to numpy.cov() because numpy.cov() considers its input data matrix to have observations in each column, and variables in each row.
As you can read from the documentation of np.cov() here:
[https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.0/reference/generated/numpy.cov.html (hyper-link)]
Here in the code provided if you pass the Transposed matrix to np.cov() , you will get the same values as you are getting in R using cov().
You must use z=cov(x,bias=1) in order to normalize by N ,because var is also norm by N
(according to [this (hyper-link)]
The default ddof of cov (None) and var (0) are different.
Going by [https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html (hyper-link)], the JSON format is explained in the source code, which I found at [https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/main/llvm/tools/llvm-cov (hyper-link)].
Both your function and np.cov (by default) assume that the rows of X correspond to variables, and the columns correspond to observations.
When you run the py.test command to kick off your tests, you can simply add the pytest-cov arguments to the command.
This tells the coverage plug-in to report coverage stats specifically on that code.
You can make things a little more sophisticated by adding a [.coveragerc file (hyper-link)].
The usual coverage tools are built for the much more common case of the measured code being run inside the same process as the test runner.
You can use coverage.py directly on the remote machine when you start the process running the code under test.
The simple rule of thumb is that wherever you had been saying, "python my_prog.py", you can say, "coverage run my_prog.py".
pytest-cov uses under the hood [coverage (hyper-link)] and it has updated the local coverage file to sqlite [https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.1/changes.html#version-5-0a6-2019-07-16 (hyper-link)].
To solve the issue is as simple as remove the old .coverage file (rm .coverage) and re-run your test case.
You are using an old and no longer supported version of Coverity Prevent (4.5 or older) since you are referencing the Defect Manager.
type help cov, and note that opt has been removed doesn't exist.
By default pytest-cov will report coverage for all libraries, including external.
If you run pytest --cov against your code it will produce many lines of coverage including py, pytest, importlib, etc.
To limit the scope of the coverage, i.e.
you only want to inspect coverage for random, just pass the module names to the cov option e.g.
pytest --cov=random.
The coverage report then only considers the named modules.
You can also  pass multiple modules by specifying multiple cov values, e.g.
pytest --cov=random --cov=pytest
Here's an example running your test to produce coverage only against random
Yes, mocha's html-cov only reports on what jscoverage provides.
cov-import-scm would be run after your cov-build and before your cov-analyze command.
Depending on how you're running your commands, you might need to supply some command args to the cov-import-scm command.
Following which, I was able to run and get the coverage report.
So essentially I had to combine the individual .o files to a combined object file, which then llvm-cov was able to process.
There isn't a feature like this in coverage.py (on which pytest-cov is built).
And then if you follow the documentation that you can find [here (hyper-link)], you will be able to use the covariance function from Numpy.
A revisited test_get_ip__unhappy that covers the complete code in the gaierror case:
You can do this by specifying another --cov-report argument with one of the terminal output formats.
You can have --cov-report term or --cov-report term-missing.
See the [pytest-cov docs you linked to (hyper-link)] for how term and term-missing work.
There is a tool named [diff-cover (hyper-link)], which can check coverage for git diffs.
It takes Cobertura XML coverage reports and compares with the output of git diff.
It then reports coverage information for lines in the diff.
I cannot see whether grunt-mocha-cov is able to output Cobertura reports, but you should be able to find some grunt plugin that does.
Note that diff-cover doesn't help you to avoid unneccessary coverage instrumentation for performance reasons.
You may need to add coveragerc and use the —omit option.
For now, COV is implemented in the develop branch only.
You can subscribe to a COV for any point (if your device supports it).
By default, confirmedCOV are declared.
More information available in the documentation :
[https://bac0.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cov.html?highlight=cov (hyper-link)]
Variance is a routine basic descriptive statistic, so are covariances and correlations.
var simply coerces the input data frame to a matrix via as.matrix and then calls cov on that matrix.
In response to the question why, well I guess that the variance is closely related to the concept of covariance and to keep code simple R Core wrote a single implementation for the covariance of a matrix-like object and used this for the variance as that is the most likely thing you want from a matrix.
diag(var(df)) is unlikely to be quicker than sapply(df, var) as the former has to compute all the covariances as well as the variances.
Your actual answer has been covered by @GavinSimpson.
This way you are covered to gracefully fail a test instead of crashing a test through a raised exception for whatever reason.
It runs coverage.py using pytest:
To specify coverage for multiple folders, provide the --cov multiple times:
This is due to pytest-cov using coverage combine, which combines all coverage results: In parallel it mixes results from other runs, that may or may not be completed, and in any cases are irrelevant.
In which case it's easily solved by specifying a unique COVERAGE_FILE for each run, like:
See: [https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/883#issuecomment-650562896 (hyper-link)]
For the covariance, just subtract the respective means and multiply the vectors together (using the dot product).
(Of course, make sure whether you're using the sample covariance or population covariance estimate -- if you have "enough" data the difference will be tiny, but you should still account for it if necessary.)
For the correlation, divide the covariance by the standard deviations of both.
Why would a covariance matrix be non-symmetric?
) Are you sure you don't have a typo in your definition of cov?
It is due to presence of NAs in the matrix you get all the values as NA when you are using cov.
You can remove NAs and then use cov
This is a missing capability in llvm-cov.
The reason for this is that clang does not emit any code for unspecialized templates, and the coverage generation logic depends on clang emitting code for a function.
Edit: Of course, another point to consider is that C++ translation units tend to contain absolutely enormous amounts of unspecialized/uninstantiated templates, and if the compiler were to emit coverage mapping regions for each of these, compile-time and binary size would likely regress massively.
There wasn't any problem other than cov-build being slower than expected.
Using [Process Explorer (hyper-link)] while cov-build was running was the key diagnostic step.
It looks like the bash script codecov uses to upload coverage data to their site looks for files matching a wide range of patterns associated with formats that it understands.
Of course, this doesn't tell you what expectations codecov has about the format of files matching a given pattern, as you discovered when your coverage.json file was rejected.
Through trial and error I have found that the following produces a file that codecov will interpret correctly when you run the bash script:
llvm-cov show ./test.out -instr-profile=default.profdata > coverage.txt
I haven't extensively tested what file names are allowed, but it seems that you can put whatever additional characters you want between coverage and .txt in the name of the file that you're piping the coverage data to (e.g.
you could call it coverage_my_file_name.txt).
EDIT: Just in case this is helpful to anyone, it turns out that an important corollary to the above is that it's critical that you avoid naming anything that isn't a coverage report something that matches this pattern.
I just dealt with a scenario where I had a bunch of executables named coverage_[more_text_here].out that were getting uploaded with the reports.
It turns out that attempting to parse assembly code as a coverage report can cause codecov to mysteriously fail without any useful errors.
Another option is to use GCOV profiling, which is a little less precise than source-based, but it is supported by codecov.io.
You need the "--coverage" compiler flag to enable it.
You can use [grcov (hyper-link)] (which you can also download from [https://github.com/mozilla/grcov/releases (hyper-link)]) to parse the gcno/gcda files and upload them via the codecov.io bash uploader:
I'm planning to add support for source-based reports to grcov, which will make it easier to support the format on codecov too.
A = A-matrix(1,T,1) %*% colMeans(A)
covmat = Conj(t(A))%*%A/T
where T is number of rows will give the same output with matlab cov(A,1), thanks everyone.
Just use cov(A).
to true in this way the whole app is loaded and simplecov reads it.
Eager load the whole Rails app when running tests suite with code coverage.
Simplecov slows down tests that's why I use shell environment variable to turn it on.
Since pytest-cov plugin could pick up .coveragerc configuration, and recommended by [pytest-cov (hyper-link)]:
For further control of coverage use a coverage config file.
And do py.test --cov-config .coveragerc [other parameters].
Please see [http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/config.html (hyper-link)] for more options.
Note that you don't really explicitly add --cov-config if the coverage config is indeed of name .coveragerc (it's a default for coverage.py and pytest-cov)
And performed py.test --cov main.py, which gave me:
Name    Stmts   Miss  Cover
2) The OpenCV CalcCovarMatrix is not normalised.
covars/(values.rows-1) fixes this and produces the same output as Python Numpy.
According to Apple gcov is not a part of Xcode 7 coverage support.
Gcov was gcc legacy that stayed around till appearance of replacement.
Apparently they dropped legacy gcov file format support in favor of new intermediate format — profdata.
I did research on my own and didn't find any tools that converts profdata back to gcov, however there is [Slather from Venom (hyper-link)].
Slather is able to generate coverage reports in Gutter  JSON, Cobertura XML, HTML and plain test.
It also able to provide integration with popular service like Coveralls.
Currently it works also only with gcov, but they have issue opened and PR request pending for support of profdata.
Converting of plain text output from llvm-cov show
Help Slather guys an introduce cross-coverting from their model back into gcov, as soon as they will merge in profdata support
When a and b are 1-dimensional sequences, numpy.cov(a,b)[0][1] is equivalent to your cov(a,b).
The 2x2 array returned by np.cov(a,b) has elements equal to
(where, again, cov is the function you defined above.)
By default numpy.cov calculates the sample covariance.
To obtain the population covariance you can specify normalisation by the total N samples like this:
Note that starting in Python 3.10 [release schedule (hyper-link)], one can obtain the covariance directly from the standard library.
Using [statistics.covariance (hyper-link)] which is a measure (the number you're looking for) of the joint variability of two inputs:
This will show you the coverage of all compiled source files.
Sadly, looks like by default grunt-mocha-cov doesn't support this, as the reporter only accepts a 'string' ([per the docs (hyper-link)]).
Then we can run it using grunt mochacoverage and it will do both html and json
The definition of cov(x1,x2) is E[(x1 - E[x1])(x2 - E[x2])].
cov(x1,x2) = E[(x1-E[x1])(x2-E[x2])] = E[(x1-E[x1])(rho* x1-E[rho* x1])] = E[(x1-E[x1])(rho*(x1-E[x1]))] = E[(x1-E[x1])(x1-E[x1])] * rho = rho * E[(x1-E[x1])^2] = rho * Var(x1)
Thus cov(x1,x2) = rho * Var(x1).
Due to the way that the coverage identifies which lines have been executed, it can only test code in the same process as it is running in.
You can read more about how it works here: [https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/v4.5.x/howitworks.html (hyper-link)]
To achieve what you're after - which I assume is to get the coverage of your web server code, run your flask server with [coverage.py (hyper-link)], e.g.
coverage run --source=app flask run, then run your tests against the server as you are now (minus turning on coverage).
The coverage output will then contain info about which lines have been executed when the tavern tests were running when you kill the server.
So a quick and dirty solution might be to write your own function that doesn't do the covariance estimation but takes as input your estimated mu and sigma.
There is another way to write your own covariance estimator.
pytest --cov=paths --cov-report=html
Then open index.html from the newly created htmlcov folder.
Here is a video demonstrating achieving 100 percent test coverage.
Use coverage run to run your pexpect program and gather data:
coverage.py can combine multiple files into one for reporting.
Once you have created a number of these files, you can copy them all to a single directory, and use the combine command to combine them into one .coverage data file:
Otherwise, coverage will not have time to write the results to .coverage.
Used "coverage run --parallel-mode rift".
This was needed to (a) make sure .coverage was not overwritten by later runs and (b) make "coverage combine" work (which is automatically run by "pytest --cov")
You basically have to enable [subprocess coverage tracking (hyper-link)].
I recommend using [https://pypi.org/project/coverage_enable_subprocess/ (hyper-link)] to enable this easily.
Using parallel = 1 is recommended/required then, and you have to export COVERAGE_PROCESS_START, e.g.
export COVERAGE_PROCESS_START="$PWD/.coveragerc".
cov['tokenized_text'] = cov.apply(lambda 
              row:word_tokenize(cov['Complaint']), axis=1)
to
Both cov-emit and cov-internal-emit-clang predefine the __COVERITY__ macro, which is probably what you want.
That said, I think you should be able to mark the defect as a false positive in the Coverity Scan web UI, and it won't show up anymore.
$ cov-build --dir ~/temp cpp -x c++ -dM &1 | egrep -i "(cov|anal)"
  Coverity Build Capture (64-bit) version 7.7.0.4 on Linux 3.13.0-68-generic x86_64
As an aside, this is looking at the macros predefined by cpp, not cov-translate.
As far as I know, there is currently no straightforward way to dump all the macros predefined by cov-build/cov-translate.
np.random.multivariate_normal(mean, cov, size=n), where mean is an array with shape (m,) and cov is an array with shape (m, m), makes n draws from a multivariate normal distribution, and returns them as the rows of an array with shape (n, m).
To fix your code you can simply change [Cov] to Cov.values, the first parameter of pd.DataFrame will become a multi-dimensional numpy array:
There is now a [flag in py.test (hyper-link)] to disable coverage which you can activate when running tests from PyCharm.
The flag to use is --no-cov.
In case you receive an "unrecognized argument" error, you may need to install pytest-cov, e.g.
by pip install pytest-cov.
I found a solution based on the answer to the following question: [https://scicomp.stackexchange.com/questions/5464/parallel-computation-of-big-covariance-matrices (hyper-link)] combined with some code from the bootSVD package available here: [https://github.com/aaronjfisher/bootSVD/blob/master/R/bootstrap_functions.R (hyper-link)].
In order to get the covariance values (and not the complete covariance matrix) you need to pass in the second column as a rolling parameter:
Have you engaged with Coverity's support?
It's likely we will need detailed system configuration information in order to narrow down the culprit here - something has changed in the latest kernel/utilities/libraries that isn't playing nice with Coverity.
Issue here is that Coverity scan tools are built for rather old Linux compatibility, and newer ones have the emulation of deprecated vsyscall disabled (since kernel 4.8).
Thanks to the scan-admin@coverity.com team for their quick and precise answer!
Yes, that is what numpy.cov computes.
FWIW, I have compared the output of numpy.cov to explicitly iterating over the samples (like in the pseudocode you provided) to compare performance and the difference in the resulting output arrays is what one would expect due to floating point precision.
As you can see looking at the [source (hyper-link)], in the simplest case with no masks, and N variables with M samples each, it returns the (N, N) covariance matrix calculated as:
The presence of the COMPILING line indicates that cov-build recognizes that aampc.exe is a compiler (based on its executable path name), and has handed one of its command lines to cov-translate for further processing.
However, cov-translate seems to be confused about what the command line means.
First, it warns about its inability to query the GCC compiler version number; I don't know what aampc.exe is, but if it is not a GCC derivative then cov-configure may have been given bad information.
The absence of any further output from cov-translate means it did not see any compilation and so did nothing.
a["cov"] will return a list with a NULL element.
a[["cov"]] will return the NULL element directly.
As a consequence when your method tries to estimate 3 dimensional ellipsoid (covariance matrix) that fits your data - it fails since the optimal one is a 2 dimensional ellipse (third dimension is 0).
You will need some regularization of your covariance estimator.
There are many possible solutions, all in M step, not E step, the problem is with computing covariance:
Simple solution, instead of doing something like cov = np.cov(X) add some regularizing term, like cov = np.cov(X) + eps * np.identity(X.shape[1]) with small eps
Initially, I've passed [[3,0],[0,3]] for each cluster covariance since expected number of clusters is 3.
This makes no sense, covariance matrix values has nothing to do with amount of clusters.
They use scikit-learn and numpy to load the iris dataset obtain X and y and obtain covariance matrix:
The [documentation (hyper-link)] states that coverage.py is needed to convert the report to use full relative paths.
Suppose we have a matrix X, where each column gives observations for a specific random variable, normally we just use R base function cov(X) to get covariance matrix.
Now you want to write a covariance function yourself; that is also not difficult (I did this a long time ago as an exercise).
If we want to first get covariance, then (symmetrically) rescale it by root diagonal to get correlation, we can do:
We can also use a service R function cov2cor to convert covariance to correlation:
If cov does not have full rank, it does have some eigenvalues equal to zero and its inverse is not defined (because some of its eigenvalues would be infinitely large).
Thus, in order to be able to invert a positive semi-definite covariance matrix ("semi": not all eigenvalues are larger than zero), they use the pseudo-inverse.
If, however, cov does have full rank, the results should be the same as with the usual inverse and determinant.
To measure the coverage with pytest-cov, you have to point to the [{envsitepackagesdir} (hyper-link)].
Traditionally this is done by prepending the path to the root folder where the discovered test folder is located to [sys.path (hyper-link)].
Instead of prepending to sys.path, one can advice pytest to append the discovered root folder to it.
This is an old issue with pytest-cov and tox (first reported in [issue #38 (hyper-link)]).
from .tox/unit/lib/python3.X/site-packages if the job is named unit), while --cov=symtool instructs pytest-cov to collect coverage over the symtool dir in project root.
Now src will prevent importing code from the source tree, so --cov=symtool will collect coverage over installed modules, this being the only option.
--coverage enables -ftest-coverage, -fprofile-arcs, and also adds -u__llvm_runtime_variable on Linux, or something like that.
The former adds -femit-coverage-data and the latter adds -fprofile-instrument=clang (other options are "none" or "llvm").
-ftest-coverage adds -femit-coverage-notes
-fcoverage-mapping adds -fcoverage-mapping
-ftest-coverage: ["Don't run the GCov pass, for testing."
-femit-coverage-data: Create a GCDA file.
-femit-coverage-notes: Create a GCNO file.
(hyper-link)]
To use this function, one approach, you could round your covariance matrix.
cov-configure
Inform Coverity that you will be scanning Python code
cov-build
Inform Coverity to build your code.
cov-analyze
cov-format-errors
cov-commit-defects
Commit the scan results into your Coverity Connect central server at the specified stream.
For the commit to work you have to identify yourself using a Coverity key file (you download this key from the Coverity server Web UI), and this file needs to be readonly for the user (i.e.
chmod 400 mycoverity.key)
NOTE: All the above works fine against my company's internal Coverity server (i.e.
For the free for open source version of Coverity, things might be different (have not tested it).
It also helps giving a more accurate coverage, since e.g.
All that you need in order to tell coverage to look at the package instead of your source files is to tell it exactly that.
Having this in your .coveragerc should be enough:
Running pytest --cov tests/ looks inside the installed package correctly:
In numpy, cov  defaults to a "delta degree of freedom" of 1 while var defaults to a ddof of 0.
Simply use np.cov(x, x, bias=True) to achieve the same result.
The explanation can be found in [numpy.cov (hyper-link)] (and in [Bessel's correction (hyper-link)])
If you're amenable to adjusting your build, you can change your "compiler" to be cov-translate <args> --run-compile <original compiler command line>.
This is effectively what cov-build does under the hood (minus the run-compile since your compiler is already running), and should result in a build capture.
I downloaded and modified ( just a few modification to fit my
environment ) the [script (hyper-link)] that Travis uses to download and run Coverity
scan.
Then I installed Coverity to the host machine (in my case Travis
CI machine).
I ran the docker container and mounted the directory where the
Coverity is installed using docker run -dit -v <coverity-dir>:<container-dir>:ro ....
Executed the cov-build command and uploaded the analysis using
another part of the [script (hyper-link)] directly from docker container.
Download coverity tool archive using wget (the complete Command to use can be found in your coverity scan account)
Untar the archive into a coverity_tool directory
Start your docker container as usual without needing to mount coverity_tool directory as a volume (in case you've created coverity_tool inside the directory from where the docker container is started)
Build the project using cov-build tool inside docker
Archive the generated cov-int directory
Send the result to coverity using curl command
Also don't forget the COVERITY_SCAN_TOKEN to be encrypted and exported as an environment variable.
A concrete example is often more understandable than a long text; here is a commit that applies above steps to build and send results to coverity scan:
If you only have a single observation, covariance is not defined.
If it has one row, find the variance by using the var function in R instead of the cov function.
If it has more than one row, use cov.
Note that the covariance of a vector with itself is the same as the variance of that vector.
Excerpt from ?cov
If you need to divide by n instead of n-1, I recommend writing a special covariance function.
In aggregate(), as is common to many R functions that apply another R functions to subsets of data, you name the function you want to apply, in this case by adding FUN = cov to your aggregate() call.
You can to pass data[, "Mkt.RF"]) as argument y of function cov(), so something like this should work:
I ended up using aggregate to format the data, but it took about 50 min per calculation of cov with each factor.
coverage.xml - mypy will only allow a directory, not a filename
Why don't you create a covariance matrix by filling in the values, and then call ColumnCovariance() and RowCovariance() on it?
The issue may be with the --record-only portion of your cov-build invocation - that captures the compiler invocations, but doesn't actually emit them.
Alternatively, you could use cov-build --replay -j X to replay those compilations; some caveats apply, it's usually best to capture the compilations directly.
However note that coverage and thus these options are provided by the pytest-cov plugin which needs to be installed separately: [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-cov (hyper-link)]
Refer more on: [https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reporting.html (hyper-link)]
cov-build wraps your existing build command, monitors it and spawns parallel compiler invocations in order to understand your code.
So if you want this define to take effect for your compiler as well as Coverity's then you should simply just add it to your build the way you would normally and Coverity will see it.
If you want to add a define that only Coverity's compiler can see, this is best done with  within the config for your compiler.
I noticed you're using --preprocess-first on the cov-build command line - I recommend against this, as it destroys XREFs making it much more difficult to browse defect information, as well as makes the analysis unable to find some defects (i.e.
If you do have compilation issues, it's always good to report them (along with a reproducer) to Coverity support so that they can be fixed in future releases.
Covariance is not just a number.
That's why correlation is usually used instead of covariance (as upgraded version of it).
As for calculation pandas.Series.cov(pandas.Series) and pandas.Series.rolling(..., ddof=...).cov(pandas.Series) use (slightly?)
different algorithms: [numpy cov (hyper-link)] and [rolling cov (hyper-link)] (actually [ewmcov (hyper-link)]) respectively.
Coverity 8 definitely supports Clang.
If you're in doubt, cov-configure --list-compiler-types is a good place to start, as is the documentation.
Note that so long as your Clang binary has the default name, cov-configure --clang should be all you need.
Otherwise I strongly recommend you use --template on your cov-configure command line as well, as the CIT implementation for Clang makes heavy usage of "required" arguments and you're unlikely to get a successful capture of your build without using --template.
I suspect there's an incompatibility between this customization and Coverity's build capture libraries.
bullshtml.exe -f "bullseye.cov" -v "c:/temp"
Covariance matrix is symmetric, so you just need to compute one half of it (and copy the rest) and has variance of xi at main diagonal.
and covariance (cov)
EDIT
or, since cov(X, Y) = E(X*Y) - E(X)*E(Y)
Coverity has no idea what is new code and what is not.
First, make run Coverity on your code, then mark ALL Coverity issues as Ignore and Intentional in the CIM server.
Then, setup your Coverity Plugin to report only when NEW issues are found.
Now, when Coverity scans your code after a new code update, if any issues are found that do NOT match the existing baseline of issues, it will trigger a failure.
I tried a few versions of your cov using each of the different mean options, then one uglier "performance" version.
covariance:
covariance':
covariance'':
covariance''':
Beyond tuning the component functions, I don't know of a much more performant way of dealing with covmat, but the strict pair constructor at least should improve your space characteristics regardless of what else you do.
covariance'''':
covariance''''':
covariance'''''':
covariance''''''':
Then use coverage to assess the coverage amount, and fail if it is under:
See the [cov documentation (hyper-link)].
cov(x,y,1) or cov(x,1) as per the documentation.
The --cov parameter takes an argument saying which paths to cover.
In your example, --cov would consume test.py, but then there were no arguments left for py.test about which files to test.
The formula for covariance between two vectors X and Y each of length n is:
When you start cov-build devenv one of the things it tries to do is kill off idle msbuild.exe processes because if they are not killed, devenv will pass the build directive to msbuild without cov-build being able to see it (and that's how it knows how to build your files).
There are a few ways you can resolve this - it depends on how you are invoking cov-build, how your compiler configuration is set up, etc.
For example, you could call cov-build msbuild directly rather than going through devenv.
I would recommend opening a support case with Coverity (since you have support if you have a license for it).
E-mail them at support@coverity.com and I'm sure they can suggest additional debugging steps.
We seq between start and end then use separate_rows to make the dataframe longer and create a pos column that we can join to test_cov.
A sensible first step is to merge the two dataframes so that each line in df is added the suitable cov$Factor as in:
Basically, coefs, mean and cov are just shortcuts to get the appropriate data into the model.
With (2,2), the calculations one cov might be faster it done explicitely rather than with the det and inv functions.
The error is saying precisely what the problem is: you do not have enough data point to estimate the covariance matrix (and not to perform the fit).
Or you can have the estimate of the covariance matrix if you meet the suggested condition, i.e.
I don't know what you need the covariance matrix for, but if all you need is the error on the fit parameter, you could consider calculating this manually, e.g.
First, if you are involved in a pre-sales Proof of Concept (POC), then there should be a Coverity Sales Engineer assigned to help with the POC.
The primary purpose of cov-build is to watch the build process for invocations of compilers, and when one is found, compile the same code using the Coverity compiler (called cov-emit).
But in order to recognize a compiler, cov-build needs to know its command line name, what kind of compiler it is, where its include files are stored, etc.
This is accomplished by a helper tool called cov-configure that must be run before cov-build.
If cov-configure has not been run, then no compiler invocations will be recognized, which appears to be the case for you, as indicated by "No files were emitted".
I can't personally vouch for these commands (I don't have IAR, nor access to the Coverity tools anymore; I'm a former employee), but something like that will be needed.
Finally, for new Coverity users, I recommend using the cov-wizard tool.
cov-wizard is a graphical front-end to the command line tools, and has help text explaining the concepts and procedures, along with a convenient interface for performing them.
There are several steps even after cov-build, and cov-wizard will walk you through all of them.
doesn't exist, df.cov already exist :), bad luck.
However, the answer will depend on more than just the xi and the Pi, because there will be dependencies on all the other Kalman inputs (in particular the measurements and their covariances etc).
The solution is very simple - you have to delete first and last line in .data file:
--- BullseyeCoverage begin file 'BullseyeCoverage.data-1', data begins next line --- <<<<----- delete it
--- BullseyeCoverage end <<<<----- delete it
Without your exact matrices it's difficult to tell, but I would guess that it's because you're taking the transpose of the matrix before passing it to np.cov.
np.cov(X.T) is equivalent to np.dot(X.T, X), not np.dot(X, X.T).
cov(X,Y), where X and Y are matrices
  with the same number of elements, is
  equivalent to cov([X(:) Y(:)]).
I think you're just confused with covariance and covariance matrix, and the mathematical notation and MATLAB's function inputs do look similar.
In math, cov(x,y) means the [covariance (hyper-link)] of the two variables x and y.
In MATLAB, cov(x,y) calculates the [covariance matrix (hyper-link)] of x and y.
Here cov is a function and x and y are the inputs.
Just to make it clearer, let me denote the covariance by C. MATLAB's cov(x,y) returns a matrix of the form
Although for cov I think you still need to extract the data
It has nothing to do with hierarchical references or that you are using an NBA statement in the module cov.
Here you're assign value to dict by tuple (c, cov is equivalent to (c, cov)):
AttributeError throwing because you actually access to list: models[(c,cov)] is list that you created before (values)
but here you will get list in models[c][cov] anyway and should iterate it:
Try to remove that inline and Coverity will hopefully by happy.
It seems that Coverity hasn't been updated with the some C++11 features, like inline namespaces.
Presumably there are #ifdefs that remove all the C++11 stuff when you do call g++ with -std=c++98 but it seems that however Coverity is integrated with g++, it's not defining the same things that are necessary to avoid the C++11 features.
You should figure out what the macros that gcc uses around that C++11 code are and then make sure that Coverity is defining them appropriately as well when it analyzes your project.
Workaround by Coverity Support:
The inline namespace is a known bug in Coverity.
To bypass it, configure Coverity with the following additional options (in the config file):
Now add a Coverity define at the beginning of coverity-compiler-compat.h (also in the config dir):
After these changes the cov-build runs without errors and the analysis can be started.
You need to run the coverage measurement from the plugin itself, i.e.
If the plugin was invoked multiple times, you will need to combine the coverage files, using the coverage tool:
This will generate combined .coverage file, which can be then used to generate the desired report.
Note: Make sure you're executing the measurement part only once per vim instance, otherwise the coverage file might get rewritten.
random number) other than PID should be used to generate the name of the .coverage file.
You can't specify the type of report in the .coveragerc file.
If you want to stop using pytest-cov, then you need two commands: one to run the tests under coverage, and one to generate the report:
First, cov is the name of the covariance function, so you better call your variable e.g.
Second, you create the cov variable to be a 4-D array with value 0 at cov(1,1,1,1) and 0.5 at cov(1,1,1,2).
Depending on how the covariance matrices looks, the variable sigma can look different.
General case:
Each of the Gaussian distributions has an arbitrary covariance matrix.
2x2x3, where sigma(:,:,k) is the kth covariance matrix.
Note that of course the covariance matrices have to be symmetric and positive semidefinite.
Diagonal covariance matrices If all your covariance matrices are diagonal, you can specify sigma as a 1xdxk(1x2x3) matrix, where sigma(1,:,k) are the diagonal elements of the kth covariance matrix.
Identical covariance matrices If all k covariance matrices are identical, it is enough if you specify it once
Identical, diagonal covariance matrices If all k covariance matrices are identical diagonal matrices, sigma is a vector containing the diagonal elements
Coverage.py (which is the engine for pytest-cov) has thresholds for total coverage, but not separate thresholds for different measurements.
Coverage.py can measure statement coverage and branch coverage.
You mention "line" coverage and "code" coverage: I don't know how those differ from statement coverage.
--cov-fail-under=MIN  Fail if the total coverage is less than MIN.
like this cov="$(script.sh $name)"
$(command) makes command run and its output used as input for cov=
and double-quotes ensure that all output of command will be used for cov= (and not separated by whitespace and misinterpreted)
You can accomplish this by running cov-build with the --no-command flag.
--dir: intermediate directory to store the emitted results (used for cov-analyze later).
The coverity forums have some useful questions and answers:
[Node.js File system capture (hyper-link)]
I'm not sure about your codebase, how it's structured, but one very direct (possibly naive but it will work) solution is to create a symbolic expression for your squared covariance matrix and return that as part of your function.
For example, if y1 and y2 are part of the graph to compute cov, you can create a theano function which returns the covariance squared:
I would recommend calculating the covariance in a separate data frame, and customizing the color scale using the values in the covariance data frame:
Now create a smaller data frame that contains covariance values:
Extract the covariance values and store as a character vector:
I believe your solution is to delete your gcc-as-clang configurations and re-run cov-configure.
cov-configure --gcc
cov-configure --compiler gcc --comptype gcc --template
Did you run cov-configure yourself, or are these the configurations being shipped with SCAN?
Coverity support advised me to re-download the 8.7.0 release and it's working normally now.
Instead of using the pytest-cov plugin, use coverage to run pytest:
That way, coverage will be started before pytest.
You can achieve what you want without pytest-cov.
report -- Report coverage stats on modules.
c = cov(x);
cov(x.data) will calculate covariance.
If you upgrade to Coverity Connect 8.0 then there is.
IIRC, there is a way to invoke it from cov-manage-im as well.
what about using cov-manage-im and grep'pin for NEW?
A stable way to solve this problem would be to implement a formula for (stably) merging statistical sets, and evaluate your overall covariance using a merge tree.
You should be able to do something comparable for covariance; and resetting your computation every K*n samples should limit the drift at minimal cost.
pcov : 2d array
The estimated covariance of popt.
To compute one standard deviation errors on the parameters use perr = np.sqrt(np.diag(pcov)).
The two methods compute the covariance in a different way.
I'm not exactly sure about the method used by polyfit, but curve_fit estimates the covariance matrix by inverting J.T.dot(J), where J is the jacobian of the model.
This would make sence, because J.T.dot(J) is a first order approximation to the covariance matrix.
The function calculates the covariance matrix for all columns of MyMatrix except the first, for all rows in the relevant group, and stores the results in a 5-element list (there are 5 groups in this example).
There are actually several options; you should review the documentation on ?cov to see what they are.
If, for a given group, there are no such rows, cov(...) returns NA.
You can also first turn your dataframe into a list, and then use lapply to run the cov function on that list structure, and return a list of covariance matrices for each group.
You forgot to define summation in cov and you forgot to add summation to the new sum.
Third, numpy has a cov function, just try
This will return the covariance matrix of the variables.
In your case, you can just use np.cov(a, b)[0, 0]
The covariance and variance calculation subtracts the mean which is the same in the linear regression as including a constant.
Also, you can replace the python loop to calculate the covariance by a call to numpy.cov.
Correlation and Covariance are different.
I believe the function that you are looking for should be numpy.corrcoef rather than numpy.cov .
The relationship between correlation matrix and covariance matris is as follows:
While [pd.DataFrame.cov (hyper-link)] gets you
It seems that Coverity has this thing already figured out.
You can run Coverity as much as you like as it merges all the findings and also removes the old issues from the display.
So no need to stress, just run Coverity on the code as much as you like.
Alter your bat file such that it wraps cov-build around make
First, you are calculating the covariance of single rows of the matrix.
In order to calculate the covariance matrix, polyfit (which calls [numpy.lstsq (hyper-link)]) needs the residuals.
If you're using SimpleCov or some similar gem to generate test results, those are static HTML files that are meant to be viewed locally on your machine.
just browse to /Users/nicholasshook/Sites/<>/coverage/index.html and open that file in your browser.
Rails won't create routes to /coverage/index.html for security and manageability reasons.
If you need your coverage results to be accessible in your app, you have a few options:
Move your coverage file to the /public directory, and use a gem like High_Voltage   [https://github.com/thoughtbot/high_voltage (hyper-link)] to creat a route there
You'll need to either reconfigure your coverage tool to put files in the /public directory, or manually copy them over
I managed to do this by using the following line just after SimpleCov.start 'rails' in my spec_helper.rb file.
You should also add /public/coverage to your .gitignore file
Τhis breaks coverage.
Adding public folder as root will change the scope of files for test coverage.
This will append the numbers as strings to the lists pos and cov, so you should do what you did above and convert them to numbers.
Here is a function for computing the (unbiased) sample covariance matrix on a 3 channel image, named rgb_cov.
Just look at detailed documentation on your Coverity Connect instance
For those who came here looking to export CSV using the web interface to the Coverity server, if you open the menu sidebar, then in the "Issues by ..." and "File" sections, each subsection has a drop-down option "Export CSV" which does the job !
That line in cmdline.py should read self.coverage.save().
You should reinstall coverage.py.
I reproduced this issue running your tests locally and discovered that coverage needs the tests folder to contain an __init__.py before it will collect any data.
I added __init__.py to the tests folder and then coverage collected the data as expected.
On the PyDev side, code-coverage information is loaded from a specific directory.
In the code coverage view there's a Open cov dir (see picture below) where the coverage contents must be placed (I can see that PyDev sets --coverage_output_dir and --coverage_include -- [https://github.com/fabioz/Pydev/blob/master/plugins/org.python.pydev.debug/src/org/python/pydev/debug/ui/launching/PythonRunnerConfig.java#L913 (hyper-link)] -- in the command line when you have set Enable code coverage for new launches?
Files in the PyDev coverage directory are expected to be named: .coverage.<xxx> (then on Refresh PyDev will gather all the multiple files that start with .coverage.
and will consolidate them in a single .coverage which will then be used to show coverage info inside of PyDev).
So, what you need to do is make it so that the generated coverage files are created in the proper place (which should be possible either running from PyDev or using the proper command line arguments to create the files in the PyDev coverage dir and manually refreshing later).
Scalar covariance makes sense for covariance of two vectors, each of them representing some observations of one variable.
If this is the meaning of your data, which simply happens to be arranged in a matrix, then flatten it before applying cov.
The function cov will return a symmetric 2 by 2 matrix in which the diagonal entries are variances of each vector, and the off-diagonal entry is their covariance.
Doing the later shows full coverage
This could be the difference in the coverage.
But, I believe that other plugins are being called before pytest-cov.
The command bellow could solve the cover issue.
Also, for tests, you can try running the commands below to check which lines are not being covered and compare both:
If you want a covariance matrix describing the relationship between multiple variables, you'll need to pass in a 2D array.
By default, numpy.cov expects an numdimensions x numsamples array.
Or with a pandas dataframe, just call the cov method:
I did pytest --cov *projectname* where projectname was also the name of the folder the project is in.
The solution: I ran pytest --cov .
and sure enough my classes have 100% coverage now.
This turned out to be a problem of relative paths confusing coverage when the measured script is run from another directory.
Coverage result files ended up in that directory, instead of the root directory of the project.
To solve this, I stopped using pytest-cov, and used pure coverage instead.
define the environment variable necessary to enable subprocess coverage via export COVERAGE_PROCESS_START=/full/path/to/.coveragerc.
In the .coveragerc, the coverage result file is specified via
Then it was possible to get correct coverage measurement.
I encountered the same issue when calling "py.test --cov ..." from tox.
Using "--develop" for tox will make sure that coverage data gathering is called from the same directory as coverage analysis.
This section in tox.ini made it work for me to have a test environment for coverage:

[testenv]
setenv =
    PYTHONPATH = {toxinidir}
commands =
    pytest --cov=<your package>
    - codecov
according to this blog:
[https://thomas-cokelaer.info/blog/2017/01/pytest-cov-collects-no-data-on-travis/ (hyper-link)]
Cover is test coverage, or (Stmts - Miss) / 100.
If coverage is not 100%, that means that there are parts of your code that your tests do not cover, for example:
The above test will only ever enter the a > 0 branch and will therefore have a test coverage of 33%.
High coverage is not always good (because just covering code doesn't mean that all cases are tested adequately), but low coverage is often bad (because that means your tests are not even touching parts of your code).
Miss - total number of lines that are not covered by unittest.
Cover - percentage of all line of code that are covered by unittest.
Missing - lines of codes that are not covered.
So to fix this you can run python -m pytest -v tests --cov --cov-report=xml:coverage.xml.
First, compute your covariance matrix, then use the same apply call you have to create sub-matrices but instead of storing them just compute their determinant:
cov-build should be run in directory with source files and directory after --dir is just a place for intermediate directory which will be created.
Becareful that the mean vector and covariance matrix entries correspond to the correct variables.
On Lion g++ is an alias for llvm-g++, as you have discovered.
Basically, I changed my coverage commands to use clang instead of g++ (because the example file was pure C, I went with clang instead of clang++, which I've verified works just fine with C++ files).
From there, I was able to use lcov to generate output similar to what I'm used to seeing from Java/cobertura.
you can match the mean and covariance of an empirical distribution with a (rotated, scaled, translated) normal;
Note that the new generated data will be a normal ellipsoid, rotated, scaled, and translated to match the empirical mean and covariance of the initial data.
The method preserves covariances, while augmenting the data.
Thus the covariance matrix for them is rank 2, not rank 3.
I think you also need to specify the directory/file you want coverage for like py.test --cov=MYPKG --cov-report=html after which a html/index.html is generated.
if you do not specify --cov=/path/to/code then it will not generate the html at all.
However if we specify --cov=...
We now see that there are no stats for tests that passed, instead we see that coverage was written to HTML and sent to the default directory: ./htmlcov
NOTE: if you want a different directory, then affix :/path/to/directory to the output style html -> py.test --cov-report html:/path/to/htmldir test_smoke.py --cov=/path/to/code
If you see a plain html file, this is an indication that your problem is the --cov=/path/to/my/pkg perhaps... are you sure that the code you are testing lives here?
Navigate to the html file in htmlcov directory
C_cov is a variable (in the stats namespace we'll soon see) that  tells .Call where to find the routine that it should use to calculate covariance.
If you type C_cov at the command line, you'll get
This tells us that there's a variable named C_cov in the stats name space (your output may look slightly different from this).
Apparently C_cov is not for public consumption.
Now we just need to go to C source and follow the trail: [.../src/library/stats/src/cov.c (hyper-link)]
Updating lcov version from 1.7 to 1.9 solved the problem.
After switching it to "NO", I can now run the llvm-cov command.
Following this article [code coverage xcode 7 (hyper-link)]
I did following steps:
Enabled code coverage for project (in schema preferences)
/usr/bin/xcodebuild test -workspace MyApp.xcworkspace -scheme MyAppTests -configuration DebugMyApp -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,OS=9.3,name=iPhone 6" -enableCodeCoverage YES
slather coverage \
    --input-format profdata \
    --cobertura-xml \
    --ignore "../**/*/Xcode*" \
    --output-directory slather-report \
    --scheme MyAppTests \
    --workspace MyApp.xcworkspace \
    MyApp.xcodeproj
Later, coverage needs that function, and gets your mock instead.
You should be able to find the covariance by passing the second through 60th rows of your data into the cov function (covariance_matrix = cov(data(2:end,:))), as per [this (hyper-link)] documentation.
You can use cov with 2 arguments to compute the off-diagonal blocks.
Here is a base R solution using split (for grouping) + tcrossprod (for cov matrix)
If you write this as an if/else, I think coverage.py will do its job better.
No, coverage.py doesn't handle conditional branching within an expression.
Ned Batchelder, the maintainer of coverage.py, calls this a hidden conditional, in an [article from 2007 covering this and other cases coverage.py can't handle (hyper-link)].
If condition_b is always true when condition_a is true, you'll never find the typo in condtion_c, not if you rely solely on converage.py, because there is no support for conditional coverage (let alone more advanced concepts like [modified condition/decision coverage and multiple condition coverage (hyper-link)].
One hurdle to supporting conditional coverage is technical: coverage.py [relies heavily on Python's built-in tracing support (hyper-link)], but until recently this would only let you track execution per line.
Not that that stopped a different project, [instrumental (hyper-link)] from offering condition/decision coverage anyway.
And with coverage.py 5.0 having reached a stable state, it [appears that the project is considering adding support for condition coverage (hyper-link)], with possible sponsors to back development.
Wait for coverage.py to add condition coverage
Help write the feature for coverage.py
Here is a Scalar-valued function to perform a covariance calculation on any two column table formatted to XML.
2- Both your test: and test-cov: entries set the EXPRESS_COV environment variable to 1, meaning that you have no way to run tests without the coverage option (no way with the makefile, that is).
This may be fine if you always want to do tests with coverage, but then why have 2 entries?
If you follow this example, your test: entry should NOT set EXPRESS_COV.
3- Your gen-cov entry is wrong, it should in fact be called app-cov: based on the name of the subdirectory where you store your instrumented files.
By the way, why not choose the standard "lib-cov" (and "lib" for your non-instrumented js files)?
4- Why do you remove your instrumented files before running jscoverage?
5- test-cov should now depend on app-cov (that's probably the heart of the problem, make never detected that the dependency was outdated, because the dependency doesn't exist!).
test-cov does and should indeed set the EXPRESS_COV=1 environment variable.
6- In test-cov, your "l" in coverage.html seems to be on a separate line, though it could be the pastebin.
To recap (I've kept app and app-cov, though I suggest lib and lib-cov):
You must use the EXPRESS_COV variable as you did in the index file.
The escaped code issue can be solved without having to edit mocha's jade template by using the "--no-highlight" option for jscoverage like so:
Or I guess you could actually compute the covariance :-)
We can make use of the theorem Cov(X, Y) = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y] to calculate the covariance
[code snippet]
where we have used the fact that E[G] = mu_G and E[R] = mu_R are the respective population means.
For covariance I guess it's the same idea.
This means that if the sample number goes to infinity the covariance estimate approaches the true covariance.
After contacting the coverity support we just received the following answer and we could successfully submit a build.
Seems there was some hickup on the coverity side.
In base R, using grep we can find out columns which starts with "cov".
Looks to me like you have an extra hyphen in the name of the argument for "path-to-lcov"
According to the docs here: [https://github.com/marketplace/actions/coveralls-github-action (hyper-link)]
Try changing "path--to-lcov" to "path-to-lcov"
Calculating ρ actually involves calculating Cov(X,Y), so your last equation is mathematically correct but not helpful.
Let's go straight for estimating the covariance.
In what follows, I'm assuming that you are familiar and relatively comfortable with the definitions of mean, variance, and covariance, and understand the difference between a parameter and its estimator.
Cov(X,Y) = E[(X-μX)(Y-μY)] = E[XY] - E[X]E[Y].
Notice, in fact, that this means variance is just a special case of covariance, i.e., Var(X) = Cov(X,X)!
Given the relationship between variance and covariance pointed out above, it shouldn't surprise you to find that the MLE estimator for covariance is:
Observation: it is possible that the variance-covariance matrix in a portfolio optimization is not positive semi-definite.
First of all, sizeof(T) <= sizeof(int) should be executed at compile-time in your code, so chances are, compilation is not profiled for coverage.
Well for using gcov coverage process you should never move the files after building your project, instead you should modify your automated build scripts to build everything to the desired location.
So, the object files are instrumented in such a way that they should trigger function(added by compiler to generate coverage info ) whenever any line of statement is executed to generate *.gcda files with all the execution information.
Note: I can see that you have specified three options in question (--coverage -fprofile-arcs -ftest-coverage) which is again wrong, as --coverage works as a replacement to the other two.
If you specify only --coverage then it will do for the compilation and the linking too.
This is because the functions confint and vcov are both in the namespace "stats".
The confint() you call here effectively gets stats::vcov, pretty much because that is what namespaces are for - you are allowed to write your own versions of things but not to the detriment of otherwise expected behaviour.
Since confint.lm is calling vcov we need to ensure that (a) our new replacement for vcov is in the revised confint.lm's environment and (b) the revised confint.lm can still access the objects from its original.
To perform the above we make a new confint.lm which is the same except it has a new environment (the proxy environment) which contains our replacment vcov and whose parent in turn is the original confint.lm environment.
Broadly speaking, a covariance matrix can be created with use of the code below:
You could first try to use the cov function as discussed [here (hyper-link)].
You can calculate your covariance matrix manually.
Notice that I used the [Bessel's Correction (hyper-link)] (n-1 instead of n) because the Matlab cov function uses it, unless you specify the third argument as 1:
C = cov(___,w) specifies the normalization weight for any of the
  previous syntaxes.
The way to define the covariances using a comma is correct.
If I understand you correctly then I believe you want to recreate a covariate output like the one returned by cov function.
Covariate Function:
This is probably a little more than you need, but it should answer your question, and I think it is a nice illustration of the practical application of covariances, correlations, etc.
The llvm-cov gcov tool reads code coverage data files and displays the coverage information for a specified source file.
It is compatible with the gcov tool from version 4.2 of GCC and may also be compatible with some later versions of gcov.
This can be the reason why it is working with older version of gcov.
[https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/llvm-cov.html (hyper-link)]
I made the paths in coverage report generated by OpenCppCoverage using [OCCSonarQube plugin (hyper-link)].
I have a covariance code snipet that I refer to:
cov is the numpy array, mean is the mean in the row direction.
Then you can use the Covariance matrix to " take out the variance" by multiplying the data by the inverse covariance using the [Penrose pseudo inverse (hyper-link)]:
For most other languages (not covered by this answer or [@Thefourthbird's (hyper-link)]), you'll want to do this in two steps:
You may have configured Coverity Connect to use SSL.
grep commit.encryption <coverity-connect-install-path>/config/cim.properties
In numpy, cov defaults to a "delta degree of freedom" of 1 while var defaults to a ddof of 0.
the vs() function makes a variance structure for a given random effect, and the covariance structure for the univariate/multivariate setting is provided in the Gtc argument as a matrix, where i.e.
When the user want to provide a customized matrix as a random effect such as a marker matrix GT to do rrBLUP it has to be provided in a list() to internally help sommer to put it in the right format, whereas in the GBLUP version the random effect id which has the labels for individuals can have a covariance matrix provided in the Gu argument.
Cov= TEST[,sum(cov(.SD)[upper.tri(cov(.SD), diag = FALSE)]), by='Zone,quadrat', .SDcols=paste('Sp',1:3,sep='')]
The initial version proposed, where upper.tri() did not appear in [ ] only extracted logical values from the covariance matrix and having diag = FALSE allowed to exclude the diagonal values before summing the upper triangle of the matrix.
Also, since you're using $coverage_file in the definition of the function, you don't have to pass it.
If you want to define the functions outside the for loop, you would use $1 (not to be confused with awk's $1) and pass $coverage_file like you were doing before.
I'm not sure exactly what you are looking for with curves, but with regard to using the mahalanobis function, simply put the mean and covariance matrix in as arguments.
We need to cover it as well and then merge results generated by server.py and generated by nosetests.
Previously I was brute killing it with kill -9 and it used to kill not only server but coverage as well.
It is important to use nose-cov instead of standard coverage plugin, as it uses rcfile and allows to configure more.
In our case parallel is the key, please note data_files variable is not working for nose-coverage, so you cannot override it in .apirc and you have to use default values.
After all of that, your coverage will be all but shining with valid values.
Nose is using outstanding [coverage (hyper-link)] package under covers do the job.
You may need other options to make sure that your nose options point to the same .coverage report file as your subprocess call.
The cov() function produces the full symmetric matrix:
[diff-cover (hyper-link)] can tell you the coverage amount of the lines in your commit.
As kkuilla mentions, you can use the SVD of the original matrix, as the SVD of a matrix is related to the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of the covariance matrix as I demonstrate in the following example:
I think your covariances would be different too, but then I'm not completely clear on how you are creating these blocks.
[http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage/ (hyper-link)]
We just need to subset the columns and apply the cov by looping over the list with lapply
Try removing it and see if the coverage is corrected?
For the correlation and covariance you can use:
I think what you're looking for is a method to find all different pairs of rows in the array and then process each pair using cov?
If that's correct then I haven't heard of cov and a quick search through the documentation doesn't help.
Beyond that I can't help unless you correct my understanding of your question or direct me to some documentation of the cov subroutine.
Also, see the first on-line draft of the [PDL Book (hyper-link)] which has more comprehensive coverage of PDL computation and threading.
When I follow the example in ?lavaan::cor2cov I get this:
where cov(tau.hat) = Sigma.
To access covariance/correlation use
2) cov returns the covariance matrix, not the correlation; while the covariance matrix is used in calculating the correlation, it is not the measure you're looking for.
Like OP, I was using pytest-cov to measure code coverage through subprocesses.
pytest-cov's documentation contains this small note, that annoyingly isn't mentioned on the page dedicated to subprocess pitfalls ([https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#limitations (hyper-link)])
The python used by the subprocess must have pytest-cov installed.
The subprocess must do normal site initialisation so that the environment variables can be detected and coverage started.
Anyway, I was installing pytest-cov as part of tox workflow, so it presumably got installed into whatever environment tox created.
Shelling out to my CLI app meant that it then used the Python interpreter from Travis' environment, which didn't have pytest-cov installed.
Firstly, For Coverage ([https://gist.github.com/lucascorrea/80f3d57a7f97b2365ef39839eefe68a1 (hyper-link)])
convert to coverage data with xcrun llvm-cov show that sonar can recognize
configure sonar.swift.coverage.reportPath to the report path generated by xcrun
you can run sonar-scanner to submit coverage data
After done the two things
You can check the coverage AND unit test in the column in sonarqube website!
The problem lies somewhere else: The [singular values (hyper-link)] of v are the square roots of the eigenvalues of v'*v. If v is mean-free, then v'*v (in this case called "scatter matrix") is identical to the (unbiased-estimator) covariance matrix cov(v) – up to a factor size(v, 1) - 1.
Well, checking promises for coverage should not be too hard because JavaScript has absolutely sick aspect oriented programming abilities.
Each .then clause has 3 branches (one for success, one for failure, one for progress), if you want loop coverage too, you'd want each progress event when progress is attached to fire zero times, once and multiple times - although let's avoid progress for this question and in general since it's being deprecated and replaced in Q.
SonarPython, like all code analyzers that import coverage report, requires that analyzed source code is strictly identical to the one used to generate the coverage report.
And, if you really need to run sonar-scanner on a branch merged with master, you also need to run the coverage analysis on the same branch merged with master.
by using [pytest-html (hyper-link)] plugin (pytest-cov has native support for [html report generation (hyper-link)]).
Just add this to your .simplecov configuration file:
For reference, I also included a matrix math method, a simple for loop method using cov(), and a cellfun() method using a custom fncovariance() function (note I modified it from yours above).
Covariance is a measure of the degree to which returns on two assets (or any two vector or array) move in tandem.
A positive covariance means that asset returns move together, while a negative covariance means returns move inversely.
So, portfolio managers try to reduce covariance between two assets and keep the correlation coefficient negative to have enough diversification in the portfolio.
Maybe you meant correlation coefficient close to zero, not covariance.
However, I tried the code you are providing here and the closer covariance matrix I get is this one :
To understand why the numbers in your cov_matrix are so huge you should first understand what is a covarance matrix.
The covariance matrix is is a matrix that has as elements in the i, j position the the covariance between the i-th and j-th elements of a random vector.
A good link you might check is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_matrix (hyper-link)] .
COV.
{0,3}(2|19) - COV substring (case insensitive), then any zero to three chars, and then either 2 or 19
Here's what you should expect from the covariance matrix cov:
[http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/cov.html (hyper-link)]
And afterwards when you perform any kind of execution the object files trigger coverage generation functions and generate .gcda files at the same location as '.gcno' and object files.
This can happen if the environment variable GCOV_PREFIX is set.
See [here (hyper-link)]
The suggested solution is to release the .gcno files to $GCOV_PREFIX by doing something like
You have set the COVFILE env variable, compiled your code using Bullseye gcc wrapper compiler.
Now you should run your compiled code, and only then you will see the coverage raising.
I have Coverity analysis installed in C:/cygwin/home/peterd/cov-analysis-win64-8.7.1 and thus can access documentation in a web browser at file:///C:/cygwin/home/peterd/cov-analysis-win64-8.7.1/doc/index.html
Specifically, the command reference is at file:///C:/cygwin/home/peterd/cov-analysis-win64-8.7.1/doc/en/cov_command_ref.html
This should calculate the covariance (according to your formula), given your sample inputs:
So let's take two length-3 collections over which you want to calculate the covariance.
I mean your covariance equals to = 1.6666666666666667
But in real world covariance equals to = 1.25
please check: [https://www.easycalculation.com/statistics/covariance.php (hyper-link)]
I fixed the test coverage to 94% by [this patch (hyper-link)] that simplifies import dependencies and by the command:
Uncovered lines are only in conditional commands or in some less used functions but all headers are completely covered.
Therefore I think that pytest_cov plugin works correctly if it ignores everything that was imported together with this file, although it is a pain.
I excluded also __init__.py and settings.py from the report because they are simple and with the complete coverage but they are also imported prematurely in the dependency of conftest.
Get rid of pytest-cov!
This way you're just running a coverage on your current py.test configuration, which works perfectly fine!
It's also philosophically the right way to go: Make each program do one thing well - py.test runs tests and coverage checks the code coverage.
pytest-cov hasn't been working properly for a while now.
As of 2014, pytest-cov seems to have changed hands.
py.test --cov jedi test seems to be a useful command again (look at the comments).
But in combination with xdist it can speed up your coverage reports.
I had this problem with py.test, the coverage and the django plugin.
Apparently the model files are imported before coverage is started.
Not even "-p coverage" for early-loading of the coverage-plugin worked.
In my case, all the tests run, but coverage was 0%.
Resulting coverage is 0%.
Now is the coverage 90%.
For this reason I stopped using pytest-cov and follow the advice to use coverage tool instead.
One way is to use empirical parameter covariance matrix using the COVB option available in proc GENMOD.
In order to use the empirical covariance matrix estimator (also known as robust variance estimator, or sandwich estimator or Huber-White method) we should add the covb option to repeated statement in proc genmod:
To do so, merely calculate the sample mean and sample covariance: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#Estimation_of_parameters (hyper-link)] or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_mean_and_covariance (hyper-link)]
Note that the standard k-means clustering algorithms (and other common algorithms like EM) are very fickle in that they will give you different answers depending on how you initialize, so you may wish to perform appropriate regularization to penalize "bad" solutions as you discover them.
covariance is a property of two random variables, which is a rough measure of how much changing one affects the other
a covariance matrix is merely a representation for the NxM separate covariances, cov(x_i,y_j), each element from the set X=(x1,x2,...,xN) and Y=(y1,y2,...,yN)
So the question boils down to, what you are actually trying to do with this "covariance matrix" you are searching for?
I'm not sure how covariance generalizes to vectors, but I would guess that the covariance between two vectors x and y is just E[x dot y] - (E[x] dot E[y]) (basically replace multiplication with dot product) which would give you a scalar, one scalar per element of your covariance matrix.
Or perhaps you could find the covariance matrix for each dimension separately.
Thus, when the foo function needs to be 'defined' in function main, the linker finds cov variable previously defined in inline function foo and issues the error.
Let’s make the pre-processor's work and expand COV() define to help to clarify the problem:
To facilitate reasoning, let’s alter the section attribute of definition in foo inline function to cov.2 just to compile the code.
We can see that compiler makes foo::cov, in section cov.2 GLOBAL (signed by ‘u’ letter).
When we use the same section name (cov), the compiler, trying to ‘define’ foo in main block encounters a previous globally  defined cov and the issues the error.
), which avoids compiler to emit code for inline function and just copies it at expansion time, you’ll see the error disappears, because there isn't a global foo::cov.
This reduces branch coverage as it is a conditional that wasn't being tested.
Use --cov {envsitepackagesdir}/<your-package-name> in tox.ini.
See: 
[Using py.test with coverage doesn't include imports (hyper-link)]
I got rid of using pytest-cov and run coverage outright instead..
If you just want to know about the math used to generate and transform the 2D gaussian PDF, check out the mvpdf function (and the rot and getcov functions it depends on):
It is possible to scale and rotate a multivariate gaussian distribution via its covariance matrix.
on windows you should use clang-cl.exe with --coverage option.
This link will help you to do that... 
[https://marco-c.github.io/2018/01/09/code-coverage-with-clang-on-windows.html (hyper-link)]
covs is singular so it cannot be inverted.
If a Moore-Penrose generalized inverse is sufficient then MASS::ginv(covs) could be used.
You can use apply to get the covariance of s with each column fairly easily.
Using apply to get the covariance:
If you check the [documentation for reporting (hyper-link)] in pytest-cov, you can see how to manipulate the report and generate extra versions.
For example, adding the option --cov-report term-missing you'll get the missing lines printed in the terminal.
A more user friendly option, would be to generate an html report by usign the --cov-report html option.
Then you can navigate to the generated folder (htmlcov by default) and open the index.html with your browser and navigate your source code where the missing lines are highlighted.
In addition to the [answer from Ignacio (hyper-link)], one can also set [show_missing = true (hyper-link)] in .coveragerc, as pytest-cov reads that config file as well.
coveralls only highlights lines it has been told to
When a source file is uploaded it is up to the client to mark each line as covered or not and coveralls just renders what it has been supplied (see the [API (hyper-link)] documentation)
If your tool does not mark the line properly then coveralls will not render it
I manage to fix the problem, it was due to the way I was calling coverage, I was importing something from the module before starting coverity.
Coverage was added at runtime when you did python setup.py test, if the module was present.
Importing a module before starting coverage will get you into cases where coverage is incomplete or not run at all.
Well, it appears that Xamarin has removed the 'internal' cov profiler and monocov will not produce any output (besides mono actually loading the shared library, no functions are called) as the api has changed.
They have added a code coverage filter (Apr 7 2015) to the core log profilers and while I could not find any published documentation(?).
Git log info on cov removal and log coverage filter addition:
Ignore Code Coverage
You can prevent some files from being taken into account for code
  coverage by unit tests.
To do so, go to Administration > General Settings > Analysis Scope >
  Code Coverage and set the Coverage Exclusions property
I found out that coverage does not import the module so when i ran:
pytest tests/test_unit.py --cov=.
i got full coverage and all my tests passed.
The coverage report then shows the function as never called (orange/red) if i indeed do not call it explicitly in code.
I once had a similar issue and it turned out that some of the unreported code was being loaded before SimpleCov was started.
Dataframes have a covariance method that computes the covariances between all columns in the DataFrame.
Cov is now a dataframe that contains the covariences between all the columns in your vector.
Before starting cov-build, configure the compiler which will execute the source file.
As you said you are working on C++ source code, use GCC compiler to configure with Coverity Static Analyzer.
Coverity Directly supports for 3 Compilers(Gcc and 2 more).
To configure this GCC use cov-configure command followed by gcc.
Then use cov-build command to analyze.
Then cov-analyze command will be analyze that emit folder and create Output Directory in given path.
Not listed under CLI-Options, but there is coverageThreshold, which can be used in package.json or within an extra jest configuration file:
[https://jestjs.io/docs/en/configuration#coveragethreshold-object (hyper-link)]
Accordingly, you need to set your point as the lower boundary, +inf (or some arbitrarily high enough value) as the upper boundary and provide the means and covariance matrix you already have:
As an example, in a multivariate normal distribution with diagonal covariance the cfd should give (1/4) * Total area = 0.25 (look at the scatterplot below if you don't understand why) The following example will allow you to play with it:
cov(X,Y) is equivalent to cov([x(:) y(:)]).
But [x(:) y(:)] is 20000 by 2 for you, and cov() treats rows as observations and columns as dimensions, so you get a 2 by 2 covariance matrix.
This configuration option isn't part of pytest-cov.
In the configuration file for the underlying tool coverage.py, which is called .coveragerc by default, you can add:
See the documentation for details: [https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/master/doc/config.rst (hyper-link)]
[Simeon's answer (hyper-link)] is still relevant to choose this output directory through coverage configuration file
Note: Consider not using cov as a variable because it is a MATLAB function.
Option 1: Try using _mocha instead of mocha to avoid mocha forking and not covering all of your code in the same process.
Option 2: I highly recommend istanbul as a coverage tool.
I'm investigate coverage for eval controllers in the next release of Blanket (v1.1.3).
