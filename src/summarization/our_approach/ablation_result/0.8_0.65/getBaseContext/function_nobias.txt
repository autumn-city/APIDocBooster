The getBaseContext() is the method of ContextWrapper.  And ContextWrapper is, "Proxying implementation of Context that simply delegates all of its calls to another Context. Can be subclassed to modify behavior without changing the original Context." (as per javadocs)
The method getBaseContext() can be used to access the “base” Context that the ContextWrapper wraps around.  You might need to access the “base” context if you need to, for example, check whether it’s a Service, Activity or Application:
getBaseContext() -  If you want to access Context from another context within application you can access. 
Or if you need to call the “unwrapped” version of a method: 
The same logic applies to getApplication() vs. getApplicationContext().
