Would you even want to override [Activity|ViewGroup|View].dispatchTouchEvent?  Unless you are doing some custom routing you probably should not.
The main extension methods are ViewGroup.onInterceptTouchEvent if you want to spy and/or intercept touch event at the parent level and View.onTouchListener/View.onTouchEvent for main event handling.
