,,I could solve the problem myself.,Feeding LSTMCell with whole sentences using embeddings gives dimensionality error,www.stackoverflow.com/questions/54054455,"So currently i'm sitting on a text-classification problem, but i can't even set up my model in Tensorflow. I have a batch of sentences of length 70 (using padding) and i'm using a embedding_lookup with an embedding size of 300. Here the code for the embedding:
[code snippet]
So now inputs should be of shape [batch_size, sentence_length, embedding_size] which is not surprising. Now sadly i'm getting a ValueError for my LSTMCell since it is expecting ndim=2 and obviously inputs is of ndim=3. I have not found a way to change the expected input shape of the LSTM Layer. Here is the code for my LSTMCell init:
[code snippet]
The error is triggered in the call function of the cell, that looks like this:
