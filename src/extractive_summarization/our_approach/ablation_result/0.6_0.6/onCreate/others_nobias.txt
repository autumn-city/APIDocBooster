 And then that query you have to execute inside the callback method onCreate, which you have to override once you extend a class with the SQLiteOpenHelper class.  So that query you have to execute inside the onCreate.  Either you can execute it directly-- you can put the whole query directly inside a db.exeSQL. 
 If the database already exists, but I've indicated through the database version value that I'm changing the version, that is that I've incremented it, then the onUpgrade method will be called. 
 And again, pass the control back to onCreate, because in onCreate, there will be a new table created for you. 
 I'll call the onCreate method. 
For what it's worth, it's also a bad idea to catch exceptions in onCreate().  If the method returns successfully (doesn't throw), the framework thinks the database was created successfully.
