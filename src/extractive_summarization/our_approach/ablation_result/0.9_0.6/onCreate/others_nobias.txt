 And then that query you have to execute inside the callback method onCreate, which you have to override once you extend a class with the SQLiteOpenHelper class.  So that query you have to execute inside the onCreate.  Either you can execute it directly-- you can put the whole query directly inside a db.exeSQL. 
 If the database already exists, but I've indicated through the database version value that I'm changing the version, that is that I've incremented it, then the onUpgrade method will be called. 
 And again, pass the control back to onCreate, because in onCreate, there will be a new table created for you. 
 In the onCreate method, you should add code that creates your database tables and if you like, you can also add code to add data. 
 Now I'll go down to my onCreate method, and I'll place the cursor right here before I call the ArrayAdapter code and I'll instantiate the dbhelper object.  I'll say dbhelper = new, and then I'll use my new class constructor method and I'll pass in this as the context, and then I'll get a reference to the database.  I'll call database = dbhelper.  And then I'll call a method that this class has inherited from SQLite database.  This returns a reference to the connection to the database, and I'll be able to use that connection to do things like inserting data, retrieving data, updating, and deleting.  Simply by calling the method, that will trigger the onCreate method of my database open helper class, and in turn that will create the table structure.
