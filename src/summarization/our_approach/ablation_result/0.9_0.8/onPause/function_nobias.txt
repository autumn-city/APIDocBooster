If you can still see any part of it (Activity coming to foreground either doesn't occupy the whole screen, or it is somewhat transparent), onPause() will be called. 
onPause()- Screen is partially covered by other new activity. 
onPause() + onStop()- Screen is fully covered by other new activity. 
1- a part of previous activity is visible or the new activity is transparent: only onPause will be called. 
Being in the foreground means that the activity has input focus.
