>> Welcome back to another episode
of this week on Channel 9.
I'm your host, Christina
Warren, Senior Cloud Advocate.
Apologies for the lack
of show last week,
I was swamped finalizing
some content for Microsoft
Ignite, but I will be
sure to mention any of
the major stuff that
we missed last week this week.
For anyone who's curious,
my shirt today is from
the Stella McCartney by Taylor
Swift Club which will make
the viewers who both hate
it when I talk about
Taylor Swift and when I
wear bushy things angry,
so everyone loses except for
me because I love this hoodie.
Okay. Enough about all of that,
let's get into this
week's latest dev news.
So first up, just a
reminder that we are
less than a month away from
Microsoft Ignite in Orlando.
The event is sold out but you
can still enjoy the conference
online and so we'll be streaming
a lot of the sessions
and the keynotes.
This is one of Microsoft's
biggest events
for developers and IT pros,
and I can't wait for you to
see all of what's going
to get announced.
I'm going to be there along
with your Channel 9 favorites,
so if you see me on the show floor or
at a session be sure to say hello.
If you can't make it to Orlando,
Microsoft Ignite The Tour is
coming back too, and we're going
to be in 30 cities across the globe
this year delivering great content.
The first stop is in Paris the week
after Ignite, and I will
actually be at that stop.
So if you're in Paris,
please say bonjour.
Links to both Microsoft
Ignite and Microsoft Ignite,
the tour are in the show notes
and the description down below.
Now, next up since
we missed last week,
I did want to give a
really quick shout-out to
the new Surface hardware
that was announced
at the Surface Event
in New York City.
So the Surface Team announced
the new Surface Pro
7, the Surface Pro X,
the Surface Laptop 3 which is
now available in a
15-inch size as well,
and Surface earbuds and all of
those will be in stores soon.
Then Panos Panay also showed off
a preview of the Surface Neo and
Surface Duo which are
two dual screen devices that
will be out next holiday season.
So I've got links to the Surface blog
with more details as
well as an episode
of Microsoft Mechanics that
details the hardware
on the new laptops.
So those are in the show notes
in the description down below.
All of this is really cool,
and I want the Rose Gold,
excuse me, Sandstone
Surface Laptop 3.
In some Visual Studio Code news,
Visual Studio September 2019
build is now available,
and this includes some
great new features
like the ability to view the
selection in the minimap,
you can open the integrated terminal
and a custom working directory,
and it also updates the remote
development extensions.
So it links the full
release notes as well as
the download page for VS Code
are in the show notes
and description.
In addition to the new
version of VS Code,
the Python for VS Code extension
got a big update this
month and it actually
add support for native editing of
Jupyter Notebooks inside
Visual Studio code.
So you can now directly
edit your IPYNB files
and you get the full interactivity of
Jupyter Notebooks but with
all the power VS Code.
So you can manage source control
and open multiple files and you
can use features like
IntelliSense and Git integration
and multi file management.
It's great, and it offers
a great experience for
data scientists and developers to
experiment and work
with data efficiently.
So more details and links to
the Python extension are in
the show notes in the
description down below.
While we're talking about Python,
I wanted to give a
quick shout out that
PyTorch 1.3 is now
available and so I've got
a link to the PyTorch
Teams blog post outlining
all the new things in
that release in the show
notes and description.
In some Java news, aka
Bruno's Java corner,
there's some great news
for developers who
use Spring Boot and Spring Cloud.
So to make it simple to
deploy and operate Spring
Cloud applications,
Microsoft has partnered with Pivotal
to create Azure Spring Cloud.
So Azure Spring Cloud is a
way that it strucks away
the complexity of
infrastructure management and
Spring Cloud middleware management,
and so you can focus on building
your business logic and let Azure
take care of the dynamic scaling,
security patches, compliance,
and high availability.
So I've got links to the announcement
blog for Azure Spring Cloud,
both from Microsoft and
Pivotal in the show notes
and the description.
In some GitHub actions news,
GitHub has released
some workflow examples
from various open source maintainers.
So GitHub actions is still in Beta
but it will be generally
available November 13th,
the day after my birthday,
and you can sign up
for early access now.
So I've got to link to
GitHub's blog posts
which shows off some of these actions
as well as a community
curated collection
in the show notes and the description
which gives more details.
Earlier this year, Windows
Virtual Desktop for
Azure launched in preview
and so good news,
it is now in generally
available worldwide.
So with Windows Virtual desktop,
you can deploy and scale your
Windows desktops and apps on
Azure in minutes and so
more details are linked in the
show notes and description.
In some Xamarin News,
the Xamarin Team is taking
part in Hacktoberfest
and so if you want to earn
a Xamarin sticker set,
you need to make one more pull
request to Xamarin projects.
Four more PRS will earn
you a t-shirt and 10 more
will get you a limited
edition glass trophy.
All these are stackable so
you can get multiple awards.
So there are more details on
Hacktoberfest linked down below.
Also, remember that this month,
you can participate in the Xamarin
and Azure Functions Challenge
for your chance to win prizes that
include like Xbox Gold gift cards,
a pair of Surface headphones.
So links to that challenge are
down below in the show
notes and description too.
On Channel 9, this week, we've
got tons of great contents.
So first up on Careers
Behind the Code,
Scott Hanselman, everyone's
favorite developer,
talks about building
careers with empathy.
I love this episode.
Over on the Cloud Native Show,
Shayne learns about Cloud
Native configurations
and settings and ASP.net core.
Then over on the IoT Show,
Olivier talks Azure IoT Hub
integration with Azure Event Grid.
So I've got links to all those
videos down below as well.
Now, it's time for
my pick of the week.
So I don't really get to play
as many video games as I would
like, but I've
Untitled Goose Game a couple of
weeks back, and I remain obsessed.
So this game which is
available for Mac,
PC and Nintendo Switch for now,
let's you play the role of a
goose, and this goose is a jerk,
but you get wreak havoc and
play pranks on a whole village.
It's so much fun.
It's adorable, it's challenging and
honestly who doesn't love
being a jerky goose.
I do, right. So if you're looking
for something fun and different,
I highly recommend this game.
Well, that does it for me.
